The Year the Superstar Dj Died


WEB EXCLUSIVE!: Dinosaurs rule the dancefloors no more
By JEAN CAREY

Thursday, December 28, 2006 - 2:01 pm


For nearly a decade, the giants of electronic dance music, a cold-blooded cadre mostly from northern Europe, lumbered across the earth. Tiesto, Paul van Dyk, Paul Oakenfold, Seb Fontaine, Judge Jules and Fatboy Slim dominated small suburban dancefloors and Ibizan caverns alike with crafty disco assembled from chest-rattling basslines and sampled treasures from earlier civilizations.

Suddenly, in 2006, like dinosaurs shuddering in the freezing contrail of a passing comet, the time of the superstar DJs ended. Today, the big boys are gasping for space as overpaid nightclub hosts, while small, furry mammals named Busdriver, Ellen Alien, and Otto Von Schirach have sprung forth to occupy their musical niche in the ecosystem.

The sad thing—one of the sad things—about the superstar DJs' looming extinction is that they didn't begin with Brontosaurus brains. IDM, or "intelligent dance music," is the obviously and deliberately limiting terminology for electronica that isn't stupid. The expression dates back to a description of Coil's 1991 album The Snow, which set the IQ bar pretty high, and the artists who followed in the last decade of the century--the Orb, Autechre, Future Sound of London--kept apace.

By 2000, European electronic dance music evolved into dozens of microgenres from the various species of house music, techno and EBM. Pioneering DJs such as Oakenfold and Fatboy Slim found they could press their popular discs and also attract respectable concert attendance numbers through careful marketing of their riveting live sets, which blended their own compositions with remixes of other artists' tracks. Meanwhile, in the States, dance music factions were essentially limited to house and trance, a situation that continues today.

And why shouldn't it? Americans almost always muck up the nuance in the cultures we import, and dance music has proven no exception. While European DJs cultivated a humbly anonymous aesthetic, Americans reinvented the DJ as turntable-toting rock star. Thus today we enjoy the Crystal Method's relentless efforts to brand their faces on such maximum party records as the cleverly named Tweekend and Legion of Boom, and this year, both the Crystal Method and taggers-along LCD Soundsystem produced 45-minute "workout mixes" in association with Nike.

But it is now clear that the DJ craze is on the wane in the U.S. The huge throngs that once welcomed Van Dyk, Carl Cox and the ubiquitous Oakenfold have dried up, at least in the smaller major cities. Once people in places like Dallas and Atlanta figured out the headliner would show up at 3 a.m., play a 20-minute set and split, it was all over, and from then on, guys like that were forced to retreat to hosting superclubs in tried-and-true markets in Miami, New York and San Francisco.

"An adult is one who has lost the grace, the freshness, the innocence of the child, who is no longer capable of feeling pure joy, who makes everything complicated, who spreads suffering everywhere, who is afraid of being happy, and who, because it is easier to bear, has gone back to sleep.  The wise man is a happy child."
-Arnaud Desjardins

"Music rots when it gets too far from the dance.  Poetry atrophies when it gets too far from the music."

The only thing I find rather funny is talking about IDM as a prelude to EBM.

Might as well say that Discopunk is a prelude to Hip Hop. *snicker*

Aside from that, ya.  Good read.

Subject: [sfraves] you down wit KFJC? (yeh you know mee!)

having not even a tape deck in my truck and only AM/FM radio has allowed 
me to appreciate the finer things in life.. such as the national weather 
service computer vocoded radio broadcasts on am radio, which i find very 
cathartic and meditative, to awesome consistently avant garde Foothills 
Junior College broadcasts at FM 89.7. i mean, like i've been listening 
in the last few months for any waivering in weirdness and so far KFJC 
makes KALX 90.7 look like top 40 radio. i've never heard so much tuvan 
throat singing! `;) on any given moment there could be grindcore, idm, 
freejazz, to turntablism in the same hour.

if you're already familiar with this station, you can call me a newbie 
but i just love this station. if you haven't heard this station put an 
ear out or a really big antenna and tune in. 89.7 has renewed my hope 
for radio in general. if you're lazy scope the 
netcast..http://www.kfjc.org/netcast/index.php but i personally think 
the static adds a more homey feel to the station. `;)

hey while i'm at it, big ups 2 my man down there in KZSU for still 
making it happen.. anyone catch the solstice marathon?

respex to all.

Forget Janet Jackson.

This is how they do it, "Wardrobe Malfunction" Stylee on *live* National
TV in Japan on New Year's Eve, 2007:

won't be sorry.

Don't know if this one has made the rounds yet, it's a modern day update

laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure of,
but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any size,
and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with people, you
can be certain that the vast majority of those people haven't actually
taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever ancient, "Sacred
Text" that they subscribe to,because if they had read it, that House
of Worship would be nearly empty."

10 years ago I would have laughed at this.  Now I laugh at it in a  
different way!  Now I believe every word of it!   Be very leary of  
establishment media ... Russia merely appeared to shed communism, who  
really knows about Saddam because the man literally has multiple  
doubles and I haven't seen the picture they're circulating but it  
just smells staged, think about it ...

... and the Iraq war?  It's time to dispel that one, too.  All over  
the media how we're botching up the war and the solution is to send  
more troops in.  Reality?  The country is in total receivership, the  
spigots are turned off, and the price of gas is astronomical.

Maybe I should say "gastronomical"?  =]

The Edward R. Murrow, serve the public interest thing in bringing the
American Public the unbiased news out of a sense of civic duty from
the Big 3 TV Networks died in 1977 when Roone Arledge took ABC News
and began to run it for profit.

Since then, the only reason that TV News exists, (and that's
*everything* you see to include CNN, MSNBC, and of course FUX, as well
as CBS, NBC and ABC) is to:

Sell advertising.

Especially bottled water, flouridated, or otherwise, since it sells
for 4 times the price of gasoline, at $10 a gallon.

Gotta make it look sexy so people will forget just how much they're
paying for it.

That's it.

I klnow you're trying to keep these quotes of the day on a positive
footing, but this bit of Rudery from his Ruderiness is so powerful I
couldn't not not share it.

To wit:

"Red state, blue state; by the time it's said and done we may all have

Better yet, well water from you own land in the hills, like my mom has.

Just make sure your well is higher elevation than the neighbors septic tank 
and leech field.

Thanks for the plug!  (And I'll definitely get a copy of that recording 
to you.  MP3 organization hasn't been my strong suit.)  KFJC is 
generally a great station in my mind, if only sometimes a bit TOO 
narrowminded.

Which brings up another special we're going to be airing at KZSU. 
You see, KZSU is rapidly approaching its 60th Anniversary on January 6, 
2007. To celebrate we're having a 60 hour marathon, an hour for every 
year we've been on the air.

That's right, starting with 1947 at noon on January 4th and running 
through 2006 ending at 11:59pm on January 6th we're going to broadcast 
an hour for every year we've been on the air.  (I'll be airing 1985, and 
what I've rounded up has me REALLY excited.  Jacki-O is following my 
with 1986, so it could be out of control.)

I do hope you all tune in!

And I can't forget that I hope you all have a fantastic '07!  (Seems 
ominous that we all should, no??)

i don't mean to sound offensive to your hometown, but I don't think I  
could live in Milpitas.  I'm actually thinking about Oregon, though.   
I've got an appointment with UCSC though first.  By the way, anyone  
heard of the Free Talk Live drive to move everyone to New Hampshire?   
I don't know if I'd go for that, but it's a nice idea, and not a bad  
state either, of what little there is of it.

slippery slopes of world fascist socialism.

convince 1 person that doesn't believe in this just how long this  
little meeting of the minds has been going on, how many avenues they  
have their hands in, and that if they succeed at this goal, it will  
not be good for anyone, not even the perpetrators.  and there are  
people putting this on, but for the most part they are completely  
behind the scenes from a mainstream media standpoint.

anyone up to it?

2006: The Year America Died
Our Commentary on the year past and the year ahead

Steve Watson & Alex Jones
http://Infowars.net
Tuesday, January 2, 2007

2006 was the year that the United States died. Over the course of a  
year, just a few seconds in the span of a country, it's civilization  
and their way of life, we have witnessed the premature death of  
America. The underpinnings, the basic canons and the tenets of the  
United States, as well as it's physical borders, are gone.

But they can be brought back.

The problem is denial. You cannot put something right until you  
identify it as a wrong. The New World Order has won a major victory,  
but because the country is made up of living tissue, each and every  
one of us out there, every man woman and child, it can rise from the  
dead. We can revive the country by passing electricity through its  
heart.

Until recently Europe was deep in the EU but as the final steps were  
being implemented, the people pulled back and voted down EU expansion  
in every country. The same has happened in South America. So we do  
see whole regions, countries and areas rising from the dead in this  
sense.

The good name of America has been used for global corporate empire  
and the country has been turned from the most loved around the world  
into the most hated and despised.

2006 was the year that implementation of the American Union began.  
According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the merger is on track  
or ahead of schedule.

The open plan to merge the US with Mexico and Canada and create a Pan  
American Union has long been a Globalist brainchild but its very real  
and prescient implementation on behalf of the Council on Foreign  
Relations has finally been reported on by mainstream news outlets.

The framework on which the American Union is being pegged is the  
NAFTA Super Highway, a four football-fields-wide leviathan that  
stretches from southern Mexico through the US up to Montreal Canada.  
Coupled with Bush's blanket amnesty program, which the Democrats in  
congress are set to approve this week as their first order of  
business, the Pan American Union is the final jigsaw piece for the  
total dismantling of America as we know it.

---------------------------------------

Social Security, roads, military, intelligence gathering,  
regulations, federal agencies - all within the US, Canada and Mexico  
are being merged into one system at the cost of national sovereignty  
and the common law. What we were is being replaced with the new - no  
liberty, no due process, no freedom, no families, forced drugging, no  
jobs of any significance, no control of your own destiny - in short,  
total control of our lives.

They are not just in name merging the agencies and the laws and the  
regulations, they are physically getting rid of the borders by buying  
off and lobbying the politicians at the state level, who then hand  
the roads over to international bodies and their subsidiary companies.

The armed forces has also seen an influx of foreign troops, an  
average of 20% of ground troops in Iraq are now non citizens, this is  
set to rise to 50% over the next year with foreign recruitment  
stations facilitating the supply.

Think about this, non-US citizens wearing the uniform of American  
soldiers. These troops would be more likely to fire on US citizens  
and follow orders. Every empire, when it represses its own people,  
brings in foreign troops to do the job. Urban warfare drills we have  
covered over the years show that the military is being prepared for  
this.

2007 will be the year of the American Union's fruition. Will the  
people stand up to it and protest its programs? will they realise how  
dire the situation is or will they capitulate and accept it?

Simultaneously in 2007 they are announcing from Texas to Indiana,  
from Oregon to New York, that foreign companies are being given, at  
fire sale prices, the infrastructure of America. The ports and the  
roads are to be used as taxing mechanisms to fund the North American  
Union. Toll roads are to be placed upon existing roads in Security  
Prosperity Partnership agreements that bypasses Congress, agreements  
between the bureaucracies of the US and Mexican governments, to raise  
capital to build the Super highway that will go South of Texas and  
into Mexico.

SPP documents reveal that out of 85 interstate highways, 83 of them  
are slated to go under this agreement and toll roads are going down  
on them already. The money from this operation with further fund the  
dismantling of US sovereignty by seizing the infrastructure at it's  
very heart in a bloodless coup.

The US is now being used as the primary tool of globalist corporate  
fascism and the world is wrongly blaming the people of America for  
all the ills that they perceive the US to be responsible for.

In 2007 Americans need to send a message to the rest of the world  
that they are being used as puppets and are committed to fighting  
back against the hijacking of their country. Parasites have attacked  
the central nervous system of America, they have taken control of the  
central government and expanded it's power, seized full control of  
the nation and turned it into an engine of warfare to dominate other  
nations. And once they take over those other nations, they will turn  
them into engines of warfare to project and expand the power.

In order to revive America, its people need to expose the hijackers,  
the new world order crime syndicate, and their programs and  
operations. Then people on the left and right can wake up from this  
false paradigm and see that both parties are controlled by the same  
private interest groups.

Americans also need to send a message to the rest of the world and  
punish those who have enabled its downfall, such as a President who  
has been played by private interest power mongers who have no  
allegiance to the Constitution. The people need to show that they do  
not stand for the crimes for which America has been used to commit.

Such action by the informed and educated people of America will  
represent a bolt of electricity passing through the heart of the  
country and reviving it. Without this the end game will be completed  
and America will remain forever cold and dead.

private funds?  you do mean, of course, the roads are being handed  
over to Cinta, the Spanish toll road company.  how are they going to  
pay for this?  you are, the driver, by making all interstates toll  
roads.  they're already doing this in the UK, most people are against  
it, but they're doing it anyway, just like they're going forward with  
this plan.  better do some research on your own rather than just  
discount it as paranoia, and yes, you can do something about it!  the  
united states is the only thing standing in the way of total world  
fascism.

and guess where i heard the port of entry going into the united  
states is?  kansas city.

the time to get hopping mad is now!  =]

Sure has with the whole skull and bones thing.

Wikipedia seems to have some info:

Bush is for open boarders, Iraq is a waste of time, people, and money,

Hi All....

Work is shipping me to Seattle this weekend... This will be my first
extended stay and I was hoping that one of you might have an idea of what is
going on up there....  or at least point me in the right direction...


Cheers...
Matthew

oh, i've been to mexico, where they have armed military on the toll  
roads and stop everyone to ask you for your papers and what you're  
doing there.  it's worse in other places like china for instance.

but it sounds like you have a defeatist attitude that no matter what  
we do we can't win.  that's not true.  we can win.

the banking system that directs about 95% of the nastiest of nasty  
stuff is owned by about 20 families.  the general population of just  
about any country outnumbers that.  the only thing that's holding us  
back is information.  the europeans voted down the acceleration of  
the EU and we can do the same, unless you're sure they won't put  
armed military on all the new toll roads asking for your papers.

make sure the people around you are aware of this stuff and let  
*them* decide if it's a quack conspiracy or not.

i've said about all i can say here.  i hope this encourages some of  
you to do actual research on your own!

It's getting worse here as well.  Look what Big Brother Sam is up to now,
and who's to say this isn't already happening to US Citizens?  See Excerpt
below, complete article at:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=VL4HVZGOUZETRQFIQMFCFFOAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2007/01/01/nusnoop01.xml

Bush administration plans further invasions of privacy for foreign visitors
to the U.S.

Britons flying to America could have their credit card and email accounts
inspected by the United States authorities following a deal struck by
Brussels and Washington.

By using a credit card to book a flight, passengers face having other
transactions on the card inspected by the American authorities. Providing an
email address to an airline could also lead to scrutiny of other messages
sent or received on that account.

The extent of the demands were disclosed in "undertakings" given by the US
Department of Homeland Security to the European Union and published by the
Department for Transport after a Freedom of Information request.

About four million Britons travel to America each year and the released
document shows that the US has demanded access to far more data than
previously realised.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: Sat.Jan.6 [KONTROL] w/ Daniel Bell & Matthew Dear LIVE!

Saturday, January 6th

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every first Saturday at the Endup


featuring from Berlin, Germany:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D>  DANIEL BELL aka DBX  <=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Accelerate . 7th City . Plus 8 . M-nus . Perlon

The master of minimal returns!  When Dan Bell takes
the decks, it's over. You will dance. No one can move a
dancefloor like this man. Everything there is to be said
has already been said. Just be there, and prepare for
one of the greatest nights out you've experienced in SF.


and from Ann Arbor, Michigan:

=3D=3D=3D> MATTHEW DEAR aka AUDION - LIVE! <=3D=3D=3D

Spectral Sound . Plus 8 . M-nus . Perlon

If you've heard Matthew's amazing DJ sets, you've only
heard half the story.  This month, alongside one of his
personal heroes, Mr. Dear will dip into his entire arsenal
of original material to rip SF a new one. Seriously, you
do not want to miss this one.  ...As if you would!


plus special guest from Winnipeg, Canada:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D>  S=DCZ  <=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Archipel . Unfoundsound . De'fchild

We always knew that S=FCz had great taste in music, but
recently we've discovered the girl can lay down some
tracks, too!  Her "Montreal Jones" mix was one of our
hands down favorites of 2005, and we are supremely
excited to showcase her talent at a proper SF getdown.


with resident DJs:

NIKOLA BAYTALA ( robsoul . junior boys own . s.w.a.t. )
CRAIG KUNA  ( concept sf . esdjco )
SAMMY D  ( classic . dirtybird . utensil )

BIO: DANIEL BELL

Born in Sacramento, California, Daniel Bell grew up outside of
Toronto, Canada, and then moved to Detroit where he collaborated with
Richie Hawtin as Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 Records. In
1991, he started his own label, Accelerate, on which he released his
influential releases as DBX. Based on nearby Chicago "track" records,
he reduced that sound further into funky, streamlined grooves. The
formula proved to be successful and helped launch a new aesthetic in
techno and house music known as "minimal".

With the overwhelming success of his "Losing Control" single in 1994,
Daniel set up 7th City Distribution in order to assist smaller Midwest
labels to get distribution in overseas markets. He also created three
new labels - 7th City, Elevate and Harmonie Park. In 2000, he
relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first mix CD, "The
Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell", on Tresor Records, followed in 2003
by "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!" He since has produced a series
of remixes for a diverse range of artists, includng John Tejada,
Pantytec, Akufen and John Thomas. He has spent the last 3 years
traveling and DJing around the world.

BIO: MATTHEW DEAR

You could throw around generous descriptors and any number of
genre-locking terms =96 minimal house, acid techno, electronic pop =96 but
you'd still fail to get to the center of Matthew Dear. With releases
under no fewer than three aliases, including False (M_NUS), Jabberjaw
(Perlon), and Audion (Spectral Sound), the Texas native has earned his
international status over the course of a decade, from getting his
bearings on the DJ decks as a teenager to flooring sold-out crowds at
venues like Fabric and releasing universally-praised original
recordings.

After meeting Ghostly founder Sam Valenti at a house party in the late
90s, Dear eventually produced the A-Side for the label's first 12"
release Hands Up for Detroit. Since becoming the flagship artist for
the dancefloor-oriented Spectral Sound offshoot, Dear has created the
albums Leave Luck to Heaven and Backstroke under his birth name, as
well as a series of singles and the Suckfish LP as Audion, all the
while building a reputation for some of the most evolved live
electronic sets ever crafted. He'll still tell you that his greatest
pleasure is a quiet day of fishing, but with plans for a new Audion
single (split with Ellen Allien, no less) and another full-length
under his proper name, it's clear that Dear has no intention of
slowing down anytime soon.

"well, i hate to be the one to say the bad news but i think all you guys
should know...

Wes Robinson has passed on! the man in his late 70's was found dead on
december 30th by one of his daughters early that morning, if you guys didnt
know Wes, he was one of the main managers at the venue known as the crack
house! He also was one of the main ppl to bring you the party "Fuck Da Dumb
Shit" witch went very well thanx to all that attended! All the proceeds will
be donated to his family for outstanding debts, cost of his funeral, ect...

Wes Robinson lived for music and will always be remembered for it. Wes was
not only involved in our scene but was multi involved in a number of
projects as well, we will miss you Wes and all that you have brought to the
table for our scene!


R.I.P. hommie, you will be missed! "

I got that news from my friend chris. I'm pretty sad about the whole thing.
I first worked with Wes in 1999 when I did a show called infinity. I then
went on to work with Wes on about 12 other shows. He is one of those people
that were always in the back drop of our scene, and was instrumental in
keeping it together. The crack house and Wes's memory will live in our
hearts and memory for as long as we are around.

Thank you Wes for everything you did, you are and were a good man. You will
not be forgot.

All the more reason we should pull out all support, money, supplies, and 
such from around the world.  Stop buying foreign goods, etc.  If they 
really want to import, start slapping HEAVY tariffs on everyone, and 
eliminate income tax domestically.

No...  that won't work either, because the general mentality is that the US 
is support to give free handouts to everyone just to get spat in the face 
as a thank you.

I still find it ironic how many people leave their countries just to come 
over here so they can get a job, medical care, free education, and such and 
protest us.

I can just hear the conversation back in Elbonia:  "Yes.  I will make the 
sactrifice, and leave our great country of mud, to go to the infernal 
united states, wher ethey have naked woen and running water, hot food and 
health care.  I will go there to live and infiltrate the system to try to 
make them as miserble as we are here in the homeland!"


Don't mind me...  I've been suffering from Norovirus for the past 33 hours.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

OK, so I'm glad people on the list are thinking about this stuff.  As  
is always the case with an open forum, the important thing is not  
that we all agree on everything, but the opinions are out there.  I  
don't have too much time today to devote to getting into the debate,  
though I'd like to, because I feel like some of you are starting to  
realize your unique value as an American citizen and having  
experienced the wonderful open-minded intellectual culture of San  
Francisco ravers.  Whether you realize it or not, you're a little bit  
above this false left-right liberal vs. conservative crap.  Remember  
that and hang on to it!

I'll leave you today with a thought, one of my temp jobs back in the  
90's I told this lady I go to raves, and her response was to ask me  
what kind of dance we do at them.  I was oblivious to what that  
meant, because I never went to school dances, in fact never got into  
dancing until I found raves in 1991.  The thought is, there is no  
right or wrong way to dance.  Just be yourself!

RIP Wes, you will be missed.

Wes Robinson has passed on! the man in his late 70's was found dead on
december 30th by one of his daughters early that morning, if you guys didnt
know Wes, he was one of the main managers at the venue known as the crack
house! He also was one of the main ppl to bring you the party "Fuck Da Dumb
Shit" witch went very well thanx to all that attended! All the proceeds will
be donated to his family for outstanding debts, cost of his funeral, ect...

Wes Robinson lived for music and will always be remembered for it. Wes was
not only involved in our scene but was multi involved in a number of
projects as well, we will miss you Wes and all that you have brought to the
table for our scene!


R.I.P. hommie, you will be missed! "

I got that news from my friend chris. I'm pretty sad about the whole thing.
I first worked with Wes in 1999 when I did a show called infinity. I then
went on to work with Wes on about 12 other shows. He is one of those people
that were always in the back drop of our scene, and was instrumental in
keeping it together. The crack house and Wes's memory will live in our
hearts and memory for as long as we are around.

Thank you Wes for everything you did, you are and were a good man. You will
not be forgot.

I heard that they also are hardcore Elbonistia fascists. They don't
believe in separation of church and state and find ALL human hair
sinful. If a baby is born with hair, that baby is evil and is to be
placed in the nearest McDonalds (sometimes they must travel as far as
5 blocks for this practice). That's right, they shave ALL body hair
daily. Peach fuzz is especially sinful and if found on their body by a
hard line jackbooted EE storm trooper they are forced to watch E!
television and pray to Tomcat. When they get into congress they will
only swear on the holy book of Elbow. This book contains various
teachings about Elbonian Mud Euphoria, use of the Ebow in music,
hairless Elephants, Elongated Eurethas (sic), proper hair removal
techniques (ball shaving kit included), and proper Elbonics.

Beware, Elbonians are coming, and they come hard and long.

I remember doing visuals at the Crackhouse for most of the COTS parties, 
(hi Kj!) I also remember doing a bunch of others there: Warmth, 
ASR, First Light, etc... :-)

Wes was cool, he'd let me mount projectors in his loft/live area. I 
remember helping Spencer(Warmth) soundproof the roof with carpeting (in 
mid-party after a sound-complaint). That was a nutty space, got busted *a 
lot*, yet would never die!

Wes put up with a lot of shit running that space, hope he's in a better

use a keyboard, guitar, microphone, etc. where you plug them into 
an interface and then  the interface plugs into your computer usb-port?

Also, what are the Easiest ones to use software wise. 

Which ones should I look for on ebay that have extremely easy to use
software that come with  them. 

I'm looking for extremely easy one's to use but also inexpensive. 

What names should I look for? 

thanks

They are called USB hubs and they all seem to work very well and
simple. Just go to your local store and buy a new one for $15. Don't
risk using an old one or used one for the cheap price of a new one.

i think you need something more like a midi controller + audio interface
like the M-audio Ozone
http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/MAudioOzone-main.html
or just a plain audio interface like The FireWire Solo
http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FireWireSolo-main.html
or the one i have a PreSonus Firebox http://www.presonus.com/firebox.html

It all depends on how many inputs/outputs you need or may want in the
future. and if midi IN/Out are important
If your on a tight budget M-audio has lots of solutions.
I personally think its very important to go with firewire instead of USB i
had lots of issues with usb

most bring bundled software as well. i personally think ableton live is the
most intuitive.

hope it helps.
any questions just ask.

USB hubs come powered by the port or with a seperate power supply.   
make sure for your application you're using one that has a power  
supply.  belkin is a good brand.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cheapest, easiest to use and best interfaces??

Okay so all I need is a hub????

Maybe I didn't ask the right question. I've never done this before but
the guy at  my local
music store said I should try to get something like a "tascam u.s. 122 
w/ cubase".  

The interfaces hub or  whatever it is called comes with the software in
the package.

He said these interfaces have about 2 plug ins so you can use two
instruments at once(if I wanted).

Software:
I NEED some type of virtual software 16-22 track studio on my computer
screen so that I can load 
up(record) whatever I play on my synth(through the interface or hub(or
whatever it's called). 

Does that make any sense to you guys?

I don't want anything fancy.
 
I just need to get started with this and I have no clue as to what I
should look for. 

But I want cheap prices and simplicity, and an easy software studio
program.

Ideally  I'd like to buy the package together but if  it  is smarter to
buy them
seperately, I guess I could. 

You guys are saying that I simply need a usb hub, correct?

Okay then I need to know what the cheapest and easiest to use software
studio  program is
that will go with the interface. 

thanks

hit me up on aim tonight at fingerprintaudio. The tascam is a piece of crap.
Go m-audio for the cheapness, but if you have money to spend, the digidesign
m-box solution is a good route.

Man.. so many memories of so many great parties thrown by several different crews back in the day, all made possible by Wes and that space. Simply legendary. God i miss those days.
   
  Whats up Terry =)

  I remember doing visuals at the Crackhouse for most of the COTS parties, 
(hi Kj!) I also remember doing a bunch of others there: Warmth, 
ASR, First Light, etc... :-)

Wes was cool, he'd let me mount projectors in his loft/live area. I 
remember helping Spencer(Warmth) soundproof the roof with carpeting (in 
mid-party after a sound-complaint). That was a nutty space, got busted *a 
lot*, yet would never die!

Wes put up with a lot of shit running that space, hope he's in a better 
place now :-(

He doesn't need a USB hub- he needs a "USB audio interface".

not sure what stance you are taking(no religion vs one religion vs all
religions) but it's a step to a more secular government...which i
desperately want. Being a christian(zomg, hide ur childrens), it disgusts me
the lengths at which MEN go to proclaim that GOD wills it so.

fucking assholes.

but yeah, that buddhist, total class act.

this is one definition of secular -

1 denoting attitudes, activities, or other things that have no  
religious or spiritual basis : secular buildings | secular moral  
theory. Contrasted with sacred

now, i thought we already had this.  it's written into something  
called the first amendment.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,  
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...

we have a guy running the country that views this iraq war as some  
kind of crusade that god (and probably pat robertson) told him to do,  
and issues signing statements to back his plan, if he even has one  
anymore ... i guess that's not secular.

I think the key point is that CONGRESS didn't state that God told them to 
go war.

Politicians have always been free to have their own beliefs, and even makes 
their descisions base don those beliefs.

1st ammendment is about laws specifically passed stateing what is the 
OFFICIAL religion or what religions are BANNED.  The only real time the 
siubject of banned comes up is for tax reasons, and they ae fully allowed 
by the constitution to discriminate on that level.  They arn't telling 
somebody that can't practice some religion they made up last week, but they 
certainly arn't going to get tax exempt status because of it.

Sorry, we already have over populated prisons.  We improsion a greater 
percentage than any other nation on earth.  Something needs to be 
done.  Decriminalize trivial shit or start cacking peopel that arn't 
getting out anyway.  Maybe make Prison less fun so people won't want to 
live there on my dime.

I donno.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Good news for today

first of all, i wanted to add what the article forgot to mention ...  
that is chocolate rations weren't cut as much as we expected so  
that's good news too!  <-- a little joke for anyone that's seen 1984.

second, i've seen links to this website before, commondreams.org, but  
i've never read many articles from them.  if what shatter says is  
true, though, then i would have to say this is one of those left  
"gatekeeper" sites, chilling words by the way, from someone that used  
to call himself a gatekeeper and had a whole formula on what one was.

but anyway, someone like noam chomsky is a perfect example of a left  
gatekeeper type.  a total bore in my book, but some of the hippie  
types seem to love him because he talks in that NPR speak.  but  
there's more.  saying we should just forget about 9/11.  even saying  
so what if 9/11 was an inside job and so what if the kennedy  
assassination was an inside job.  is noam chomsky really just a CIA  
controlled asset?

i would have to say if you find a wide variety of sources that say  
the same thing, and i don't mean you went to fox news, cnn, and npr  
and just because they all said the same thing means it's the truth.   
i mean real research.  that takes time.  then maybe it's credible.   
but data can be skewed any which way.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Good news for today

thesis?  what thesis?  are you writing one?  i'd love it if we can  
all read it about noam chomsky and jeff rense.

rense had a good guest on last night, webster tarpley, the man who  
wrote the unauthorized biography on george bush.  a 2 hour interview  
and no phone calls, because that's how jeff does his show.  and the  
other thing he does that i like is let his guests talk, instead of  
interjecting stuff like alex jones does, and usually jones has good  
information to interject, but tarpley is the kind of person who could  
go on for perhaps 4 hours and not run out of useful information.

so tell us how racist jeff rense is.  i really don't know much about  
him, except he has a weird hairdo and he likes to talk about UFO's a  
lot.  the wikipedia article suggests he's more anti-zionist than  
racist, but let's hear it.

i called into this show the other night.  you ought to consider  
listening one night, 4-7pm pacific time, go to GCN live's free  
listening page http://www.gcnlive.com/listenlive.htm and select feed  
#3.  it's really easy to get through i've already called in twice and  
you can talk about whatever the hell you want.

here's what they said the other night when i mentioned i use a water  
filter (much better than a brita, do some research if you have one of  
those pieces of junk in your fridge) for everything, including coffee.

Yea, I don't like the government water too much.

I think what's funny is if you tune into CNN/FOX they will run a story, 
then have to bring on "experts" to explain to you what you just saw.

anyone want to do this?????


http://www.beachimpeach.org/

Dear Friends,
On Saturday, January 6, 2007 (just two days after the new US Congress convenes), 1,200 people will gather for an impeachment event in Nancy Pelosi’s back yard — on Ocean Beach in San Francisco.

Early that morning, in 100-foot letters stretching 450 feet across the sand, volunteers from the Beach Impeach Project will outline the message:

I M P E A C H !

At 10:30, the attendees will arrive and lay their bodies down inside the message’s lettering. At 11 a.m. a helicopter will arrive overhead and photographers will record the 1,200 bodies in the sand — “IMPEACH!” — with the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.

News editors will have compelling photos for the next morning’s Sunday papers; the nation and world will have convincing evidence of how badly the American people (even Ms. Pelosi’s own constituency) want their leaders held accountable for the Iraq disaster; and the impeachment movement will have powerful visuals to go with the words and chatter swirling in the air for months and months.

Well, those words were what the current on air DJ just uttered on KZSU. You 
see, KZSU is celebrating it's 60th anniversary this year.  And right now we're 
in the midst of a 60 hour marathon commemorating that fact, playing songs from 
those 60 years during each of the 60 hours of the marathon.  And right now is 
1970.

So far, I've heard some great things!  And I don't want you to miss out, so go 
ahead and listen in yourself.  http://kzsulive.stanford.edu or 90.1 FM if 
you're in the SF Bay area.

I'll be hosting the 1985 portion of the show at 2a tonight.  So if you have any 
favorites that you'd like me to air, send those suggestions my way.

Enjoy!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Cheapest, easiest to use and best interfaces??


I 100% agree here -- at the very least, you need to
pick up a book or two on how to make electronic music
and go through all the steps first before you just
start buying gear and software that you have no idea
how to use.

There are so many different products out there and so
many different methods for accomplishing the tasks of
composing, recording, arranging, mastering, etc. that
it's impossible to point to a single, best solution --
the best solution for you will depend on many factors
related to hwo you work and what kinds of recordings
you're looking to make.

Many community colleges have classes in recording and
electronic music -- I think it would be a really wise
investment to go through some kind of course to
familiarize yourself with the process and products
available before you start throwing money at the
situation.

And one last point -- never *never* ask the guy at
Guitar Center/Sam Ash/etc. to tell you what to buy. 
They'll always find the most expensive solution they
can sell you because (duh!) the sales folks in those
stores work on commission!  They'll try to get you to
buy as much stuff as you can afford to buy, not the
best stuff for your needs.

Impeachable offense.... hmmm   I can think of more than just one offense
Bush Co. has committed.

Here are a few of them, but of course, the usual smoke and mirror tactics o=
f
deceit will be deployed (and already have been) to convince the public,
opponents, judges, etc, that the President has acted in  good faith in
abiding the constitution, Geneva conventions, US Law, etc.

NSA wiretapping of americans without warrants, ignoring the procedures of
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

The now famous Downing Street Memo, along with the testimony of former
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neil constitute direct evidence of a decision by
Bush to invade a sovereign foreign nation on entirely specious grounds.

Authorizing torture of POW's - a direct violation of the protocols of the
Geneva Convention

Holding so called "non-combatant civilians" for an indefinite period of tim=
e
,depriving them of their day in court ,acess to counsel, and acess to famil=
y
members who could plead their cause to the public.


I think I'm going to make it out to the beach, maybe head up to towards the
cliffhouse to get a better view to see if they can really pull this off.

Wasn't that also the stance (in the house) that was happening back 
during Nixon's time??

And, as far as offenses go, maybe lying about WMD in order to bring the 
US to go to war might be considered High Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
And the 2nd BIGGIE would be the Warrantless Wiretap program he initiated 
(and renewed multiple times.)

tribunal to face his crimes...we'll just give him a slap on the wrist,
they'll hang his ass.

Well, with all the salivating over Ford, here's a good article to sum up 
my opinion on THAT pardon, as well as the current impeachment concept:

Not to be arrogant but I probably know more about old style studio
recording "outside" the cpu realm then the
two of you combined.

I know all about the terms except the cpu soft. aspect. 

I own a dx7, emaxII, 8 track mini studio and effects unit.

thanks to the people that actually helped in private emails. 

fuck the rest

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Good news for today

you know, i've read the articles you posted and i haven't found *one*  
thing that convinces me that jeff rense is anything but anti-zionist  
for the reasons of basically holding grossly unchecked power over  
innocent Jewish and Israeli people.  in fact, from reading them, i've  
been able to determine that the term "anti-semetic" actually refers  
to a whole region of people in the middle east, so saying "anti- 
semetic" might be something more equivalent to saying you're against  
all people in the mid-atlantic region of the united states or against  
all orgeonians.  nothing to do with religion!

as far as noam chomsky is concerned, i've never heard him say or seen  
him write anything that makes me think he's a credible source for  
information or opinion on *any* subject; in fact, his recent comments  
about suggesting we shouldn't care that 9/11 was an inside job or the  
kennedy assassination was pretty much the same make me really suspect  
he's just a puppet of the new world order simply posing as a phony  
liberal; though i am not going to go around telling people they  
shouldn't listen to him.  go ahead, he's all over the internet,  
television, and national petroleum radio.  decide for yourself.   
certainly don't take my word for it.

anyway, i pulled some interesting quotes off these articles to share  
with everyone, and i especially like the first quote because it sums  
up what the banking system likes the most, and that is to keep  
countries constantly at war with each other so they can constantly  
profit off it, keep governments in perpetual debt, and keep you, the  
citizen, constantly paying for it through taxes and the biggest  
hidden tax called inflation.  if you haven't read G. Edward Griffin's  
Creature from Jekyll Island, I suggest you get yourself a copy, like  
YESTERDAY.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cheapest, easiest to use and best interfaces??

Well vs Mr Jackson I think that might be a stretch :)

Sorry for assuming otherwise- those of us on many music and gear  
lists see posts like yours all the time-
I thought you were just some dumb kid too-

I mean- it is kinda strange that you have a computer, and have synths  
etc- but you've *never* ever looked in to a midi interface for your  
computer?
Or used the soundcard on the computer?

I dunno- i find that a little weird-

Also- since you have no clue- do you really need to live multitrack?
All these audio interfaces do (in a very general sense) is provide a  
high-quality purpose-built soundcard- some providing things useful  
like multiple simultaneous inputs.
If you don't need live multitracking (you're just recording one part  
at a time) fuck it- just use the soundcard you've already got.

Get some software (Audacity is free) and you can arrange and effect  
all your tracks all you want.

Are you sure you want to make a claim like that, man??  Maybe you should ask
around sir.  I was raised on music.  I've played the drums since the age of
5.  Been Djing since 1986...and producing/mastering since 1994.  I run/ran 5
successful dance music labels from 1994-2002, and have more than 50+ release
under my belt.  

Are you sure??

Do you still wanna talk about it??  Or do you think you should maybe go take
your fucking class at the college and zip it?  BTW: I was just making a
suggestion.  I know a ton of folks who took classes at community colleges
and learned a ton.  Whatever.

Not to be arrogant but I probably know more about old style studio
recording "outside" the cpu realm then the
two of you combined.

I know all about the terms except the cpu soft. aspect. 

I own a dx7, emaxII, 8 track mini studio and effects unit.

thanks to the people that actually helped in private emails.

Are you sure you want to make a claim like that, man??  Maybe you should ask
around sir.  I was raised on music.  I've played the drums since the age of
5.  Been Djing since 1986...and producing/mastering since 1994.  I run/ran 5
successful dance music labels from 1994-2002, and have more than 50+ release
under my belt.  

Are you sure??

http://www.discogs.com/label/Particle+Music 
http://www.discogs.com/label/Refined

Do you still wanna talk about it??  Or do you think you should maybe go take
your fucking class at the college and zip it?  BTW: I was just making a
suggestion.  I know a ton of folks who took classes at community colleges
and learned a ton.  Whatever.

Saturday, January 6th

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every first Saturday at the Endup


featuring from Berlin, Germany:

Accelerate . 7th City . Plus 8 . M-nus . Perlon

The master of minimal returns!  When Dan Bell takes
the decks, it's over. You will dance. No one can move a
dancefloor like this man. Everything there is to be said
has already been said. Just be there, and prepare for
one of the greatest nights out you've experienced in SF.


and from Ann Arbor, Michigan:

=3D=3D=3D> MATTHEW DEAR aka AUDION - LIVE! <=3D=3D=3D

Spectral Sound . Plus 8 . M-nus . Perlon

If you've heard Matthew's amazing DJ sets, you've only
heard half the story.  This month, alongside one of his
personal heroes, Mr. Dear will dip into his entire arsenal
of original material to rip SF a new one. Seriously, you
do not want to miss this one.  ...As if you would!

We always knew that S=FCz had great taste in music, but
recently we've discovered the girl can lay down some
tracks, too!  Her "Montreal Jones" mix was one of our
hands down favorites of 2005, and we are supremely
excited to showcase her talent at a proper SF getdown.

BIO: DANIEL BELL

Born in Sacramento, California, Daniel Bell grew up outside of
Toronto, Canada, and then moved to Detroit where he collaborated with
Richie Hawtin as Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 Records. In
1991, he started his own label, Accelerate, on which he released his
influential releases as DBX. Based on nearby Chicago "track" records,
he reduced that sound further into funky, streamlined grooves. The
formula proved to be successful and helped launch a new aesthetic in
techno and house music known as "minimal".

With the overwhelming success of his "Losing Control" single in 1994,
Daniel set up 7th City Distribution in order to assist smaller Midwest
labels to get distribution in overseas markets. He also created three
new labels - 7th City, Elevate and Harmonie Park. In 2000, he
relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first mix CD, "The
Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell", on Tresor Records, followed in 2003
by "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!" He since has produced a series
of remixes for a diverse range of artists, includng John Tejada,
Pantytec, Akufen and John Thomas. He has spent the last 3 years
traveling and DJing around the world.

BIO: MATTHEW DEAR

You could throw around generous descriptors and any number of
genre-locking terms =96 minimal house, acid techno, electronic pop =96 but
you'd still fail to get to the center of Matthew Dear. With releases
under no fewer than three aliases, including False (M_NUS), Jabberjaw
(Perlon), and Audion (Spectral Sound), the Texas native has earned his
international status over the course of a decade, from getting his
bearings on the DJ decks as a teenager to flooring sold-out crowds at
venues like Fabric and releasing universally-praised original
recordings.

After meeting Ghostly founder Sam Valenti at a house party in the late
90s, Dear eventually produced the A-Side for the label's first 12"
release Hands Up for Detroit. Since becoming the flagship artist for
the dancefloor-oriented Spectral Sound offshoot, Dear has created the
albums Leave Luck to Heaven and Backstroke under his birth name, as
well as a series of singles and the Suckfish LP as Audion, all the
while building a reputation for some of the most evolved live
electronic sets ever crafted. He'll still tell you that his greatest
pleasure is a quiet day of fishing, but with plans for a new Audion
single (split with Ellen Allien, no less) and another full-length
under his proper name, it's clear that Dear has no intention of
slowing down anytime soon.

The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the 
spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that 
spectrum.

Um, dude, you just made a huge mistake. This list is full of producers
and DJ's that have tons of knowledge from the most obscure Russian
synths to musical theory masters. Some here have in fact work(ed) for
major musical equipment HW/SW manufacturers and helped create what you
own. Maybe you were the top dog in the studio in the 70's, but this is
the 21st century. Things have changed. If you ever want any digital
music help feel free to send me an e-mail or hit me up on AIM at
NSXFGC.

my personal bio (let me see how far I can pee...):
President of the midi club at Piedmont Hills HS. 92-94
De Anza college electronic music 101 & 102 94-95
Music theory Cal Poly SLO
Worked for Steinberg, M-Audio, Pinnacle Systems
Played in bands: The Fuzzy Green Carpets, Seriphin, Scissors for lefty

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Good news for today

well look, i don't think anyone's saying the holocaust didn't happen,  
and anyone that would come out and say that particular statement has  
a warped sense of reality because at very least the internment camps  
did happen.

so maybe we can agree to disagree on jeff rense, but i again strongly  
recommend you read that book, and read or expose yourself to webster  
tarpley, i think he really knows what he's talking about as far as  
governments being one "continuous creeping coup" to quote him.  just  
constant backstabbing, so really it's hard to discern what to  
believe, but it's our job as citizens to discuss these things and learn.

have a nice weekend

My point is are those IMPEACHABLE...

http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-318es.html

Would what you listed qualify for an indictment?

The best part to me is if you google for "impeachable offense" you see a=20
LOT of things about Barbara Boxer and impreach bush...

http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,977022-3,00.html

"Congresswoman Barbara Boxer had 143 bounced checks to account for. "

....  and she got re-elected.   To me bouncing checks is an indictable=20
crime, and therefore, impeachable.  Those in glass houses....

Anyway, impeachable offenses are generally major breaks of the=20
constitution.  Clintons case it was being a global embarissment for his=20
indescretions.

As for Bush's things...   well, we're ALL wire tapped.  All the time.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON

As for the enemy combatants...  IMHO...  They're not U.S. Citizens, I'm=20
tired of non citizens wanting constitutional protection.  I said it before=
=20
tounge and cheeck, but I meant it at heart.  Our right to protest is our=20
right, not a foreign nationals.  We certainly don't have the right to=20
protest in their country do we?  IMHO, everything from Foreign Lobbiests=20
down to foreign nationals staging prtest marches, needs to go.  Until they=
=20
want to commit to being a full fledged citizen with voting rights and pay=20
their tax gouges, here's a tall glass of STFU for them.

Another problem with U.S. is the mindset of teh criminal justice=20
system.  It's named this for a reason.  We arn't interested in the justice=
=20
for the victem, we are making sure a criminal get's justice.  I understand=
=20
the reasoning behind this, and I agree, but there's times it's taken WAY=20
too far by ultra libs and other cry babies.

Example:  you see a rape take place in an alley.  You know the women is=20
being raped because she's screaming "HELP I'M BEING RAPED".  The rapist is=
=20
still a "Suspect".  He's innocent.  What you saw means nothing until a=20
judge passes a sentence.  Refering to the Suspect in any other way can get=
=20
a mistrial.  If the evidence chain is somehow broken, mistrial.  If you as=
=20
a witness get found to have bad eyesight, have lied in the past, cheated on=
=20
taxes, missed  acar payment, or anything else, they guy could walk.  Is=20
this Justice?  The idea of being caught red handed doesn't apply.

Now, these are right granted to Americans.  I don't see any reason to=20
extend this to some foreign national who has a sole intent on killing us=20
out of general hated or being a religious zealot.

Ya....  i went off on a  tangent.  *shrug*

*sigh*

What does a military base in the middle of a desert need with some 20 tons 
of pesticide?  We've tried and convicted people for excess fertilizer (bomb 
precurser).  We've even arrested people for having too much baking soda 
(500 cases of arm & hammer) in South Central (pre curser to making crack).

WMD's is more than just a nuke.  Didn't CNN mention that to anyone?

Well since he got brought up...

What's interesting is the the more educated the country, the more likely it 
is to get subverted by a silver tounged flim flam.

Germany in the 30's wasn't some stupid 3rd world nation.  Yet he swooped 
in, convinced the masses, and rolled over poland.  Had germany been a moe 
simple people, of 8th grade educated types, chances are they would have 
simply lynched him.

Where am I going with this?   Oh....   I donno....

The problem with proving that Bush lied or pulled a fast one on the
whole US, Congress, England, me, and most of the American people about
WMDs is.... you can't prove his intent. He may have just made a
mistake, you know the same mistake the CIA, Clinton, UN, and everyone
else made that had access to the same intelligence. Is that
impeachable?

look, i appreciate your insights, it's just when we start getting  
into personal insults, this is starting to remind me of when there  
are televised debates between 9/11 truthers and bill o'reilly, where  
it just gets down to o'reilly shouting insults and no real discussion  
is going on, so i'm just going to leave this thread where it's at and  
let the free thinking people on the list decide what they think about  
all that's been discussed here.

Element Synchronicity<http://people.tribe.net/kestrachern/blog/8df226ce-1ed3-4809-b6ee-a526c63b1d3b>
Wow...
Aside from closing at 2am... Elements in Seattle is a fabulous club.
elementseattle.com/
Two separate rooms each having a dance floor about 25x25 cubby hole chill
spaces balcony and KICK ASS sound!
It is a small space.. but a great space... wait I was wrong.. the third
dance floor was closed off for tonight.. yikes..

Friday showcased Reid Speed www.reidspeed.com/ with opening set from Dig
dug... both playing sick breaks...
Reid played a DnB set in the other room but I was feeling the breaks.

The vibe on the breaks dance floor was different that the SF feel although I
am not sure exactly how.. but it still felt good.
Interestingly enough I came to find out that the only person that I danced
with turned out to be from SF and was in Seattle visiting family...

So my exploration of Seattle's nightlife is off to a good start... Saturday
looks good with three possibilities and Monday shows promise.... sadly
nothing yet on Sunday.... I may have no choice but to rest.... :P

Hope Friday in SF was at least as much fun

Subject: [sfraves] Fraggle Rock



"Dance your cares away, worries for another day
Let the music play, down in Fraggle Rock!"

I miss Fraggle Rock! Remember these hippie, acid
trippers? and the little green Doozers (twax) who were
always building something? and Sprocket the dog?  
Jim Henson was awesome. That reminds me of the
Labyrinth, also a great movie *sigh*

I wonder if there has ever been a 'fraggle rock' party
out there. makes me think of happy hardcore (eh) but
wouldve been cool.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: new dubstep laptop set

corrosion is the result of my experiments with dubstep and abandoning
vinyl altogether for ableton live.  I wanted to see how standard dj
techniques translated as well as how i could push the envelope with
more complex effects and routing at my disposal.  I was most worried
about losing the tactile experience of touching the vinyl - but I'm
pretty happy with the result (I can't wait to try it live.)  Hope you
enjoy.

i don't know but i can pretty much guarantee what would bring out a  
worse turn out, for "END THE FEDERAL RESERVE" because most Americans  
don't even know what that means!  and the funny thing is that is  
probably the biggest step to ending poverty.  haha!

Got a couple things going on.  For starters, most people thing the federal 
Reserve is actually owned by the government.  Second, most activists care 
more about about the activism than they do the cause.  They don't care what 
they're protesting as long as they get to protest.  The hypocracy astounds 
me as I can't imagine anyone beinga  more negative bitter person than that 
while at the same time self suffocating themselves on their smug self 
rightiousness.

"What do we want?  CHANGE!"
"What are we protesting?  WHO CARES!"

Cue circus music....

She is far from the only one in either house with such a record (this
doesn't make it ok!).  There was an article a few years back that covered
the amount of bankruptcies filed by senators/congress people, criminal
records, as well as charges brought against them.  Rather disturbing, but
then again, this is the best democracy money can buy, right?

And yes, many people suspect Bush is protected from a lot of information so
that it does make it harder to say he knew such and such after the facts ar=
e
laid out.  However, there are those like Cheney who are more than in the
loop with all of the intelligence info and what not.  Libby, Ashcroft and
Rummy out... why not go for him if they can't get bush?
Can't we get Colin Powell up on the stand against these gusy.....  : /

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

Ok, I have a question and would appreciate some good intelligent answers:

I was listening to conservative radio this morning on my way to work
(not Rush) and their point is that we should escalate the war and
fight it correctly in order to win. Their point is, we have to
increase troop strength, lower Iraqi freedoms, and stop playing the
good guy political correct army. Especially since we haven't won a war
since we stopped being brutal.

The other point is that if we leave:

1. Iraq collapses into a terrorist state (which would be a threat to the US)
2. Iran can overrun Iraq (Which is already somewhat happening since
Iran has been sending and funding terrorists in Iraq)
3. Iran can gain nuclear ability easier
4. The massive oil supply (money) of Iraq will be in the hands of terrorists.

so what is the best way to negate these arguments?

Also, another question, how is it that we were able to conquer Japan
and Germany in less time then Iraq and defeat the uprising (which
there was a lot of after the war) in those countries so easily?

Thanks for any thoughtful repies.

Steve:

IMHO, The best way to negate the points you illustrated below:

1) Let's call a spade a spade. Iraq is on the brink of a civil war, and half of the ING are spies/underground separatists aka Terrorists to those that oppose them (and get blown up by them). For all intents & purposes, it already is more of a terrorist state than it was before we entered. Not to say Saddam wasn't a brutal Tyrant, just telling it how it is. I sincerely subscribe to the notion that there will only be a political solution to this mess.

2) Iraq was the other "Super-Power" in that region before we invaded. Because vast resources were used on both sides of each nation while they were at war (and Cold War), this kept the president of Iran in check. Now that Saddam's out, this guy is now the shot-caller whether we like it or not. Even Iraq's president is co-conspiring with him now about what to do when we leave. Will Iran run amok all over North Iraq when we pull out? Doubt it, they've got bigger fish to fry. Like Europe & Sunni-based Saudi Arabia. 

3) No offense, but what a joke. We're talking about a country that already has these capabilities. Note Israel is technically still undeclared, as I bet Iran will remain for a long time unless they feel threatened. I think N. Korea will declare first if they have not already. 

4) What can I say? That point is well-taken. Let's leave before they do take control! Political solutions! Political solutions! Us being there is only attracting enrollment. As a matter of fact, I believe AQ is bigger now than ever.

To your second question: "Easily?" Don't think so buddy. You know better than to post a comment like that! Also, you need to read the 'Greatest Generation or watch Private Ryan. Don't play the easily won because we nuked 'em card; we had plenty of casualties esp. in Europe. There was nothing easy about it. 

peace

I was listening to conservative radio this morning on my way to work
(not Rush) and their point is that we should escalate the war and
fight it correctly in order to win. Their point is, we have to
increase troop strength, lower Iraqi freedoms, and stop playing the
good guy political correct army. Especially since we haven't won a war
since we stopped being brutal.

The other point is that if we leave:

1. Iraq collapses into a terrorist state (which would be a threat to the US)
2. Iran can overrun Iraq (Which is already somewhat happening since
Iran has been sending and funding terrorists in Iraq)
3. Iran can gain nuclear ability easier
4. The massive oil supply (money) of Iraq will be in the hands of terrorists.

so what is the best way to negate these arguments?

Also, another question, how is it that we were able to conquer Japan
and Germany in less time then Iraq and defeat the uprising (which
there was a lot of after the war) in those countries so easily?

Thanks for any thoughtful repies.

I believe troops on the ground are coming out in support of the idea of 
actually rebuilding the infrastructure and emplying Iraqi men in that 
task (I believe that this was also a pat of the recommendations made 
byb the Iraq Study Group.)  Seems like a win-win, but American 
corporations (Halliburton, The Carlyle Group, etc.) wouldn't be so awash 
in cash from their free-for-all looting as they are in the current 
scheme.

Thanks for the response. I really like your points about a political
solution and the fact that terrorist enrolment is probably up.

As for the the whole Japan/Germany issue, I wasn't referring to the
wars themselves (I'm well aware over 50 million people died in it, and
I can also name every aircraft that fought in it) I was referring to
how easily we transformed the countries after the war.

Thanks!

Hi Steve~

 From my perspective--having been a kid during WW II with relatives  
in both the European and Pacific Theatres of  War--there is NO simple  
answer except that we were still seen in Europe as liberators from  
Hitler's Nazi German empire and not as occupiers, and in Japan we had  
just dropped two A-bombs so they were in awe of our superiority. Thus  
we were overwhelmingly welcome in both Europe and Japan. Beyond that,  
of course, there's a lot more, but that IMO is a reasonable overview  
of  the main differences then and now.

Thanks for the good questions! I hope  you DO  get some thoughtful  
answers to  them!

Will

But there IS an important connection between the two: just as the  
situation in the Pacific Theatre of War was different from that in  
the European Theatre. The transformations were different as well:   
American occup[ation of a subservient people in Japan and in Europe  
the Marshall Plan to prevent the Soviets from taking over more  
countries there.

I can handle that one...

1. We had Nukes.  They didn't.
2.  Remember my statement about the overtaking of an educated nation vs non 
educated?  Cases in point.

ANyone willing to listen to reason is somebody that can be 
converted/brainwashed to your way of thinking.  Unreasonable people are the 
hardest to convert.  20 years of the Russian Afghan war taught us 
nothing.  Uneducated doesn't mean stupid.  What I mean are people who are 
not pre-occupied with thoughts about teh higher philisophiclal points of 
life, and have time to debate about this (all mailing lists online case in 
point).  They have to go work.  They work for food.  They farm, they 
irrigate, tend to flocks, etc.  Discussions are in the realm of did you eat 
today, was it good, how many sheep do you have.

These are the types of people that when you see a deadly snake, you kill 
it.  You don't worry about it's feelings, why it's there, what it's doing, 
what is it's food supply, what global climate changes could have caused it 
to leave it's normal enviorment, can it be reasoned with, maybe its' hungry 
and if i feed it it will go away.

Do you see where I'm going with this?  Kill the snake.

Thats' the mind set we're dealing with.  That's the problem I have when 
people say that "politics" will solve everything.  Remember that Politics 
is the science of being polite, and making everyone happy, saying things 
they want to hear.

If you want people to listen, you have to use a bigger hammer than the one 
they carry.  We have nothig that actually scares any of these people.  If 
we really want a political solution that would work we have two choices:

Army Corp of Enginners:  Rebuild the region with the iraqi people.  Teach 
them everything we can and make them self sufficient (What we did in 
Japan).  People are less likely to blow up something they build and put a 
lot of sweat into.  Doesn't mean it won't happen though.

Nuclear Threat:  Army corp builds some large tombs all over bagdad and we 
drop in some 100 megaton warheads into each one and seal them in.  All 
attacks are to cease or we level the region.  You have 24 hours to comply, 
then the talks can begin.  No compliance, we turn the entire place into a 
sheet of glass, and the remaining military that moved to a safe distance 
will take over all the oil fields and drain them dry. (Post WWII Germany 
Model).  Yes, this is extreme.  The world would not look favorably on us 
for this, but I doubt anyone would want to fuck with us either.

Since we're doing quotes...

"Just before World War I, there were a number of terrorist attacks on the 
United States forces in the Philippines by Islamic extremists. So General 
Pershing captured 50 terrorists, and had them tied to posts for execution. 
He then had his men bring in two pigs and slaughter them in front of the, 
now horrified, terrorists. Muslims detest pork, because they believe pigs 
are filthy animals. Some of them simply refuse to eat it, while others 
won't even touch pigs at all, nor any of their by-products. To them, eating 
or touching a pig, its meat, its blood, etc., is to be instantly barred 
from Paradise (and those virgins), and doomed to hell. The soldiers then 
soaked their bullets in the pigs' blood, and proceeded to execute 49 of the 
terrorists by firing squad. The soldiers then dug a big hole, dumped in the 
terrorist's bodies, and covered them in pig blood, entrails, etc. They let 
the 50th man go. And for the next 42 years, there was not a single Muslim 
extremist attack anywhere in the world. Maybe it is time for this segment 
of history to repeat itself, maybe in Iraq? The question is, where do we 
find another Black Jack Pershing?"

And the famous...

"Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of 
the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to 
drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or 
a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people 
can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you 
have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists 
for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger."

-- Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials

Easiest solution? Pull out of Iraq and accept whatever repercussions come 
with it like good little Americans.

No country is gonna be waging out and out war on the USA any time soon, as 
we'd cream just about anyone who came to our shores looking for a fight, but 
we had better get used to dealing with the occasional terrorist 
attack...it's to be expected when you consider how big of a superpower we 
are, and how much we've pissed off or pissed on othert nations around the 
world.

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR] [POL] Re: [sfraves] nrr: IMPEACH BUSH Beach Project



PBS's news program Frontline had a great episode on
recently titled "The Dark Side" which documents the
hows and whys of the deception that created and
reinforced the al quaeda/WMD story that was used to
wrest war powers from Congree so the US military could
invide Iraq.

You can watch the program for free on the Frontline
website:

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/

The thing of all this stuff is that there's no grey
area to it.  All of this has been done out in the open
and right under everyone's nose.  The problem is that
no one has the cajones to call the administration on
it.  The American people (that's you and me, folks)
are A-O-K with this kind of thing going on in our
name, so it doesn't get challenged.

Good point, sorry for the misunderstanding on my part. I would attribute our current rebuilding troubles to having absolutely NO PLAN going into this. From what I gather, we're also facing major resistance in our effort to rebuild (which can be attributed to an all-out lack of planning & resources on the infiltration side) from Sunnis & AQ trying to disrupt the current system & efforts. In the end, it comes down to horrible execution. Don't shoot! Just my .02

peace

As for the the whole Japan/Germany issue, I wasn't referring to the
wars themselves (I'm well aware over 50 million people died in it, and
I can also name every aircraft that fought in it) I was referring to
how easily we transformed the countries after the war.

Thanks!

Because vast resources were used on both sides of each nation while they were at war (and Cold War), this kept the president of Iran in check. Now that Saddam's out, this guy is now the shot-caller whether we like it or not. Even Iraq's president is co-conspiring with him now about what to do when we leave. Will Iran run amok all over North Iraq when we pull out? Doubt it, they've got bigger fish to fry. Like Europe & Sunni-based Saudi Arabia.

Sounds a bit simplistic in view, and I would guess you've visited theird

I believe there is some merit to this argument. Too bad Starchild isn't around anymore, for some reason I think he'd agree with you here. 

"Sorry about that, we're under new management now." Sounds horrible, but for better or worse it's a way forward (for the US at least, could be hell for others).

No country is gonna be waging out and out war on the USA any time soon, as 
we'd cream just about anyone who came to our shores looking for a fight, but 
we had better get used to dealing with the occasional terrorist 
attack...it's to be expected when you consider how big of a superpower we 
are, and how much we've pissed off or pissed on othert nations around the

Yes, it was simplified.  I don't assume my audience so I was writing 
towards general internet tech savy type of list reader.  Lists tend to 
hardly represent a good cultural cross section.  That's all.

Doubtful.  He was that type of guy.  We dealt with thing differently in the 
40's than we do now.  I just got finished watching all the disney WWII era 
propaganda cartoons, documentarys, and commisioned pieces that teh DoD 
bought.  VERY facinating to say the least. Remember our military leaders 
were the types that wouldn't hesitate to shoot a soldier on the battlefield 
for cowardice.

I've never said otherwise, however I'm not out in public making an ass of 
myself trying to disrupt the lives of everyone around me.  It would be one 
thing of the california congress directly voted against the peoples general 
wishes, but they don't, for the most part.  Our polititions are just as 
whiney and liberal as the statistical majority.

Case in point:  San Francisco stages a protest against something that the 
highly liberal city and state are already opposed to, with voteing records 
to back this up.

Bravo.  That's like throwing an anti-abortion rally at the RNC.  Way to 
open up the eyes and minds of the masses.

Try going somewhere where your feelings are agree'd upon by the 
public.  How about an anti-gun and war protest in Texas, or 
Georgia.  Anywhere in the deep south.  Go where there's a lot of voters and 
convince them.  No, that would be hard.

That's part of my point.  Its sorta en vogue to protest everything a round 
these parts.

i know i spend a lot of breath trying to get some of
you to come out to this or that party. well, jeremy,
you especially. but seriously, you've put together
quite the impressive collection of selectors for this
podcast, and i think, especially since this months
features some hot tracks from another of my favorite
hermits, that all my friends should hear it. and then
who knows? maybe others will join the campaign to get
you guys to come out and play with us. anyways, is
this the right link? if not, please correct me, cause,
well, i spend a lot of breath trying to get people to
come to great parties, should do the same for great
music as well, and would hate to lead them astray.

hey all -

i was out all day, here's what i did, i saw a lot of responses, i  
read them all, and i basically made one big reply, i didn't edit  
anything, and i tried to flag stuff that i haven't researched.  i'm  
trying to get some home organizing going on here, so wish me luck and  
i hope my comments add to the discussion but don't overwhelm people.   
have a good one.

I personally encourage getting information from whatever source you  
want, even Rush Limbaugh.  The problem many of us have is we don't  
get our information from *enough* sources.  I believe these studies  
that used to come out that suggested most Americans get their  
information from television news.  I remember I used to joke around  
years ago on this very list that I got all my news and information  
from ABC-7 news, which is owned by ABC, which is owned by Disney.

But when you think about it, how smart is it for anyone to get their  
news and information from an entertainment company?  That's like  
going to a used car dealer and asking them what they paid for the  
car.  Obviously they're going to do whatever they can to make sure  
they get the highest price at the highest interest rate from you, the  
consumer.  So it's up to you, the consumer, to make sure you're  
informed about the scams car dealers pull, just like it's your  
responsibility as a citizen to make sure you get your information  
from varying sources and use the brain that was given to you to  
figure out what you think is good and what you think is BS.

This war was not made to be won or lost, in my opinion, from what  
I've read, just like Vietnam wasn't.  It was made to keep perpetual  
war going on and on, for as long as they can, to keep the no-bid  
contracts going, to keep the oil in Iraq from flowing.  Right now,  
I'm reading Greg Palast's Armed Madhouse, where he outlines that the  
Bush Administration did not have 1 plan to invade Iraq before 9/11.   
In fact, he had 2 plans.  For those of you who don't know who he is,  
he is a BBC reporter that sometimes works for ABC News.  He was  
arrested a few months ago for filming a FEMA camp outside New Orleans  
that was next to an oil refinery.  He was charged under the PATRIOT  
ACT as a terrorist, but the government dropped the charges due to  
public outcry.

How many of you have heard that British soldiers were caught running  
around Iraq dressed up like Arabs with bombs and weapons in the back  
of whatever they were driving?  If this is true, what more would  
anyone need to come to the conclusion that perpetual war is the true  
goal?

By the way, did you know the United States has a ship called the USS  
Haliburton?  Welcome to the new America, where we do, indeed, pay  
constant homage to the corporation.

Now, back to these neocon talk show hosts.  Look, most of what is out  
there on the radio is just parroting the globalist agenda, in my  
opinion, but no matter what you're listening to, I would write down  
(or type in) supposed facts anyone spews out and verify it with your  
own research.  The problem, I think, in this country is most people  
don't read enough!  Read books!

Love that Herman Goering quote, by the way.  So true.

 From what I hear, we're being set up by people like Rupert Murdoch,  
who owns Fox News here and Sky TV in the UK, by demonizing the evil  
Americans invading a sovereign nation, and then here in America,  
telling us how great the war in Iraq is.  End result?  Everyone hates  
us, and we didn't even ask for this war.  At least I didn't  
personally call the White House and ask for us to invade Iraq and  
spend my money to do it.  Anyway, what does anyone think about this  
conspiracy theory?

By the way, where is Starchild?  I used to always hear people  
complain about getting their ear talked off about the Libertarian  
party.  A lot of these issues about bigger government and the  
encroaching police state, though, are I think Libertarian in nature,  
in my opinion.

Responding to Shatter's comment about military leaders being the  
types that wouldn't hesitate to shoot a soldier on the battlefield  
for cowardice.  One has to wonder what a definition of cowardice  
might be on today's battlefield, with the story of Jessica Lynch  
supposedly later coming out as staged, and the soldiers that didn't  
go along with the official version wind up dead, or the supposed  
controversy regarding Pat Tillmon's death.  What really happened  
there?  Apparently Kevin Tillmon, his brother, might be ready to talk  
about what he's learned.  Now I heard all this on the Alex Jones  
show, and I didn't research any of it, so go on the internet and  
research it before you go saying this as fact, or, conversely,  
calling me a nut.  What if it's true?

well, i think people should choose their liberty issues they want to  
focus on and narrow the beam.  some people might not even like  
demonstrating out in public.  it only took 1,000 people to make this  
picture.  not a lot of effort.  what i think would be a lot *more*  
effort would be to have a million people marching in washington, DC  
against the war, say, for instance.  possibly then, we might see  
progress.

There we go, I've been waiting for Deepfog to chime in all day (I love
his posts). Now my day is complete and I can go home and play legos
with my kid. Seriously.

Ok, so you think more along the conspiracy lines.... I personally
think that the conspiracy argument is probably about 30% true. For
instance: I'm sure Bush wanted to invade Iraq and I'm sure that
coorporations and oil helped his decision, but still there were some
decent reasons...

I always believed that Iraq was a major threat to the US and felt that
they were an immediate danger and thus attacking them was in our best
interest. Now, looking back I remember getting pissed off because all
Bush would say for reasons to go to war was " we are going to liberate
the people of Iraq from a repressive regime". For me, that is not a
reason to go to war, self defense is the only time violence is
acceptable.

Oh well...

Yeah, I also miss the libertarian posts.

Later,
Steve

Well - if the whole point was to displace Saddam and let the Iraqis run 
their own country...Saddam is DEAD, time to bail and let 'em do their thang.

Rather than put all the money we are to military presence, we could put the 
money (or at least a portion of it) towards helping them rebuild their 
infastructure - then we really would be helping!

That's what my suggestion about the army corp of engineers building and 
teaching at the same time to the people to rebuild their country.  Not just 
basic buildings but major changes, like aquaducts, water reclamations, 
recycling plants, whatever.  Bring them structurally into the 21st century 
without changing the culture, so to speak.  Enhance quality of living.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't heard of too many terrorists bombing 
other countries in protest of their running water.

I view conspiracies the same as paranoia.

Are you truely paranoid if people ARE out to get you?

Is the majority of the entire world commerce controlled by a small 
minority?  Yes.
Are the richest people in the united states on the wallmart BoD?  Yes.
Is there a Bilderbery Group?  Yes.
Do strange rituals happen in Bohemian Grove?  Yes.

Are all these things tied together?   Doubtful.  Interconnected, maybe, but 
the Grand Unification Theory is just as wacky of a conspiracy as anything else.

anti-war protests, I joined the war support ones.  Did I believe in 
it?  No, but I certainly didn't want to be seen with those assholes on the 
other side of the street.  ;)

My political views are weird.  I still think Iraq was a huge mistake and 
was opposed to us going in.  OTOH now that we're there, we have to finish 
it correctly, with some sort of end game strategy.  Of course we got into 
Iraq without finishing Afghanistan.  Funny how nobody mentions the war 
there anymore, even though it ages on.  Six years and counting.

I like guns.  I think we should all have them.

I'm mostly anti-abortion and pro capital punishment.  How could I be 
anti-abortion???  It's simple.  There's a lot of fucking BC on the 
market.  People will give it to you for FREE.  Condoms are everywhere.  For 
fucks sake, how in the hell can any get knocked up these days?  Abortion is 
not proper birth control.  Are there times when it's needed?  Yes, I just 
think it's too readily available.  Not that I'm saying no, but if they're 
going to make me wait 15 days to buy a gun, then they should make women 
wait 15 days to kill fetus.  My buying a gun doesn't mean something is 
guarentee'd to die, but an abortion certainly does guarentee it.  Also, 
second trimester abortions...  wrong...  performing them on 6mo 
pregnancies...  wrong.   So wrong...

I also think piss tests for Gov't assistance should be manditory.  People 
have to get a piss test for a job, it's only fair that those on the dole 
should have to get off their ass and meet them half way.

So...   am I still preaching to the choir?

Btw, that was a Chomsky quote, not mine.  If that's who you meant by SFR

me that he's lurking.  I hear he's really into booty-tech.

A thread on the lighter side for today. . . 

I don't care if we're talking live PA or pre-recorded DAT "show," what are your favorite(s)?

My top 3:
1) Chemical Brothers
2) Daft Punk
3) Cirrus

I think the problem with guys like Chomsky is that commentators and 
editorialists are treated as credible news sources.  They'll editorialize 
on some subject, and people will treat it as a news article, instead of 
what it really is, an opinion.

If a mandatory UA was intalled for all federal employees, you should already
have an idea what would happen.

UA's are demanded of GW Bush and his cabinet
Bush claims executive authority to deny going through with the testing
citing the test is a matter of national security  : P

A lot would fail.  I think it should be random testing too.  Put their 
money where their mouth is (err, or where their .... is)  But they don't

ATR was bad ass.  They played with Shizuo and Ec8or.  Nice hardore kinda
show.  Shizuo was alright and Ec8or was better, but ATR fucking rocked it.
Man that chick is hot.

It was a super small show too, there was like maybe 50 people in the
audience, and so they pretty much let us all up on stage, and my friend
almost stomped on Alec Empires face cause he dropped to the floor screaming
during one of the songs and with everyone moshing up on stage my buddy got
pushed back and noticed just in time to move his foot out of the way, and
helped Alec back up.  My ears rang for days after that concert...hehehehe.

I was there.  ;)

Crazy show was Orbital/Crystal Method/Chemical Brother @ The Bill Graham.

Orbital when they played at Live 105's Green Xmas Ball '96 was a killer 
show.  They were supposed to do a 25 minute set I think.   90 minutes 
later.....   :D

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: What are the best *shows you've seen?

Too many to really list...

The ones I really remember was a string of about 5 tour stops I followed 
Primus around during Pork Soda tour,
Mr Bungle. Every time I see them. The 1999/2000 show at the Galleria 
with Melvins and Fantomas. At midnight, when the whole place thought Y2K 
was gonna destroy life as we knew it, at the drop of the balloons and 
confetti they mr bungle comes out on stage and started their set to 
"what the world needs now.... is love, sweet love". And goes immediately 
from that song to some super heavy shit. Cathartic.
Strapping Young Lad
Pigface when they'd have like 25 people on stage at once.
Idiot Flesh and now Sleepytime Gorilla Museum...
Roni Size at the Maritime.
Frontline Assembly at the Maritime.
Einsturzende Neubauten.
Tool, San Jose.
Babyland whenever they'd play, sometimes in the desert. Thirteen years 
have gone by and I still catch them when they come up to the Gilman.
I never got really into seeing electronic acts live mostly because you'd 
see this fantastic group on stage but in a concert environment and you'd 
really want to dance your ass off but everyone else would be too dumb to 
get into it. It just never felt the same as the way I'd imagine it in my 
head.

And what I am really certain of is that I'm going to go to Lamb of God, 
Machine Head, and Gojira for my birthday in Santa Cruz in Feb. Hell yeah.

<http://laughingsquid.com/john-law-sues-his-former-burning-man-partners/>John Law Sues His Former Burning Man Partners

posted by <http://laughingsquid.com/scott-beale/>Scott Beale on January 9th, 2007 

<http://johnlawspeaks.wordpress.com>John Law, one of the original three owners of the <http://burningman.com/>Burning Man event, contacted me to let me know that he is just filed suit against his two Burning Man partners <http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/people/1_harvey_bio.html>Larry Harvey and Michael Mikel, after Michael initiated his own legal proceedings and demand for arbitration. In 1997 Paper Man LLC was formed between the three original owners in order to own and control the name and service mark “Burning Man”, which is at the center of this dispute.

Here’s a <http://johnlawspeaks.wordpress.com/2007/01/09/does-burning-man-belong-to-everyone/>statement from John Law regarding this lawsuit from his blog, which he recently launched in order to have a public voice regarding this issue.

Here’s a <http://laughingsquid.com/other/john_law_burning_man_complaint.pdf>PDF of John Law’s complaint that was filed in San Francisco on January 9th, 2007.

Full Disclosure: John Law is one of Laughing Squid’s business partners and a close personal friend, but that relationship is independent of his legal involvement in Burning Man. I met John in 1995 through the <http://cacophony.org/>San Francisco Cacophony Society and in 1999 he was involved in the formation of Laughing Squid LLC (Laughing Squid’s current business structure) along our third partner David Klass. I am a big supporter of the Burning Man event, which I attended for 8 straight years (1995-2002) and I plan on returning again in the future. The bottom line is that I am staying neutral on this issue. I’m good friends with the three people involved and hope they find a amicable resolution to this situation.

"An adult is one who has lost the grace, the freshness, the innocence of the child, who is no longer capable of feeling pure joy, who makes everything complicated, who spreads suffering everywhere, who is afraid of being happy, and who, because it is easier to bear, has gone back to sleep.  The wise man is a happy child."

I'm guessing one of these times was the last time they were here last 
year.  I could have sworn they were lip syncing about 85% of the 
time.

Loved their show at Otherworld.

I am a huge Melvins fan so I have been to several shows. I think my favorite show with them (one of many) was when the opened for GWAR. 

The Jesus Lizard was always an amazing live show.

DEVO was also extremely memorable.

Pink Floyd was the show I had been waiting for my entire life and they did not disappoint.

Goldfrapp was a recent show I saw and that was awesome.

And last but far from least and probably my favorite band only second to the Melvins is Jucifer. They are constantly on tour and their live shows are an experience. A guitarist and drummer and a wall of speakers behind them. The sound can only be described as huge.

Subject: [sfraves] HAIGHT STREET FAIR NEEDS YOUR HELP

So a lil' background info on HSF & the current situation we're dealing
with... Haight Street Fair has been going on now for the past 29 years...
Pablo Heising started this fair as a cummunity celebration in SF... as
time went on & years passed, the HSF has shaped up to be an event which
people, Globally, have attended & participate in every year! For a City
known for it's diversity, HSF has also been a landmark for the Culture &
celebration SF is known for!

I've been really lucky to be part of such a Dope organization! After being
part of San Fancisco Late Night Coalition for 4-5 years, I was so totally
honored when i became part of the Haight Street Fair organization. I've
been assistant stage manager now for the Groundscore/ Masonic Stage for
the past 2 years & Loving it! A few weeks ago, we had a meeting in the
Haight to discuss what was happening w/ the HSF & City Hall. Apparently,
there have been complaints from other organizations to City Hall & now
City Hall has the impression that all Hell breaks loose the day of HSF.

Now in SF, there are currently 5 HUGE annual day time events that happen:
Folsum Street Fair, How Weird Fair, Castro Street Fair, Love Fest
(formerly known as Love Parade), & Haight Street Fair. So compared to
those other day parties, those other community organizations are calling
us out & saying that our day party is out of control! LoL  !!! OK... so
let's see... there's two major gay/ alternative lifestyle fairs, 1 of them
focused on leather, which are known Globally and thousands of people
attend them year after year. Then there's another fair that involves
between 10-20 floats with DJs performing in a parade down Market Street
ending in Civic Center where 5000 people plus gather & dance all day. So
compared to all these events, City Hall & those other organizations
decided that HSF was too crazy for The City.

Unfortunately, Pablo passed away recently. One of the last things he said
during that last meeting was he wanted to be the ringleader for one more
fair, on a good round number, 30, before he officially singed off as the
head executive coordinator for HSF and passed down the golden keys. It's
really sad that he won't be able to do that. But Pablo had this dream. He
dreamed that we would be able to pass down this SF tradition so that
future generations will be able to enjoy the fair. I swear man, if you
heard the passion in his voice when he emphasized passing down the HSF to
future generations, you probably would of been as touched as i was! But
all hope is lost and we do have faith!! With a good team of HSF Board Of
Director & a community of support, it will happen!

Now here's where you come in. Because of this recent fight with City hall
& those other organizations, we need to prove that Haight Street Fair is
more than just another day party. There's strength in numbers &
signitures! Over the past few weeks, I know I've spoken to many of you
about this & Thank you for your support, but now I'm asking everyone to
PLEASE take some time to download, sign this petition, & mail it in! You
can find it here:

http://haightstreetfair.org/index.php

There's a huge meeting coming up in a few weeks at City Hall where the
future of HSF will be discussed. The organizations opposing HSF will be
present as well as a handfull of us who are fighting to keep it alive. By
you signing this petition & mailing it in shows that your pressence will
be at that meeting also. If you've ever been to the Haight Street Fair,
then you know how special it is. I mean, if SF can repesent various
countercultures in their own day celebrations, then we should be able to
have our celebration too! I mean serioulsy, like Haight Street is historic
for the artists, music, literary authors, and just the rich Culture SF is
known for! HSF is a reflection of that History. PLease help keep Pablo's
memory & the Haight Street Fair Alive!!!

Thank You!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: What are the best *shows you've seen?

OK, this list of shows will tell you just how damn old I really am.  Not re=
ally in any order:=0A=0A1. Bob Marley at Santa Cruz Civic during his last U=
S tour.  My girlfriend dumped me that week and the girl I took to the conce=
rt wasn't really into the whole smoke giant spliffs and dance till you can'=
t feel your legs thing.  But Marley's spiritual presence, ecstatic dancing,=
 and the herb carried the day.  I think this is the best single concert or =
musical event of any sort I have ever been to.=0A=0A2. Lynyrd Skynyrd at Da=
y on the Green.  The last tour before their plane crashed.  And we were up =
in front with a fifth of Jack.  Peter Frampton closed this show and he suck=
ed ass.=0A=0A3. Led Zeppelin at Day on the Green.  Their last US tour.  OK,=
 everyone says this concert sort of sucked but I was so excited to see them=
 and in truth I don't remember anything about the concert at all.  So it mu=
st have been good!=0A=0A4. Robin Trower and Grateful Dead at Winterland.  T=
hese were three different concerts, but back in the day almost any concert =
at Winterland was great.  What a great venue.  My favorite part was steppin=
g over the passed out people and junkies on the way to the bathroom.  Sweet=
!=0A=0A5. Oingo Boingo at the College V Cafeteria 1979.  This was the famou=
s College V/Porter Halloween bash.  I was dressed as a droog from Clockwork=
 Orange if I recall correctly.  =0A=0A6.  The Tubes at Bimbo's 365 and late=
r at the Berkeley Community Theater, The Bimbo's cncert was the very first =
concert I ever went to and they had their complete stage show.  Their prese=
ntation of the song "Don't Touch Me There" rocked my world.  The later Comm=
unity Theater concert defined my high school years.  =0A=0A7. Buddy Guy and=
 Junior Wells at some bar in Orange County. I drove almost two hours in the=
 pouring rain  from North Hollywood to see these guys and it was totally wo=
rth it.  Check out the record "Drinking TNT and Smoking Dynamite" where Cha=
rlie Watts and that other guy from the Stones back them up.  This is exactl=
y what they sounded like that night.  So friggin tight!=0A=0A8. The Marsali=
s brothers with Art Blakey at the Kumbwaa Jazz Center in SC.  They totally =
blew this tiny venue apart.  Wow.=0A=0A9. King Crimson at the Greek.  Twice=
.  Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew making strange guitar noises. My brain mak=
ing strange connections and correlations.=0A=0A10. Derrick May and Kevin Sa=
underson on 4 decks at "Red" during the Winter Music Conference.  Saunderso=
n came out and danced with the crowd between mixes.  Crazy funky techno.  I=
 discover the virtues of Red Bull and Vodka.=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A

Yeah a few years back i saw them at DNA lounge, and there were only like 3
of them on stage, Groovy, Buzz and some dude with dreds on drums.  It looks
like groovy was using the mic stand to hold himself up and you know i think
it did look like he was lip synching.  Very disappointing.  Saw them a
couple years later open for Ministry.  Much better that time, not as great
as before but at least they had Levi and others on stage and he was actually
rocking out on stage and not just standing there.

Oh man i totally forgot to add GWAR to my list, that show kicked ass.  I was
stained blue for a week after that show, had to go into a job interview a
couple days later and my hair and finger nails were still a slight shade of
blue.

Saw Roger Waters at Shoreline too about 5 or 6 years ago.  That was an
awesome show, no pink floyd, but about as close as you can get these days.

i saw gwar, once, when i was 17...i still kick myself for not having seen
them since.

oh, also, clutch, at ziggys in winston salem, NC...was a 3 hour show, the
bar stayed open past last call and it was more a house party than a club
show. Best time i think i ever had in the late 90's.

Heh you're making me want to dig out my GWAR 'before' and 'after' photos
that my friends and I took the last time we saw them, during the Tour de
Scum tour. Ummm, wait, I'm not that old, let's pretend it was the Mock the
Vote tour.

   Best story yet!!!

stained blue for a week after that show, had to go into a job interview a
couple days later and my hair and finger nails were still a slight shade of
blue.

Saw Roger Waters at Shoreline too about 5 or 6 years ago.  That was an
awesome show, no pink floyd, but about as close as you can get these days.

Portrait of Dr. Albert Hofmann


Swiss Albert Hofmann is reputed to be one of the most important chemists of our times. He is the discoverer of LSD, which he considers, up to this very day, as both a "wonder drug" and a "problem child". In addition he did pioneering work as a researcher of other psychoactive substances as well as active agents of important medicinal plants and mushrooms. Under the spell of the mind-expanding potential of LSD the scientist turned increasingly into a philosopher of nature and a visionary critical of contemporary culture.

    On 11 January 1906 Albert Hofmann was born in the quiet small town of Baden, Switzerland, as the eldest one of four children. His father is a toolmaker in a factory where he meets Albert’s mother-to-be; when he falls seriously ill, Albert has to support the family. That’s why he makes a commercial apprenticeship. At the same time he swots up on Latin and other languages, since he wants to take his A-levels, which he succeeds in at a private school (paid for by a godfather).

"An adult is one who has lost the grace, the freshness, the innocence of the child, who is no longer capable of feeling pure joy, who makes everything complicated, who spreads suffering everywhere, who is afraid of being happy, and who, because it is easier to bear, has gone back to sleep.  The wise man is a happy child."

Man, if we get into non-EDM type shows, I could go on for DAYS....I still 
have a stack of concert ticket stubs numbering in the 100's, and those are 
just ones that survived my many moves since '94....

You bet.  And the older you get the longer the list.  For example I saw people like Janice Joplin and the Sex Pistols live.  Was at Woodstock I.

The most consistently wonderful shows/parties I've attended, tho,  were the Grateful Dead events.  

My life has been one long quest for ecstatic experience.  Getting out of the self and joining the one.  I've been lucky.  Blessed.  For I've had more of these opportunities than I deserve.  The Dead were a source of tribal reunion for decades for me and many others.  Genuine family, transcending age, race, social station  and beliefs, in search of the one and helping each other achieve it.  Like the Paradise Garage and raving though, unfortunately, raves and the Garage didn't last as long as one would have liked :-)

The wise man is a happy child."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: What are the best *shows you've seen?

I was asked by the Melvins road manager to roadie for them in '99...I turned 
it down like an asshole. It's one of the few things I truly regret.

All because I was staying loyal to the band I was in at the time, who 
subsequently disbanded and stole a rack of my belongings about a month after 
I was asked.

Yay.

 list...<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The ones I really remember was a string of about 5 tour stops I followed <br>&gt;Primus around during Pork Soda tour,<br>&gt;Mr Bungle. Every time I see them. The 1999/2000 show at the Galleria with <br>&gt;Melvins and Fantomas. At midnight, when the whole place thought Y2K was <br>&gt;gonna destroy life as we knew it, at the drop of the balloons and confetti <br>&gt;they mr bungle comes out on stage and started their set to "what the world <br>&gt;needs now.... is love, sweet love". And goes immediately from that song to <br>&gt;some super heavy shit. Cathartic.<br>&gt;Strapping Young Lad<br>&gt;Pigface when they'd have like 25 people on stage at once.<br>&gt;Idiot Flesh and now Sleepytime Gorilla Museum...<br>&gt;Roni Size at the Maritime.<br>&gt;Frontline Assembly at the Maritime.<br>&gt;Einsturzende Neubauten.<br>&gt;Tool, San Jose.<br>&gt;Babyland whenever they'd play, sometimes in the desert. Thirteen years have <br>&gt;gone by and I still
 catch them when they come up to the Gilman.<br>&gt;I never got really into seeing electronic acts live mostly because you'd <br>&gt;see this fantastic group on stage but in a concert environment and you'd <br>&gt;really want to dance your ass off but everyone else would be too dumb to <br>&gt;get into it. It just never felt the same as the way I'd imagine it in my <br>&gt;head.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And what I am really certain of is that I'm going to go to Lamb of God, <br>&gt;Machine Head, and Gojira for my birthday in Santa Cruz in Feb.

Think that's pretty self-explanatory. I'll start with the giant blow-up penis the Beastie Boys first toured with. I say leave Burning Man out of this as that deserves a thread of it's own!

They had a 40' tall inflatable Little Green Man (from Toy Story) at Dune 
in 1998 (LA desert party). It was on the cover of Lotus magazine. That was 
neato.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: What are the best *shows you've seen?

old memory:  the who's final concert tour.

recent memory:  rush, death cab for cutie.

this was all before i got indoctrinated into the CIA and the Council  
on Foreign Relations.  i didn't tell my constituents back at home  
that when i ran for reelection ... <snip from Dick Cheney, minus the  
CIA>

of course, i've been to many raves but i can't quite remember any of  
the names of the really good dj's or live acts i saw at this time.  i  
tend to steer away from what everyone else says is the best, and i  
know, that means i probably miss a lot of good stuff, but hey then i  
probably wouldn't have as much time to watch every episode of star  
trek 5 times over.  what the heck?  eh?

Does the Gravitron ride and other canival type attractions at Cyberfest count?

Pretty damn cool getting to rid ethe thing for 15 minutes without needing 
to buy crappy carnival tickets.

Artificial gravity when you're tripping out and pounding techno 
music...   AW YEA!!!!

non a prop per se, but my girlfriend told me about some rave in LA
that had something to do with butterflies and the promoters not being
entomologists.

to quote her: "everywhere we stepped there was a dead butterfly".

much fun.

Yeah I was there too, that was defnitely a Gravitron. Crazy party.

AFAIK, that Cyberfest was pretty much the last time in the bay area a 
promoter actually came through with real "carnival & amusement rides" at 
a rave, and not an inflatable slide & buckin' bronco instead.

Yeah, Cyberfest has definitely had its ups and downs, but certainly garnished some great memories for most of us at one party or another. My fav. was still '99 in San Jose. '98 at Homebase/Int. Rave Center was pretty good too.

I remember at some fair or something that i went to when i was a kid in
Oregon they had an orbitron and the guy operating it was spinning some kid
around in it and he went to push on one of the rings to make it spin faster
and his hand slipped and got caught inbetween the inner and outer ring and
snapped it.  He yanked his arm out and ran off through the crowd screaming.

When i volunteered at the OMSI (oregon museum of science and industry) we
had an orbitron there.  That was always fun after hours just riding in that
thing for hours at a time.

Gravitron is cool.

Back in the early nineties my company did some work for MCI with a VR system 
that included an Orbitron (Not Gravitron) and I met the inventor of the 
thing.  He was a sick little monkey.  Stay away.

BTW what ever happened with Cool World?  Are these guys doing parties still?

I did some work with Mike Manion back when I was at Live365, but I haven't 
heard from any of these guys for a few years now.

Might be bc I was broke for a lot of that time ;)

Regards,

Peter

Yeah, Cyberfest has definitely had its ups and downs, but certainly 
garnished some great memories for most of us at one party or another. My 
fav. was still '99 in San Jose. '98 at Homebase/Int. Rave Center was pretty 
good too.

AFAIK, that Cyberfest was pretty much the last time in the bay area a
promoter actually came through with real "carnival & amusement rides" at
a rave, and not an inflatable slide & buckin' bronco instead.

I remember my first ride on a Gravatron in the late 80's. Imagine
being 12 years old and walking into this dark closed spaceship looking
thing with loud speed metal (DRI?) playing inside and spinning up to
speed watching the teenagers smoking pot and making out in the middle.
Although I loved it, I thought the ride was pure evil and I was on my
way to hell. For sure I was once I got busted for walking on the walls
by some dude that knows why crank is called crank.

Can you imagine the liability insurance for that stuff now a days?

That right there is most likely the limiting factor.

I remember that thing.  That was basically a sensory override system that

I rememeber some VR movie type of things I tried out in Tahoe way back.

good, i was only a few ft from him =D

Hey, how are you doing?  My name's Tony  'Krash'.  I'm a 23 year old breaks 
DJ from New Orleans.  I've been  going to raves since late 98, going from a lot 
of the warehouse and skate park  parties to most of the 'Disco Donnie' State 
Palace parties. I've been  DJ'ing Lousiana and the Mississippi coast since 01 
for both club and  underground venues.  Those were good times.  The rave scene 
was  incredible for a while.  However, it seems that even the best venues  
and promoters down here have sizzled.  It's kind of sad,  actually.  I love this 
scene and the music and the people so  much!  There used to be a party pretty 
much every weekend.   Granted, I think hurricane Katrina had a big part to 
play in all of this, but I  still miss going to good shows.  All of the shows 
have been moved to the  club scene, which just defeats the purpose for me.  I 
see raving and  clubbing as two different entities.  The last big party I've 
been to was a  Caffeine show last summer, but from the looks of it, I don't think 
that venue is  viable anymore.   
    Ok, this hurricane thing has humbled me in many  ways, but I'm still 
looking for a good show.  I have a sister in San Fran  who has invited me to come 
down.  I've heard that there was a thriving  scene down there.  I would like 
to come visit up there and if I'm  incredibly lucky, I'd like to go to a nice 
show or an underground party.   Do you guys have any suggestions on any good 
shows or production  companies?  Have all of the raves moved to clubs like it 
has down  here?  Even the upcoming Mardi Gras 'Zoolu' party held down here in  
New Orleans is being moved to a club this year.  I feel that the rave scene  
may in fact be pretty close to dead down here, so my ambition is to maybe find a 
 scene someone else, like so many others have come down to New Orleans to do 
just  that in the past.  
    How is the scene in SF?  Is there any party  that I can't or shouldn't 
miss?  How's the underground?  Any  feedback would be awesome!  Much love, -Tony

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Robert Anton Wilson dies

As many of you know from previous quotes of the day, Bob Wilson is  
one of my all time favorite authors.  I've always appreciated his  
witty sense of humor and if you ever want a good run down on what was  
going on in this country in the late 60's to the early 80's his  
Cosmic Trigger books are a good source.  I went to his blog site  
today, which now I'm sort of sorry I didn't go to more often, and I  
decided to post his final 2 entries, the January 6th entry really  
made me cry for a minute, ironic because he was making a funny.   
Anyway, I encourage you to visit his blog and read up.

Do Not Go Gently Into That Good Night

Various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting I  
have between two days and two months to live. I think they are  
guessing. I remain cheerful and unimpressed. I look forward without  
dogmatic optimism but without dread. I love you all and I deeply  
implore you to keep the lasagna flying.

Please pardon my levity, I don't see how to take death seriously. It  
seems absurd.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DIRTY w/ Future Funk Squad, Fine Cut Bodies, Lobudg, Ambient Mafia - Jan. 20th

Evil Breaks presents:
DIRTY
January 20th, 2007
Fat City (old Studio Z space) - 314 11th St @ Folsom
presales: limited $10/then $15 - available soon
door: $15 b4 11pm/$20 after
10pm - 4am
21+


I don't think this lineup really needs much introduction. 4 world
class headliners, a great huge space with 2 rooms, 1 of which is
hosted by the amazing Ambient Mafia, and Viberations doing the visuals
for us once again. Viberation has done visuals for us quite a few
times for us in the past and was responsible for our room @ Love
Infusion as well as the last show we did @ Studio Z with Uberzone Live
& Carbon Community Live. You know we'll have the place decked out
propa with lighting, visuals, and sound. And the Ambient Mafia will
have there room made to relax with tons of their own decorations,
lighting, and visuals. We might even have a nice little table set up
with some snacks and fruit for all of you.

IMHO, this is by far the best lineup you guys have had in a long 
time...MAJOR kudos on that!

I highly suggest any of you kids who haven't been out to an EB event in a 
while, or just plain need you some proper choonage w/ a breath of fresh air 
- GO TO THIS ONE!!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: DIRTY w/ Future Funk Squad, Fine Cut Bodies, Lobudg, Ambient Mafia - Jan. 20th

Future Funk Squad has had some really excellent singles released from
his full length album and the Fine Cut Bodies sound i think will be
well received in SF by both breaks heads and minimal techno folks.

Lobudg are our homeys and well always welcom Bil and Dave.

should be a proper night of music and dancing!

My guess is that they found out, the hard way, that when you  
consistently promote talent that you don't actually have at the  
party; and lie, to the tune of a three-hour 150-mile drive, about  
where they are; people eventually stop going.

Heh... that was the first and last time *I* ever tried going to a  
cyberfest, myself; and the only time I've ever wasted money on tix to  
anything coolworld.  I've never believed another word to spew forth  
from anyone or anything coolworld-related, since.  And it even turned  
me off to the very idea of massives for a long time; until someone  
finally convinced me that, for all the crap they get on SFRaves, what  
Skills puts on their flyers if the truth.

I just wish I hadn't been so new to the city and the scene at the  
time (I'd yet even to subscribe to SFRaves...), so I'd have known  
someone more clued in than me to warn me off about the coolworld  
peoples' lying and shady nature.  I'd have started going to Skills  
parties sooner.

(Make fun of me if you want.  I do actually have a soft spot for  
cheezy trance massives once in a while.)

john

BT fucking killed it that night.  then Oakenfold went on and i left
before his first track was finished and ran over to check out Carl
Cox.

i danced my ass off to Aphrodite that night, too.  yes, i <3 the jump up.

and the room was packed for Oakenfold.  i was at the front for BT and
it must have taken me 10-15 minutes to get out of that room.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mighty, next Friday

>From Murph:

Some unfortunate news just came in from London today. It turns out
that the Christmas and New Year holidays have postponed the processing
of the Drumattic Twins visas by 2 weeks so that it won't be ready
until January 26th. As a result, they will be unable to play with us
at Mighty on the 19th.

We were really looking forward to having the Twins here for their SF
debut and are actively working to re-schedule them for later in the
year.

While we are bummed that they can't make it this month, the event is
still cause for celebration as it is the 2 year Anniversary for Mighty
Breaks. Mighty Breaks has established itself at the core of the SF
breaks scene and we will be celebrating with all the crews that have
helped to build the scene.

Line Up: Murphstar, Mancub, Melyss, Aaron Pope, Aaron Jae, Syd Gris,
J9, Shissla, Lud Dub, Antonio, MoPo and Mike Giannini

We are dropping the pre-sale price to $5 and the door price to $10.
The Drumattics are putting together a custom hour long mix CD for
exclusively for us that we will hand out to the first 100 people
through the door at Mighty Breaks.

Please spread the word about the change in line up, the reduced price
and the limited CD's for the first 100 people through the door.

Also, Any DJ who has ever played a Mighty Breaks gets in FREE before Midnight!

Pre-Sales are available here.
http://tinyurl.com/y6fad7

I am sorry for all of you who were eager to see the Twins, but fear
not as we are locking in a date over the next few months. We will make
it up to you and then some.

Hope to see you all out on the 19th!

My favorite hacks are modifying the SEEMs to enable the video
recording function and turn up the maximum loudness.  The rest you've

Subject: [sfraves] KZSU radio informational meeting

If you ever had an urge to get involved in radio, your chance is coming 
up soon.  Tues. the 16th to be specific.  That's because we're having 
our quarterly informational meeting for KZSU.  So if you want to train 
to be a DJ, or sportscaster, or newscaster, or talk show host, or if you 
want to work in promotions, publicity, public affairs, etc., now's the 
time.

You don't have to be a stanford student to get involved even.

The meeting is Tues, as I mentioned, at 7 pm in Memorial Hall, Room 125.

Web flyer is here:

I heard this lady being interviewed on Jeff Rense the other night, it  
was a rebroadcast.  I would call her a right wing patriot.  She's  
definitely pro-gun, anti-illegal alien because her daughter was in a  
car accident with one that was uninsured, and well she's got a whole  
list of articles on her website.  I think she's a riot to listen to,  
though.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: New mix to download

Meant to get this out last night, but fell asleep while the file was in 
process of uploading.

So, I was at the Open Mind sale snatching up vinyl last night (Wed.) and 
I ended up bringing the loot to the station today (thur.)  As can be the 
case, there was a fairly wide mixture of styles.  So I ended up 
arranging things into sub genre groups and decided to press record and 
start mixing.  What came out was an interesting mix covering house, 
electro, breaks, progressive, techno, acid, and a spattering of trance 
sub genres.  And other than trimming the empty space from the beginning 
and the end of the recording, no further processing has been done.

Check it out for yourself here:
http://www.mediafire.com/?andujjjd1ni

And leave me your thoughts on it if you feel inclined.

Thanks, and enjoy!

Maybe the definition of a "superstar" DJ is just changing...either way, this 
I agree with totally:



"So I say good riddance to the 'superstar' DJs, and hello to DJs that know 
how to and are interested in keeping the party rocking."

hi,

now that i'm officially making public blunders on sfraves, i might as well ask for what i really want. do any of you have good photos of the cloudfactory tent? i can't locate any useful pics of that structure on their website and i'm trying to talk some of my friends into purchasing something similar. a visual aid would really be helpful as i make my case. thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer!

love,
mo

BT fucking killed it that night.  then Oakenfold went on and i left
before his first track was finished and ran over to check out Carl
Cox.

i danced my ass off to Aphrodite that night, too.  yes, i <3 the jump up.

and the room was packed for Oakenfold.  i was at the front for BT and
it must have taken me 10-15 minutes to get out of that room.

I heard of this place (I think it's in the city) where they play trance 
music every Wednesday. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the place, but 
my housemate and I really want to check it out. Have you heard of 
anything like this or know what it's called?

I heard of this place (I think it's in the city) where they play trance 
music every Wednesday. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the place, but 
my housemate and I really want to check it out. Have you heard of

The Twilight Years of Cap'n Crunch
Silicon Valley legend John Draper made his name with brains and  
pranks, before slipping to the margins
Three jail stints and the 'rave' scene
By CHRIS RHOADS
January 13, 2007; Page A1

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Underneath a highway bisecting this Silicon  
Valley town, home to Google Inc. and other tech giants, John Draper  
crammed his bulky frame through the door of a friend's home: a  
battered 1978 Chevy diesel bus.

Radio parts, a wrench set, arthritis medication and a book on  
robotics cluttered the dashboard. A padded bench for sleeping and a  
greasy stove filled the back.

"What do you want for lunch?" asked Dave Bengel, a self-taught engineer.

"Salmon," responded Mr. Draper, 63, who has few teeth and wears the  
same clothes for days. He is better known in Silicon Valley as "Cap'n  
Crunch," a legendary figure who 25 years ago epitomized the  
freewheeling, prank-filled culture that gave birth to high tech.

"Salmon, all right!" cried Mr. Bengel. He set about preparing the  
meal -- obtained free from a Whole Foods worker who leaves outdated  
products near a dumpster at a prearranged time.

In the decades since Mr. Draper gained fame for his hacking skills as  
a "phone phreak" -- he once claimed to have gotten then-President  
Nixon on the phone -- Silicon Valley has aged and matured. Pioneers  
that Mr. Draper worked with, such as Apple's Steve Jobs, have gone on  
to become wealthy members of the business establishment.

THEN THERE is "Cap'n Crunch," part of an aging community of high-tech  
wunderkinds. Once tolerated, even embraced, for his eccentricities,  
Mr. Draper now lives on the margins of this affluent world, still  
striving to carve out a role in the business mainstream.

Although his appearance and hand-to-mouth existence belie it, Mr.  
Draper developed one of the first word-processing programs as well as  
the technology that made possible voice-activated telephone menus. He  
receives invitations to speak to foreign governments and  
international conferences. At a recent celebration of Apple Inc.'s  
30th anniversary, Mr. Draper, sporting a straggly beard, stood to  
contribute a story, causing the room to break into applause.

Mr. Draper spent three stints in jail in the 1970s for tampering with  
the phone system. A court-appointed psychiatrist once found him to be  
"psychotic," although another found nothing wrong with him. Until a  
fall at a conference in Istanbul aggravated a back injury, Mr. Draper  
was a regular in the rave scene, where people gather in remote  
locations and dance through the night to electronic music. Mr. Draper  
once did $10,000 worth of Web-site design and other computer work for  
a Bay-area therapist in return for physical therapy on his back  
because he lacks health insurance.

"When I first met him, he was toothless, wearing ripped jeans and  
looked like a hippie," says Tolga Katas, a music producer and  
computer programmer in Las Vegas who recently hired Mr. Draper to do  
technical work for his new Web entertainment company. "Then I learned  
what he has done and was blown away."

Mr. Draper calls aging veterans like himself part of an "off-the- 
grid" community. Steve Inness, 47, helped develop touch-screen  
cellphone technology and does programming work for startups. In  
recent years, he's lived on the floors and couches of employers; he  
was last seen hitchhiking in the desert outside Las Vegas. Roy  
Kaylor, 68, built one of the first electric cars in the early 1970s  
and contributed to a government-supported effort to develop the  
technology. He lives in a trailer without electricity in the Santa  
Cruz mountains. Mr. Draper's recent lunch host, Mr. Bengel, 61,  
designed an electrohydraulic machine tool and says he has worked for  
several Silicon Valley companies.

Mr. Draper is the best known. "He was the king of the nerds," says  
Allan Lundell, who runs an independent film company and has  
chronicled the evolution of Silicon Valley.

Mr. Draper's father was a U.S. Air Force engineer and the family  
moved frequently. His younger brother, Ron, recalls John rummaging  
for electronic parts on military bases where the family lived, on one  
occasion building a radio station in his bedroom.

John was not an easy child, often bucking under the authority of his  
sometimes-distant father, who is now deceased. John threw tantrums  
when his parents smoked, says Ron, a piano teacher. Mr. Draper says  
he hated his parents' smoking and felt aggrieved by their refusal to  
stop.

"Our father didn't understand what John needed, which was a constant  
supply of education and resources," says Ron. "He absorbed this stuff  
like a sponge." Ron Draper says his parents briefly sought  
psychiatric treatment for his brother when he was a child for what  
they said was a "chemical imbalance.

"I liked the sessions," says Mr. Draper of the psychiatric  
counseling. "At least someone was listening to me." He acknowledges  
he can become obsessive but denies the idea there's anything wrong  
with him.

In 1964, after taking some college courses, Mr. Draper joined the Air  
Force, which his parents thought would provide much-needed  
discipline. He was sent to Alaska and later Maine, where he served as  
a radar technician. Since the soldiers had only one phone line on  
which to call home, Mr. Draper began tinkering with the access codes  
and figured out how to make free calls through the local switchboard.

After an honorable discharge in 1968, he built gear for several  
companies in the San Francisco Bay area. But his work, much of which  
was military-related, was out of step with the counterculture  
blooming around him. Mr. Draper grew his hair and began spending more  
time on a pirate radio station, which he operated from the back of  
his green Volkswagen van to make it harder for authorities to track  
the signal. He also turned his attention to the phone system, an  
attraction for like-minded techies before the arrival of personal  
computers.

Mr. Draper learned how to make free calls by imitating the tones used  
by the phone company. He learned from other "phone phreaks" -- as the  
hackers called themselves -- including blind teenagers with near- 
perfect pitch. Mr. Draper learned that a toy whistle found in a  
cereal box would also imitate the required tones, earning him the  
nickname Cap'n Crunch.

The point was not just to make free calls but to explore and learn  
from the phone company's rich and complicated system. On one  
occasion, Mr. Draper says he learned the code word needed to speak  
with the president -- "Olympus" -- and got through to someone on a  
secure line he thought was President Nixon. Mr. Draper says he told  
the man about a toilet-paper shortage in Los Angeles.

Authorities began to take notice, particularly after a lengthy  
article on phone phreaking appeared in the October 1971 edition of  
Esquire magazine. Mr. Draper, the group's ringleader, was arrested  
for the first time several months later on charges of wire fraud, and  
received a five-year probation.

The Esquire article also caught the attention of Steve Wozniak, an  
eventual Apple co-founder, who invited Mr. Draper to his dorm room at  
the University of California at Berkeley. When Mr. Draper appeared  
that evening, Mr. Wozniak, then 21, was taken aback by his guest's  
appearance and odor, Mr. Wozniak wrote in his recent autobiography.

"Are you Cap'n Crunch?" Mr. Wozniak asked in disbelief, according to  
the book.

"I am he," Mr. Draper responded as he strode into the room.

Mr. Draper showed Mr. Wozniak and a friend, Mr. Jobs, how to build a  
device that could produce telephone tones. The pair turned the  
knowledge into a small business on the Berkeley campus, their first  
collaboration before founding Apple a few years later.

Mr. Wozniak employed Mr. Draper at Apple, where as a contractor in  
1977 he designed a device that could immediately identify phone  
signals and lines -- such as ones that made free calls -- something  
modems were not able to do for a decade. The technology would later  
be used for tone-activated calling menus, voice mail and other purposes.

APPLE DROPPED the device, called a phone board, anxious to avoid  
negative publicity from its association with illegal phoning,  
according to former Apple employees. "It was a great board and others  
at Apple didn't recognize that," says Mr. Wozniak. Mr. Draper became  
closer to Mr. Wozniak than to Mr. Jobs, who sometimes felt  
uncomfortable around Mr. Draper, former Apple employees recall.

"John was a little strange and Jobs felt better staying away from  
him," says Mr. Wozniak, who has remained in touch with Mr. Draper  
over the years. Mr. Jobs in an email declines to comment.

Just as the computer revolution was about to begin, Mr. Draper's  
legal problems steered him away from the action. He was sentenced to  
prison for phone fraud in 1976 and again in 1978, and says he was  
attacked during that second stint by an inmate with a baseball bat,  
permanently damaging his back.

The next year -- after his third bust for phone fraud -- he was  
berated for his behavior. "You have to pay for your long-distance  
phone calls," a San Jose U.S. District Court judge told Mr. Draper at  
his sentencing, according to an account in the San Francisco  
Chronicle. "Is that a very difficult moral concept to grasp?"

Mr. Draper's lawyer replied: "His entire reality has to do with the  
technology of computers and telephones. When he gets involved with  
the technology aspect, he loses all sense of morality."

TWO COURT-APPOINTED psychiatrists examined Mr. Draper. One concluded  
he had an "underdeveloped sense of people" and was "psychotic"; the  
other found nothing wrong with him, according to the Chronicle article.

In 1979, while serving a sentence of a year of nights in the Alameda  
County jail -- it was later reduced to a few months -- Mr. Draper  
wrote the EasyWriter word-processing program. At night he wrote code  
in longhand, diligently preparing for the next day when he could  
spend time in the offices of a software company he founded with friends.

Mr. Draper received permission from the sheriff's office to attend a  
computer fair in 1979 in San Francisco, where the program, named  
after the cult film "Easy Rider," was a hit. It became Apple's first  
word-processing program. When IBM launched its first PC, it also  
chose EasyWriter, over competition from other programmers, including  
a young Bill Gates.

Mr. Draper bought a Mercedes and a home in Hawaii. But the company he  
founded, Cap'n Software Inc., earned less than $1 million in revenue  
over a six-year period, according to Mr. Draper and Matthew McIntosh,  
who ran operations. The real winner was Bill Baker, who handled  
EasyWriter's distribution and marketing through his own company.  
Without Mr. Draper's knowledge, Mr. Baker hired his own programmers  
to create EasyWriter II just as Cap'n Software was publishing  
EasyWriter 1.1.

Cap'n Software sued and the matter was settled in court with Mr.  
Baker paying the pair an undisclosed amount. Mr. Baker, now an  
Internet entrepreneur in Corona del Mar, Calif., says his version of  
EasyWriter was for the higher-end corporate market and didn't  
conflict with Mr. Draper's, although he acknowledges the possibility  
for confusion.

Mr. Baker says he helped Mr. Draper get a start in business. "There  
are people who see themselves as victims no matter how much money or  
how many opportunities you give them," says Mr. Baker, who sold his  
distribution company in 1983 for $10 million.

Mr. Draper worked for several years in the late 1980s for Autodesk  
Inc., a San Rafael, Calif., company that makes design software. He  
was laid off along with others when new management arrived. It would  
be his last corporate job.

Through the 1990s, the story was the same. Mr. Draper was qualified  
for any number of openings, but some companies didn't want to hire  
someone with a criminal record while others remained wary of his  
eccentricities. Promising opportunities with Apple and NASA came and  
went, he says.

As Silicon Valley was taking flight again, this time with the  
Internet boom, Mr. Draper turned to the rave scene. He traveled as  
far as Australia and India, where he got by for months at a time  
earning money designing Web sites and writing computer code.

Mr. Draper several years ago developed some Internet-security  
equipment and started a company. Some clients were interested, but  
the company foundered when one of its executives, a fellow raver,  
made off with much of the money from investors, say Mr. Draper and  
another executive, John Johnson.

Mr. Johnson is still trying to make a go of the product, with Mr.  
Draper's help. Mr. Johnson's dilemma is whether to use Mr. Draper's  
name -- or hide it. "Some companies say we don't want any contact  
with that guy," says Mr. Johnson, who says he's in advanced  
discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense about the product.  
The Pentagon declines to comment.

Mr. Katas, who recently hired Mr. Draper to work for his online  
entertainment company, en2go.com, recently arranged to have Mr.  
Draper meet a software executive in Beverly Hills as a possible  
source for more work. Before the meeting, Mr. Katas emailed the  
executive about the "legendary John Draper," listing his achievements.

Mr. Draper, who was included in the email, replied to the executive  
and Mr. Katas that he had no money for parking and doubted that his  
car would make the trip across town.

"John just doesn't understand that if he seems unsuccessful, then  
successful people won't understand how talented he really is," says  
Christine Marie. Ms. Marie does promotional work for Mr. Katas and  
helps Mr. Draper organize his business life, handling invitations to  
speak at conferences and an online TV show he produces that deals  
with Internet security. She also occasionally cleans up his apartment  
and washes his clothes.

Mr. Draper's friends from the EasyWriter days worry that time is  
running out. Work is getting harder to find now that tech companies  
are outsourcing programming work to inexpensive labor markets overseas.

Contemporaries who've gone on to riches and fame say they've tried to  
help Mr. Draper over the years. Mr. Wozniak, who now invests in high- 
tech companies and is involved in computer education in schools,  
recently gave Mr. Draper a new Apple Powerbook computer. He has also  
helped out with Mr. Draper's legal bills.

Mr. Wozniak says Mr. Draper's problem is that his skills lie in  
technology rather in making business deals or starting a company. "He  
didn't come from a business orientation," says Mr. Wozniak.

Mr. Draper's unusual behavior, such as shouting at anyone smoking  
anywhere near him, could wear on fellow workers and employers. "He  
was not a self-starter, or associated with all the companies  
springing up back then," says Mr. Wozniak. "But, actually, John is  
one of the happiest guys I know, no matter what his situation seems."

ON A RECENT MORNING at a Bob's Big Boy restaurant in Burbank, Calif.,  
where he goes when he has enough money, Mr. Draper ordered his usual  
breakfast: eggs and bacon first, to be followed five to seven minutes  
later by grilled pancakes loaded with butter and syrup.

The first course arrived. "The bacon's too greasy, I can't accept  
these," he shouted at the waiter. Mr. Draper sends back his bacon  
about 70% of the time. He says that since he has no opposing teeth,  
the bacon needs to be crisp enough to break off in his mouth. He lost  
most of his teeth from infrequent dental care, which he blames on his  
lack of health insurance.

After breakfast, Mr. Draper returned to his one-room apartment beside  
a four-lane expressway. The apartment was in squalor, with open  
cereal boxes, clothes in trash bags, computers and old newspapers  
strewn about. Mr. Draper left an angry voice message for a client who  
hadn't paid for some programming work. He fretted that without the  
money he would have difficulty covering his electricity bill that month.

"I'm blacklisted, man, a permanent menace to society, I guess," he  
said. "It's too bad because there are some things I think I could  
contribute."

Thanks for all of your input on the matter.  I  agree with most of the views 
that you guys have presented on the 'progression'  of the rave scene.  It is 
safe to say that it is not just going on in the  west coast, but in the south 
as well.  The club scene does feel like it has  turned 'thuggish', and this is 
coming from a guy that grew up in the proverbial  'hood'.  Even the whole 
experience of seeing the most appealing and  cutting-edge DJs like Donald Glaude 
and George Acostas have been, to me,  undermined by the fact that they have 
moved to more mainstream clubs with people  that are there for something to do 
rather then people that really do like (I  LOVE) the music and the people.  
    I definitely have seen the scene change since  2001.  That's a very 
specific year where the scene definitely went  through some drastic changes.  I 
remember in July-August of 2001 I was on  my way to the next Caffiene party who 
included one of my all-time favorite funky  breaks DJ, Baby Anne.  I was so 
excited to go.  I remember that wen I  got there, however, the whole place was 
swarming with police.  That was the  first time I've seen one of the parties 
really get raided.  Ever since  then, things haven't been the same.  The rules 
and  regulations set age limits and prohibited such paraphanelia as glow sticks, 
 etc.  
    I have to say, however, that I don't mind so much  about the age 
regulations.  At least now they can serve alcohol, which  is good and bad.  I started 
raving when I was fourteen and I have been  listening to the music since I was 
born, but now that I look at the bigger  picture, I guess the age limit isn't 
too bad of a thing.  What bothers me  is the attitude and vibe of the whole 
thing.  I think the culture  got lost somewhere among the popularity contests 
and  people misinterpreting the music (again).  
    I do have to acknowledge the comment on the vibe in  Europe.  I was 
fortunate enough to go to Paris last Mardi Gras to visit my  then girlfriend who 
was studying abroad.  We went to a few clubs, including  Club Rex and Vinyl, and 
the vibe was amazing, and even more so because of the  fact that I was in 
another country so I really felt like I was in tune with  the world in some ways. 
 The experience was amazing.  Now I can't  say the same about French people 
in general, but hey, a raver's a raver.   =)  
    I also had similar experience when I took a detour  to Amsterdam.  The 
club scene was vibrant and I wish I could describe it in  words in an e-mail.  I 
wish I could smoke a cigarette with you and  tell you about it.  Then we can 
get nostalgic about rave culture circa  2001.   
    I have yet to experience Ibiza but hope to in the  future.  I hope that 
it doesn't turn out to be some overrated tourist  trap.  Any feedback would be 
awesome.    
The last real rave that I have been to was in 2006 during the summer.   It 
was the last Caffiene party that was down here in New Orleans.  I  believe that 
is going to be the last real rave that is going to be in New  Orleans.  I've 
been to every one since 99, so it's kind of  disheartening.  
    However, I can say that thanks to promoter Disco  Donnie, I have seen 
almost every DJ that I have ever wanted to see and  more.  He was an amazing 
promoter and I guess I got kind of spoiled because  he threw the best parties =) . 
 If anybody is reading this and gets bored,  I found a little link about him 
and the scene here.  Pretty much every  raver in New Orleans knows this like 
common knowledge, so check it out.

(http://www.bestofneworleans.com/dispatch/2004-02-03/cover_story.html) 
 
   As for my trip that I am planning for San  Fran, I really appreciate the 
feedback.  I will indeed look into the Love  Parade.  I have heard bits and 
pieces about it over the years, but I never  really looked into it.  I am also 
strongly leaning towards Burning  Man.  I hope it hasn't gotten tainted by 
commercialism yet.  I still,  however, want to go to SF before the summer, but I'm 
not sure if its viable as  far as my raving ambition goes.  Please prove me 
wrong =) .  Ok,  thanks again, drop me a line -Tony 'Krash'

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: What are the best *shows you've seen?


Yarr, while there's a funny stigma about having seen many shows, I'll 
vouch here.  Dead shows were for *years* the torch burning where it didn't 
burn elsewhere.  I feel honestly fortunate to have caught the dead before 
the parking lots got totally neutered, and probably caught at least 50 
shows before my 18th birthday.  It's a big part of why I've always been at 
least hesitant to pass judgement on the youngest members of our 
community... I was an early starter in a parallel universe for sure.

Fave shows that I can think of:
Grateful Dead at one of a string of Inglewood, CA shows at the GW Forum.  
I think it was a 4 or 5 night run, and in the middle of it the drummers 
brought on Olatunji with some guests (memory was hazy but it was three 
large women doing percussion chanting and harmony stuff)and it was fucking 
insane.  I danced straight through that, just really fucking lost it in 
The Good Way [tm] for the first time in my life.  Extra points on my 
friend (a skinny persian kid who loved the music) with a memorable 
performance, we'd made a bag of trails mix 
(normal trail mix + a couple shredded up irie brownies that had been 
"dropped" and a half oz of mushrooms)... and halfway through the show I 
realized he'd eaten almost the entire bag to his head, was almost 
catatonic for a bit and went on to remove most of his clothing and run 
down the aisles with lit sparklers coming out of his pants screaming 
"we're all fucked!".  Scary, sure, but also strangely awesome.

King Crimson at the Greek (berkeley, ca):
Yeah, ok, it's a prog rock staple... but seeing the first tour of the 
"dual trio" setup of KC was amazing for everybody in the crowd.  Seeing a 
blob of aging virtuoso players have that much fun and degrade into spastic 
noise, smoothly venturing into ambient, then into songs from the early 
Discipline stuff was just nuts, and the crowd was so into it.  A 
California Guitar Trio show later that same year had similar energy, good 
stuff.

Weezer @ the Cactus Club (san jose, ca):
They were already has beens, and we were waiting for them to finish so we 
could throw our weekly (Killa Subs I think it was by then) but they were 
REALLY FUCKING GOOD.  Total surprise how awesome they were.

Revolting Cocks @ ? (los angeles, ca):
Don't remember the venue, but OMFG, what a show.  It was for the Beers 
Steers and Queers tour, this show ate any other industrial-ish show I've 
ever seen for lunch... not too reliant on drum machines or samples, just 
SICK.  Extra points for Paul Barker puking behind his amp while barely 
missing a note on bass (the whole band was smashed drunk except Willie 
Rifkin from what I recall).  My heroes.  They hit every song I'd always 
wanted to hear live, did a Front242 cover, No Devotion, all that shit.

Members of Psychic TV @ Young Moguls (Los Angeles, ca):
I wasn't ready for this, but it was insanely fun.  It must have been 
around 91-92, first time I ever saw a lo-income visuals setup, quite 
badass.  Location was an old favorite of mine, a no liquor license coffee 
shop in a warehouse full of mostly industrial art.  Nowadays would seem 
passe, back then it was mind blowing... most notably a guy who had a show 
there where he created art deco fantasy pieces almost exclusively from 
welded together vintage car bumpers.  This was the pinnacle of that scene 
in LA, where I'd rubbed elbows with RHCP, Fishbone, Janes, Beck, etc.  We 
were trying to push further in all these different directions and these 
psychotic brits came and shit in our oatmeal.

Living Color - Rock for Choice Benefit @ the Palladium (Los Angeles, CA) 
There was a string of these events actually, quite nutty.  Social 
Distortion, Lunachicks, L7, Pornos for Pyros, Helmet, list goes on.  The 
living color show stuck out cause they were shiny new fun, and the pit for 
some of the double time breakdowns was just completely fanatical.  
Probably sold the place to about 4000 capacity, stand row only, just 
madness.

Course of Empire (Salt Lake City, Utah)
I was living in SLC for a year circa 93-94.  This band had popped up on 
the radar with a sorta swingy pop-industrial tune called "Infested".  I 
bought tickets, cause nobody came thru town that was any good.  First or 
second song, they threw out plastic buckets and drumsticks, amazingly good 
noisey show.  Went home drunk, sweaty, exhausted, no knees left, a brand 
new pair of 10 holes I was wearing had scuffmarks all the way up to where 
the bottoms of my pants had gotten ripped up, I taught class the next 
monday with a still slightly black eye and there wasn't any bad blood in 
the place, just frenzied music energy and morons bouncing off each other.

Pixies, 2005 (berkeley, ca):
I'd gotten so mentally screwed over by some weird life shit in the months 
prior, and then my friends drag me out to this.  Fixed me in a big way, 
just an awesome show.

Dead Can Dance, 2005 (oakland, ca):
Most fun I ever had sitting thru a band with "dance" in their name, just 
amazingly beautiful.  Ran into a friend who found out it was my birthday 
and traded tickets with me, 4th row.  Droooool.

Oingo Boingo - Dio de los Muertos shows (yearly tradition, Irvine Meadows, 
Ca)
these were consistently some of the funnest shows around, what a great 
band, what a great crowd.  What an incredible amount of puke.

Body Count (Gazarri's, Los Angeles, CA):
One of the first shows from Ice-T's rap rock creation, fucking badass at 
the time.  Of course, I'd trade this show in for the genre never having 
existed, but a good time was had by all.

Sonic Youth (or maybe it was Kim's other band at the time...) + Pornos for 
Pyros + Rage Against the Machine (Lake Castaic, CA):
WTF, best sound I've ever heard at an outdoor venue.  Bass that was clean 
and caused ones eyes to jiggle when looking at a far away object.  
Freaking insane.  Also, this was before RATM was getting airplay, and boy 
did they seem angry.

Sonic Youth (Warfield, SF, ca):
For their Washing Machine tour, a band I'd given up hope on after a couple 
lackluster pop attempts fucking rinsed it with an incredible set of 
bizarre riff punk art rock only they can do right, head down gronky bong 
music mixed with a great crowd that would border on pit frenzy action but 
never get downright wicked.

Lollapalooza (Irvine Meadows, ca):
I HATED Janes Addicition, I'd met a couple of them being in an overlappig 
social circle.  They seemed like artsy rich kid guitar school buttheads.  
But, from the first song to the last when they headlined this show I was 
in mind blown awe.  Incredible interpretations of their recorded versions, 
stage show, lights, all that.  Incredible.  I think Jesus and Mary Chain 
also played the same one (might have been a later one, dunno), but they 
blew cracked my skull as well... best rock bass tone ever combined with 
a dense wall of guitar chord and that "I'm singing this song even though I 
can't sing on heroin" delivery.

Organic 96, LA, ca
If I ran the lineup by you, you'd puke.

Dread Zeppelin (CSUN, Northridge, ca):
Best novelty act ever, this was early on when they had the Elvis 
impersonator singing leads.  Just rich.  Scary how well they could play 
too.  Reggae + Led Zep + Elvis crooning over it > all.

Primus NYE (sf, ca):
Some people hate Primus cause they are annoying.  Others love them because 
they are annoying.  Great show, ridiculously fun.  Say baby, SAY 
BABBBBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYYY!

Christian Death @ Helter Skelter (LA, CA):
You can't call yourself proper California goth till you've seen this shit 
at least once.  Extra points for the show getting called early cause the 
guitarist broke something on his tremelo... seeing a crowd of what looked 
like sad scorched butterflies from a black and white movie almost pissed 
enough to riot will never leave my mind.

Rush, Irvine Meadows, ca:
Ok, so i also like this nerdy band.  I'm a fucking nerd, get over it.  
This one time, I saw them with my mom and my stepdad (who is also a fan).  
Guy in the row behind us passes me a joint, and I check to see if my mom 
is looking, sneak a hit, nod and smile and hand it back to him.  Right as 
I'm about to exhale, my mom looks right at me.  I'm willing to guess I 
held my breath there for about a minute thirty before she looked away.  
Almost passed out in a big way.

Beastie Boys - Free Tibet shows (polo fields, GG park, ca):
Great shows, great vibe.  A little hot and silly but overall I've always 
been a fan of positivity in this kinda context.  Sabotage had just come 
out and the Beasties really hit it home with a bit more of the punk shit 
than usual.  Good times.

Timothy Leary and Excene Cervenka @ Highland grounds (sf, ca):
Sickest spoken word I've ever attendeded, it was a look back on the life 
of Burroughs to boot with a gallery of photos he'd taken, mostly of 
apples, guns, and his wife.

Tons more I'm sure, but I'll spare you for now.  :P

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Friendly Cat Needs A Home

Are you wanting to add a loving cat to your household? I've had a very 
friendly cat visiting my back door for the past month who's in need of a 
new family to make her their own. She appears to have been abandoned, as 
I've been unsuccessful in reuniting her with her humans. With the cold 
weather here, it would be wonderful to find her a warm, loving home. 
I've had her in the bathroom (I've got 2 other cats) these last two 
horribly cold nights where she's been purring, content, and seeming to 
appreciate the safe space.

The cat is black/brown with white paws and belly, medium build, and 
medium/long hair. She's female, very friendly, and affectionate. She 
looks very healthy and my best guess would be that she's around 3 or 4 
yrs. old. If interested in finding out more, please call Susan at 
415-831-5395 or email shack@kzsudj.mailshell.com.

that first photo is indeed the CF tent, but you can't really see it.

the second and third photos are *not* the CF tent. that would be center 
camp @ BM.

attached are a couple photos from my wedding, with the CF tent in the 
background.

from BM05 - the tent is the background in this photo, to the right:
   http://unsafe.nebcorp.com/~st_indigo/bm05/slides/DSC00033.html

and another good one:
   http://pics.feen.com/bm05/IMG_0127

the tent's footprint is 30' x 30', and the longest poles are 15' (if i 
recall correctly), it requires a good chunk of storage space (4' x 4' x 
15' or so - like along the wall of a garage). Ideally, you'll want a 
crew of about 10 people to set it up.

if you want details beyond that, you should ask Scott Nelson - 
drenalin@cloudfactory.org

often. I ask the man overseeing the destruction what kind of business =20=

he's putting up. "Real estate." Figures. I find a page from the =20
store's checkbook, a Saint Etienne poster and a tired dollar with =20
tape on it=97maybe the first dollar this store ever made. I load the =20
bins on top of my friend's car, and we head out in silence.

I've scavenged lots of vinyl from stores that were closing. I felt =20
like a villain buying every Exist Dance release at a cut rate, and =20
when I came across a discarded, unopened Beautiful People 12-inch I'd =20=

been looking for, it felt like the worst kind of gain, at the expense =20=

of another.

Hunting around Manhattan for $2 fixes, $5 splurges and $20 haggle-=20
downs, I find shops that are still doing OK. But for each survivor, =20
there are scores more stores you could pour liquor for. When I visit =20
the 8-by-20-foot Rainbow Records, 78-year-old Harry asks rhetorically =20=

why business is bad: "Because Tower is closing this weekend, so all =20
the kids are going there," he answers himself, sighing.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: contacts in Berlin

Greetings everyone!  Happy New Year. <3


I will be taking a pilgrimage to Berlin with my boyfriend Sean in late 
February/early March, and will be staying hopefully until the end of 
April.  We are going in order to spend some time with the German techno 
scene and hear some yummy music, pick up some new records, and hopefully 
make friends and learn some German.  Does anyone here have any contacts 
in Berlin, for perhaps either a place to stay, connections to the 
electronic music scene, DJing gigs, etc etc ? 


We are hoping to find a place to stay with some other like minded 
electronic music enthusiasts... If you know someone or have any ideas, 
please forward them our housing-wanted post from craigslist -- 
http://berlin.craigslist.org/sbw/258358731.html


Thanks!
Love Chelsea

A Time to Break Silence

By Rev. Martin Luther King

By 1967, King had become the country's most prominent opponent of the  
Vietnam War, and a staunch critic of overall U.S. foreign policy,  
which he deemed militaristic. In his "Beyond Vietnam" speech  
delivered at New York's Riverside Church on April 4, 1967 -- a year  
to the day before he was murdered -- King called the United States  
"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today."

Time magazine called the speech "demagogic slander that sounded like  
a script for Radio Hanoi," and the Washington Post declared that King  
had "diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people."

Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence
By Rev. Martin Luther King
4 April 1967

Speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1967, at  
a meeting of Clergy and Laity Concerned at Riverside Church in New  
York City

I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my  
conscience leaves me no other choice. I join with you in this meeting  
because I am in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the  
organization which has brought us together: Clergy and Laymen  
Concerned about Vietnam. The recent statement of your executive  
committee are the sentiments of my own heart and I found myself in  
full accord when I read its opening lines: "A time comes when silence  
is betrayal." That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.

The truth of these words is beyond doubt but the mission to which  
they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the  
demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing  
their government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the  
human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of  
conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding  
world. Moreover when the issues at hand seem as perplexed as they  
often do in the case of this dreadful conflict we are always on the  
verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty; but we must move on.

Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night  
have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony,  
but we must speak. We must speak with all the humility that is  
appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak. And we must  
rejoice as well, for surely this is the first time in our nation's  
history that a significant number of its religious leaders have  
chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the  
high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience  
and the reading of history. Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us.  
If it is, let us trace its movement well and pray that our own inner  
being may be sensitive to its guidance, for we are deeply in need of  
a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us.

Over the past two years, as I have moved to break the betrayal of my  
own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart, as I  
have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam,  
many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path. At the  
heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud:  
Why are you speaking about war, Dr. King? Why are you joining the  
voices of dissent? Peace and civil rights don't mix, they say. Aren't  
you hurting the cause of your people, they ask? And when I hear them,  
though I often understand the source of their concern, I am  
nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the  
inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling.  
Indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the world in  
which they live.

In the light of such tragic misunderstandings, I deem it of signal  
importance to try to state clearly, and I trust concisely, why I  
believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church -- the church  
in Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate -- leads clearly  
to this sanctuary tonight.

I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my  
beloved nation. This speech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the  
National Liberation Front. It is not addressed to China or to Russia.

Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation  
and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam.  
Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National  
Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they  
can play in a successful resolution of the problem. While they both  
may have justifiable reason to be suspicious of the good faith of the  
United States, life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact  
that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on  
both sides.

Tonight, however, I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the NLF, but  
rather to my fellow Americans, who, with me, bear the greatest  
responsibility in ending a conflict that has exacted a heavy price on  
both continents.

The Importance of Vietnam

Since I am a preacher by trade, I suppose it is not surprising that I  
have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the field of my  
moral vision. There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile  
connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others,  
have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining  
moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of  
hope for the poor -- both black and white -- through the poverty  
program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the  
buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated  
as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on  
war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds  
or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like  
Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic  
destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the  
war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such.

Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it  
became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating  
the hopes of the poor at home. It was sending their sons and their  
brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinarily  
high proportions relative to the rest of the population. We were  
taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and  
sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in  
Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East  
Harlem. So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of  
watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die  
together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in  
the same schools. So we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the  
huts of a poor village, but we realize that they would never live on  
the same block in Detroit. I could not be silent in the face of such  
cruel manipulation of the poor.

My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it  
grows out of my experience in the ghettoes of the North over the last  
three years -- especially the last three summers. As I have walked  
among the desperate, rejected and angry young men I have told them  
that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I  
have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my  
conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through  
nonviolent action. But they asked -- and rightly so -- what about  
Vietnam? They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of  
violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted.  
Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise  
my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without  
having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in  
the world today -- my own government. For the sake of those boys, for  
the sake of this government, for the sake of hundreds of thousands  
trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.

For those who ask the question, "Aren't you a civil rights leader?"  
and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have  
this further answer. In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern  
Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: "To save the  
soul of America." We were convinced that we could not limit our  
vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the  
conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself  
unless the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the  
shackles they still wear. In a way we were agreeing with Langston  
Hughes, that black bard of Harlem, who had written earlier:

O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath--
America will be!

Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any  
concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the  
present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the  
autopsy must read Vietnam. It can never be saved so long as it  
destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those  
of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the  
path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land.

As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of  
America were not enough, another burden of responsibility was placed  
upon me in 1964; and I cannot forget that the Nobel Prize for Peace  
was also a commission -- a commission to work harder than I had ever  
worked before for "the brotherhood of man." This is a calling that  
takes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were not present  
I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the  
ministry of Jesus Christ. To me the relationship of this ministry to  
the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those  
who ask me why I am speaking against the war. Could it be that they  
do not know that the good news was meant for all men -- for Communist  
and capitalist, for their children and ours, for black and for white,  
for revolutionary and conservative? Have they forgotten that my  
ministry is in obedience to the one who loved his enemies so fully  
that he died for them? What then can I say to the "Vietcong" or to  
Castro or to Mao as a faithful minister of this one? Can I threaten  
them with death or must I not share with them my life?

Finally, as I try to delineate for you and for myself the road that  
leads from Montgomery to this place I would have offered all that was  
most valid if I simply said that I must be true to my conviction that  
I share with all men the calling to be a son of the living God.  
Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of  
sonship and brotherhood, and because I believe that the Father is  
deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and  
outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them.

This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who  
deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader  
and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation's self- 
defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak, for  
the voiceless, for victims of our nation and for those it calls  
enemy, for no document from human hands can make these humans any  
less our brothers.

Strange Liberators

And as I ponder the madness of Vietnam and search within myself for  
ways to understand and respond to compassion my mind goes constantly  
to the people of that peninsula. I speak now not of the soldiers of  
each side, not of the junta in Saigon, but simply of the people who  
have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous  
decades now. I think of them too because it is clear to me that there  
will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to  
know them and hear their broken cries.

They must see Americans as strange liberators. The Vietnamese people  
proclaimed their own independence in 1945 after a combined French and  
Japanese occupation, and before the Communist revolution in China.  
They were led by Ho Chi Minh. Even though they quoted the American  
Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom, we  
refused to recognize them. Instead, we decided to support France in  
its reconquest of her former colony.

Our government felt then that the Vietnamese people were not "ready"  
for independence, and we again fell victim to the deadly Western  
arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long.  
With that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government  
seeking self-determination, and a government that had been  
established not by China (for whom the Vietnamese have no great love)  
but by clearly indigenous forces that included some Communists. For  
the peasants this new government meant real land reform, one of the  
most important needs in their lives.

For nine years following 1945 we denied the people of Vietnam the  
right of independence. For nine years we vigorously supported the  
French in their abortive effort to recolonize Vietnam.

Before the end of the war we were meeting eighty percent of the  
French war costs. Even before the French were defeated at Dien Bien  
Phu, they began to despair of the reckless action, but we did not. We  
encouraged them with our huge financial and military supplies to  
continue the war even after they had lost the will. Soon we would be  
paying almost the full costs of this tragic attempt at recolonization.

After the French were defeated it looked as if independence and land  
reform would come again through the Geneva agreements. But instead  
there came the United States, determined that Ho should not unify the  
temporarily divided nation, and the peasants watched again as we  
supported one of the most vicious modern dictators -- our chosen man,  
Premier Diem. The peasants watched and cringed as Diem ruthlessly  
routed out all opposition, supported their extortionist landlords and  
refused even to discuss reunification with the north. The peasants  
watched as all this was presided over by U.S. influence and then by  
increasing numbers of U.S. troops who came to help quell the  
insurgency that Diem's methods had aroused. When Diem was overthrown  
they may have been happy, but the long line of military dictatorships  
seemed to offer no real change -- especially in terms of their need  
for land and peace.

The only change came from America as we increased our troop  
commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt,  
inept and without popular support. All the while the people read our  
leaflets and received regular promises of peace and democracy -- and  
land reform. Now they languish under our bombs and consider us -- not  
their fellow Vietnamese -- the real enemy. They move sadly and  
apathetically as we herd them off the land of their fathers into  
concentration camps where minimal social needs are rarely met. They  
know they must move or be destroyed by our bombs. So they go --  
primarily women and children and the aged.

They watch as we poison their water, as we kill a million acres of  
their crops. They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their  
areas preparing to destroy the precious trees. They wander into the  
hospitals, with at least twenty casualties from American firepower  
for one "Vietcong"-inflicted injury. So far we may have killed a  
million of them -- mostly children. They wander into the towns and  
see thousands of the children, homeless, without clothes, running in  
packs on the streets like animals. They see the children, degraded by  
our soldiers as they beg for food. They see the children selling  
their sisters to our soldiers, soliciting for their mothers.

What do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords  
and as we refuse to put any action into our many words concerning  
land reform? What do they think as we test our latest weapons on  
them, just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in  
the concentration camps of Europe? Where are the roots of the  
independent Vietnam we claim to be building? Is it among these  
voiceless ones?

We have destroyed their two most cherished institutions: the family  
and the village. We have destroyed their land and their crops. We  
have cooperated in the crushing of the nation's only non-Communist  
revolutionary political force -- the unified Buddhist church. We have  
supported the enemies of the peasants of Saigon. We have corrupted  
their women and children and killed their men. What liberators?

Now there is little left to build on -- save bitterness. Soon the  
only solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our  
military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call  
fortified hamlets. The peasants may well wonder if we plan to build  
our new Vietnam on such grounds as these? Could we blame them for  
such thoughts? We must speak for them and raise the questions they  
cannot raise. These too are our brothers.

Perhaps the more difficult but no less necessary task is to speak for  
those who have been designated as our enemies. What of the National  
Liberation Front -- that strangely anonymous group we call VC or  
Communists? What must they think of us in America when they realize  
that we permitted the repression and cruelty of Diem which helped to  
bring them into being as a resistance group in the south? What do  
they think of our condoning the violence which led to their own  
taking up of arms? How can they believe in our integrity when now we  
speak of "aggression from the north" as if there were nothing more  
essential to the war? How can they trust us when now we charge them  
with violence after the murderous reign of Diem and charge them with  
violence while we pour every new weapon of death into their land?  
Surely we must understand their feelings even if we do not condone  
their actions. Surely we must see that the men we supported pressed  
them to their violence. Surely we must see that our own computerized  
plans of destruction simply dwarf their greatest acts.

How do they judge us when our officials know that their membership is  
less than twenty-five percent Communist and yet insist on giving them  
the blanket name? What must they be thinking when they know that we  
are aware of their control of major sections of Vietnam and yet we  
appear ready to allow national elections in which this highly  
organized political parallel government will have no part? They ask  
how we can speak of free elections when the Saigon press is censored  
and controlled by the military junta. And they are surely right to  
wonder what kind of new government we plan to help form without them  
-- the only party in real touch with the peasants. They question our  
political goals and they deny the reality of a peace settlement from  
which they will be excluded. Their questions are frighteningly  
relevant. Is our nation planning to build on political myth again and  
then shore it up with the power of new violence?

Here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence when  
it helps us to see the enemy's point of view, to hear his questions,  
to know his assessment of ourselves. For from his view we may indeed  
see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature,  
we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who  
are called the opposition.

So, too, with Hanoi. In the north, where our bombs now pummel the  
land, and our mines endanger the waterways, we are met by a deep but  
understandable mistrust. To speak for them is to explain this lack of  
confidence in Western words, and especially their distrust of  
American intentions now. In Hanoi are the men who led the nation to  
independence against the Japanese and the French, the men who sought  
membership in the French commonwealth and were betrayed by the  
weakness of Paris and the willfulness of the colonial armies. It was  
they who led a second struggle against French domination at  
tremendous costs, and then were persuaded to give up the land they  
controlled between the thirteenth and seventeenth parallel as a  
temporary measure at Geneva. After 1954 they watched us conspire with  
Diem to prevent elections which would have surely brought Ho Chi Minh  
to power over a united Vietnam, and they realized they had been  
betrayed again.

When we ask why they do not leap to negotiate, these things must be  
remembered. Also it must be clear that the leaders of Hanoi  
considered the presence of American troops in support of the Diem  
regime to have been the initial military breach of the Geneva  
agreements concerning foreign troops, and they remind us that they  
did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until  
American forces had moved into the tens of thousands.

Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about  
the earlier North Vietnamese overtures for peace, how the president  
claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made. Ho Chi  
Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its  
forces, and now he has surely heard of the increasing international  
rumors of American plans for an invasion of the north. He knows the  
bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional  
pre-invasion strategy. Perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony  
can save him when he hears the most powerful nation of the world  
speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor weak  
nation more than eight thousand miles away from its shores.

At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these  
last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless on Vietnam and to  
understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am as  
deeply concerned about our troops there as anything else. For it  
occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not  
simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies  
face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the  
process of death, for they must know after a short period there that  
none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved.  
Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a  
struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize  
that we are on the side of the wealthy and the secure while we create  
hell for the poor.

This Madness Must Cease

Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child  
of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for  
those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being  
destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of  
America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and  
death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world,  
for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak  
as an American to the leaders of my own nation. The great initiative  
in this war is ours. The initiative to stop it must be ours.

This is the message of the great Buddhist leaders of Vietnam.  
Recently one of them wrote these words:

"Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the  
Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct. The  
Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies.  
It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the  
possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process  
they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat. The image  
of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom and  
democracy, but the image of violence and militarism."

If we continue, there will be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of  
the world that we have no honorable intentions in Vietnam. It will  
become clear that our minimal expectation is to occupy it as an  
American colony and men will not refrain from thinking that our  
maximum hope is to goad China into a war so that we may bomb her  
nuclear installations. If we do not stop our war against the people  
of Vietnam immediately the world will be left with no other  
alternative than to see this as some horribly clumsy and deadly game  
we have decided to play.

The world now demands a maturity of America that we may not be able  
to achieve. It demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the  
beginning of our adventure in Vietnam, that we have been detrimental  
to the life of the Vietnamese people. The situation is one in which  
we must be ready to turn sharply from our present ways.

In order to atone for our sins and errors in Vietnam, we should take  
the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war. I would like to  
suggest five concrete things that our government should do  
immediately to begin the long and difficult process of extricating  
ourselves from this nightmarish conflict:

End all bombing in North and South Vietnam.
Declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hope that such action will  
create the atmosphere for negotiation.
Take immediate steps to prevent other battlegrounds in Southeast Asia  
by curtailing our military buildup in Thailand and our interference  
in Laos.
Realistically accept the fact that the National Liberation Front has  
substantial support in South Vietnam and must thereby play a role in  
any meaningful negotiations and in any future Vietnam government.
Set a date that we will remove all foreign troops from Vietnam in  
accordance with the 1954 Geneva agreement.

Part of our ongoing commitment might well express itself in an offer  
to grant asylum to any Vietnamese who fears for his life under a new  
regime which included the Liberation Front. Then we must make what  
reparations we can for the damage we have done. We most provide the  
medical aid that is badly needed, making it available in this country  
if necessary.

Protesting The War

Meanwhile we in the churches and synagogues have a continuing task  
while we urge our government to disengage itself from a disgraceful  
commitment. We must continue to raise our voices if our nation  
persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam. We must be prepared to  
match actions with words by seeking out every creative means of  
protest possible.

As we counsel young men concerning military service we must clarify  
for them our nation's role in Vietnam and challenge them with the  
alternative of conscientious objection. I am pleased to say that this  
is the path now being chosen by more than seventy students at my own  
alma mater, Morehouse College, and I recommend it to all who find the  
American course in Vietnam a dishonorable and unjust one. Moreover I  
would encourage all ministers of draft age to give up their  
ministerial exemptions and seek status as conscientious objectors.  
These are the times for real choices and not false ones. We are at  
the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is  
to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions must decide  
on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest.

There is something seductively tempting about stopping there and  
sending us all off on what in some circles has become a popular  
crusade against the war in Vietnam. I say we must enter the struggle,  
but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing. The  
war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the  
American spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality we will find  
ourselves organizing clergy- and laymen-concerned committees for the  
next generation. They will be concerned about Guatemala and Peru.  
They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia. They will be  
concerned about Mozambique and South Africa. We will be marching for  
these and a dozen other names and attending rallies without end  
unless there is a significant and profound change in American life  
and policy. Such thoughts take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our  
calling as sons of the living God.

In 1957 a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to  
him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution.  
During the past ten years we have seen emerge a pattern of  
suppression which now has justified the presence of U.S. military  
"advisors" in Venezuela. This need to maintain social stability for  
our investments accounts for the counter-revolutionary action of  
American forces in Guatemala. It tells why American helicopters are  
being used against guerrillas in Colombia and why American napalm and  
green beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru.  
It is with such activity in mind that the words of the late John F.  
Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said, "Those who  
make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution  
inevitable."

Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation  
has taken -- the role of those who make peaceful revolution  
impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures  
that come from the immense profits of overseas investment.

I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world  
revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of  
values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a "thing-oriented"  
society to a "person-oriented" society. When machines and computers,  
profit motives and property rights are considered more important than  
people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are  
incapable of being conquered.

A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the  
fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the  
one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life's roadside;  
but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see  
that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women  
will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey  
on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a  
beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an  
edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. A true revolution  
of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty  
and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas  
and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of  
money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out  
with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say:  
"This is not just." It will look at our alliance with the landed  
gentry of Latin America and say: "This is not just." The Western  
arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and  
nothing to learn from them is not just. A true revolution of values  
will lay hands on the world order and say of war: "This way of  
settling differences is not just." This business of burning human  
beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and  
widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people  
normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody  
battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged,  
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love. A nation that  
continues year after year to spend more money on military defense  
than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.

America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well  
lead the way in this revolution of values. There is nothing, except a  
tragic death wish, to prevent us from reordering our priorities, so  
that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of  
war. There is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status  
quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood.

This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense  
against communism. War is not the answer. Communism will never be  
defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons. Let us not  
join those who shout war and through their misguided passions urge  
the United States to relinquish its participation in the United  
Nations. These are days which demand wise restraint and calm  
reasonableness. We must not call everyone a Communist or an appeaser  
who advocates the seating of Red China in the United Nations and who  
recognizes that hate and hysteria are not the final answers to the  
problem of these turbulent days. We must not engage in a negative  
anti-communism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy,  
realizing that our greatest defense against communism is to take  
offensive action in behalf of justice. We must with positive action  
seek to remove thosse conditions of poverty, insecurity and injustice  
which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and  
develops.

The People Are Important
These are revolutionary times. All over the globe men are revolting  
against old systems of exploitation and oppression and out of the  
wombs of a frail world new systems of justice and equality are being  
born. The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as  
never before. "The people who sat in darkness have seen a great  
light." We in the West must support these revolutions. It is a sad  
fact that, because of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of  
communism, and our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western  
nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the  
modern world have now become the arch anti-revolutionaries. This has  
driven many to feel that only Marxism has the revolutionary spirit.  
Therefore, communism is a judgement against our failure to make  
democracy real and follow through on the revolutions we initiated.  
Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the  
revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world  
declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism. With  
this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and  
unjust mores and thereby speed the day when "every valley shall be  
exalted, and every moutain and hill shall be made low, and the  
crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain."

A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our  
loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation  
must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order  
to preserve the best in their individual societies.

This call for a world-wide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern  
beyond one's tribe, race, class and nation is in reality a call for  
an all-embracing and unconditional love for all men. This oft  
misunderstood and misinterpreted concept -- so readily dismissed by  
the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly force -- has now  
become an absolute necessity for the survival of man. When I speak of  
love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am  
speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as  
the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that  
unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-Moslem- 
Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about ultimate reality is  
beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John:

Let us love one another; for love is God and everyone that loveth is  
born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for  
God is love. If we love one another God dwelleth in us, and his love  
is perfected in us.

Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day. We can  
no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar  
of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever- 
rising tides of hate. History is cluttered with the wreckage of  
nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of  
hate. As Arnold Toynbee says : "Love is the ultimate force that makes  
for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of  
death and evil. Therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the  
hope that love is going to have the last word."

We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are  
confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding  
conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too  
late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves  
us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity. The  
"tide in the affairs of men" does not remain at the flood; it ebbs.  
We may cry out deperately for time to pause in her passage, but time  
is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and  
jumbled residue of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic  
words: "Too late." There is an invisible book of life that faithfully  
records our vigilance or our neglect. "The moving finger writes, and  
having writ moves on..." We still have a choice today; nonviolent  
coexistence or violent co-annihilation.

We must move past indecision to action. We must find new ways to  
speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing  
world -- a world that borders on our doors. If we do not act we shall  
surely be dragged down the long dark and shameful corridors of time  
reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might  
without morality, and strength without sight.

Now let us begin. Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and  
bitter -- but beautiful -- struggle for a new world. This is the  
callling of the sons of God, and our brothers wait eagerly for our  
response. Shall we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell them the  
struggle is too hard? Will our message be that the forces of American  
life militate against their arrival as full men, and we send our  
deepest regrets? Or will there be another message, of longing, of  
hope, of solidarity with their yearnings, of commitment to their  
cause, whatever the cost? The choice is ours, and though we might  
prefer it otherwise we must choose in this crucial moment of human  
history.

As that noble bard of yesterday, James Russell Lowell, eloquently  
stated:

Once to every man and nation
Comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth and falsehood,
For the good or evil side;
Some great cause, God's new Messiah,
Off'ring each the bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever
Twixt that darkness and that light.

Though the cause of evil prosper,
Yet 'tis truth alone is strong;
Though her portion be the scaffold,
And upon the throne be wrong:
Yet that scaffold sways the future,
And behind the dim unknown,
Standeth God within the shadow
Keeping watch above his own.

blah blah blah...

John Draper is a confirmed child molester.  Nuff said.  I think the creepy 
old man on Family Guy is based on him.

Seriously

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The Twilight Years of Cap'n Crunch

A perfect example of how people get the "ghetto" mentality that others
are holding them down and they can never succeed because they don't
have "opportunities". In reality they have tons of talent and
opportunities that they are afraid to work hard for. My step dad was
like that, "because he was not white" he could never have a better job
then being a security guard. Everyone was keeping him down.

I think the day we celebrate today should bring to light what Doc King
would feel about this type of attitude. He did a lot more then civil
rights, he brought about the ideals of personal responsibility.

>>
>> "Salmon," responded Mr. Draper, 63, who has few teeth and wears the

>> freewheeling, prank-filled culture that gave birth to high tech.
>>
>> "Salmon, all right!" cried Mr. Bengel. He set about preparing the
>> meal -- obtained free from a Whole Foods worker who leaves outdated
>> products near a dumpster at a prearranged time.
>>
>> In the decades since Mr. Draper gained fame for his hacking skills as
>> a "phone phreak" -- he once claimed to have gotten then-President
>> Nixon on the phone -- Silicon Valley has aged and matured. Pioneers
>> that Mr. Draper worked with, such as Apple's Steve Jobs, have gone on
>> to become wealthy members of the business establishment.
>>
>> THEN THERE is "Cap'n Crunch," part of an aging community of high-tech
>> wunderkinds. Once tolerated, even embraced, for his eccentricities,
>> Mr. Draper now lives on the margins of this affluent world, still
>> striving to carve out a role in the business mainstream.
>>
>> Although his appearance and hand-to-mouth existence belie it, Mr.
>> Draper developed one of the first word-processing programs as well as
>> the technology that made possible voice-activated telephone menus. He
>> receives invitations to speak to foreign governments and
>> international conferences. At a recent celebration of Apple Inc.'s
>> 30th anniversary, Mr. Draper, sporting a straggly beard, stood to
>> contribute a story, causing the room to break into applause.
>>
>> Mr. Draper spent three stints in jail in the 1970s for tampering with
>> the phone system. A court-appointed psychiatrist once found him to be
>> "psychotic," although another found nothing wrong with him. Until a
>> fall at a conference in Istanbul aggravated a back injury, Mr. Draper
>> was a regular in the rave scene, where people gather in remote
>> locations and dance through the night to electronic music. Mr. Draper
>> once did $10,000 worth of Web-site design and other computer work for
>> a Bay-area therapist in return for physical therapy on his back
>> because he lacks health insurance.
>>
>> "When I first met him, he was toothless, wearing ripped jeans and
>> looked like a hippie," says Tolga Katas, a music producer and
>> computer programmer in Las Vegas who recently hired Mr. Draper to do
>> technical work for his new Web entertainment company. "Then I learned
>> what he has done and was blown away."
>>
>> Mr. Draper calls aging veterans like himself part of an "off-the-

>> cellphone technology and does programming work for startups. In
>> recent years, he's lived on the floors and couches of employers; he
>> was last seen hitchhiking in the desert outside Las Vegas. Roy
>> Kaylor, 68, built one of the first electric cars in the early 1970s
>> and contributed to a government-supported effort to develop the
>> technology. He lives in a trailer without electricity in the Santa
>> Cruz mountains. Mr. Draper's recent lunch host, Mr. Bengel, 61,
>> designed an electrohydraulic machine tool and says he has worked for
>> several Silicon Valley companies.
>>
>> Mr. Draper is the best known. "He was the king of the nerds," says
>> Allan Lundell, who runs an independent film company and has
>> chronicled the evolution of Silicon Valley.
>>
>> Mr. Draper's father was a U.S. Air Force engineer and the family
>> moved frequently. His younger brother, Ron, recalls John rummaging
>> for electronic parts on military bases where the family lived, on one
>> occasion building a radio station in his bedroom.
>>
>> John was not an easy child, often bucking under the authority of his
>> sometimes-distant father, who is now deceased. John threw tantrums
>> when his parents smoked, says Ron, a piano teacher. Mr. Draper says
>> he hated his parents' smoking and felt aggrieved by their refusal to
>> stop.
>>
>> "Our father didn't understand what John needed, which was a constant
>> supply of education and resources," says Ron. "He absorbed this stuff
>> like a sponge." Ron Draper says his parents briefly sought
>> psychiatric treatment for his brother when he was a child for what
>> they said was a "chemical imbalance.
>>
>> "I liked the sessions," says Mr. Draper of the psychiatric
>> counseling. "At least someone was listening to me." He acknowledges
>> he can become obsessive but denies the idea there's anything wrong
>> with him.
>>
>> In 1964, after taking some college courses, Mr. Draper joined the Air
>> Force, which his parents thought would provide much-needed
>> discipline. He was sent to Alaska and later Maine, where he served as
>> a radar technician. Since the soldiers had only one phone line on
>> which to call home, Mr. Draper began tinkering with the access codes
>> and figured out how to make free calls through the local switchboard.
>>
>> After an honorable discharge in 1968, he built gear for several
>> companies in the San Francisco Bay area. But his work, much of which
>> was military-related, was out of step with the counterculture
>> blooming around him. Mr. Draper grew his hair and began spending more
>> time on a pirate radio station, which he operated from the back of
>> his green Volkswagen van to make it harder for authorities to track
>> the signal. He also turned his attention to the phone system, an
>> attraction for like-minded techies before the arrival of personal
>> computers.
>>
>> Mr. Draper learned how to make free calls by imitating the tones used
>> by the phone company. He learned from other "phone phreaks" -- as the
>> hackers called themselves -- including blind teenagers with near-  
>> perfect pitch. Mr. Draper learned that a toy whistle found in a
>> cereal box would also imitate the required tones, earning him the
>> nickname Cap'n Crunch.
>>
>> The point was not just to make free calls but to explore and learn
>> from the phone company's rich and complicated system. On one

>> with the president -- "Olympus" -- and got through to someone on a
>> secure line he thought was President Nixon. Mr. Draper says he told
>> the man about a toilet-paper shortage in Los Angeles.
>>
>> Authorities began to take notice, particularly after a lengthy
>> article on phone phreaking appeared in the October 1971 edition of
>> Esquire magazine. Mr. Draper, the group's ringleader, was arrested
>> for the first time several months later on charges of wire fraud, and
>> received a five-year probation.
>>
>> The Esquire article also caught the attention of Steve Wozniak, an
>> eventual Apple co-founder, who invited Mr. Draper to his dorm room at
>> the University of California at Berkeley. When Mr. Draper appeared
>> that evening, Mr. Wozniak, then 21, was taken aback by his guest's
>> appearance and odor, Mr. Wozniak wrote in his recent autobiography.
>>
>> "Are you Cap'n Crunch?" Mr. Wozniak asked in disbelief, according to
>> the book.
>>
>> "I am he," Mr. Draper responded as he strode into the room.
>>
>> Mr. Draper showed Mr. Wozniak and a friend, Mr. Jobs, how to build a
>> device that could produce telephone tones. The pair turned the
>> knowledge into a small business on the Berkeley campus, their first
>> collaboration before founding Apple a few years later.
>>
>> Mr. Wozniak employed Mr. Draper at Apple, where as a contractor in
>> 1977 he designed a device that could immediately identify phone
>> signals and lines -- such as ones that made free calls -- something
>> modems were not able to do for a decade. The technology would later
>> be used for tone-activated calling menus, voice mail and other  
>> purposes.
>>
>> APPLE DROPPED the device, called a phone board, anxious to avoid
>> negative publicity from its association with illegal phoning,
>> according to former Apple employees. "It was a great board and others
>> at Apple didn't recognize that," says Mr. Wozniak. Mr. Draper became
>> closer to Mr. Wozniak than to Mr. Jobs, who sometimes felt
>> uncomfortable around Mr. Draper, former Apple employees recall.
>>
>> "John was a little strange and Jobs felt better staying away from
>> him," says Mr. Wozniak, who has remained in touch with Mr. Draper
>> over the years. Mr. Jobs in an email declines to comment.
>>
>> Just as the computer revolution was about to begin, Mr. Draper's
>> legal problems steered him away from the action. He was sentenced to
>> prison for phone fraud in 1976 and again in 1978, and says he was
>> attacked during that second stint by an inmate with a baseball bat,
>> permanently damaging his back.
>>
>> The next year -- after his third bust for phone fraud -- he was
>> berated for his behavior. "You have to pay for your long-distance
>> phone calls," a San Jose U.S. District Court judge told Mr. Draper at
>> his sentencing, according to an account in the San Francisco
>> Chronicle. "Is that a very difficult moral concept to grasp?"
>>
>> Mr. Draper's lawyer replied: "His entire reality has to do with the
>> technology of computers and telephones. When he gets involved with
>> the technology aspect, he loses all sense of morality."
>>
>> TWO COURT-APPOINTED psychiatrists examined Mr. Draper. One concluded
>> he had an "underdeveloped sense of people" and was "psychotic"; the
>> other found nothing wrong with him, according to the Chronicle  
>> article.
>>
>> In 1979, while serving a sentence of a year of nights in the Alameda
>> County jail -- it was later reduced to a few months -- Mr. Draper
>> wrote the EasyWriter word-processing program. At night he wrote code
>> in longhand, diligently preparing for the next day when he could
>> spend time in the offices of a software company he founded with  
>> friends.
>>
>> Mr. Draper received permission from the sheriff's office to attend a
>> computer fair in 1979 in San Francisco, where the program, named
>> after the cult film "Easy Rider," was a hit. It became Apple's first
>> word-processing program. When IBM launched its first PC, it also
>> chose EasyWriter, over competition from other programmers, including
>> a young Bill Gates.
>>
>> Mr. Draper bought a Mercedes and a home in Hawaii. But the company he
>> founded, Cap'n Software Inc., earned less than $1 million in revenue
>> over a six-year period, according to Mr. Draper and Matthew McIntosh,
>> who ran operations. The real winner was Bill Baker, who handled
>> EasyWriter's distribution and marketing through his own company.
>> Without Mr. Draper's knowledge, Mr. Baker hired his own programmers
>> to create EasyWriter II just as Cap'n Software was publishing
>> EasyWriter 1.1.
>>
>> Cap'n Software sued and the matter was settled in court with Mr.
>> Baker paying the pair an undisclosed amount. Mr. Baker, now an

Care to provide ONE piece of evidence that this is true?

This is like saying that all homosexuals are pedophiles

Pretty much.

If you've ever spent any time with him at the various hacker cons, then you 
know what I'm talking about with Draper.  I think it was HOPE 2K he was 
there.  Some great cadid shots of him drolling on the teen boys.  He was 
also asking them things like "You want a massage?  I'll give ya one..  come 
on over and take your shirt off..."

His entire claim to fame (Hack/Phreak) is that he figured out that the Capt 
Crunch whistles in the 70's generated a 2600hz tone.  It's cool.  100% 
accidental, but ya know, thsoe are some of the best accidents.  Beyond that 
his talent barely exceeded Carolyn Meniel.

Everyone likes to bag on Mitnick, but he's a far more interesting guy.

(Waiting for Greg A [XS WHERE YOU AT??] to chime in on this thread)

Weird behavior is 100% the norm in hacker circles and cons.  It goes with 
the territory.  Not a one of them that aren't into some form of deviant 
sexual behavior, present company included.  Everything from BDSM, Ian 
Goldbergs Tactile Parties, strange orgies, Goatse.cx and Tubgirl, grandad 
gay pr0n, any anything else bizzare and twisted.

Still though, gotta draw the line somewhere.  Over the years back in the 
days of User meetings, BBS's, etc there would be pedofiles draw towards 
online because of the format it offers. They were pretty easy to spot, 
typically some middle aged guy taking WAY too much interest in the 12yo's 
at the meetings.

Like I stated in my other post...   first hand, yes.  Not actually watching 
him play hide the pastrami with a 13yo boy,
but none the less, coming up with excuses to sit real close, chat quietly, etc.

I mean, I could totally see him at little league finals saying "It must be 
my birthday!"

No no...  homosexuals are perverts...  and god bless every one of them for it.

Seriously though....  I'm sorry to knock your role model around, but what 
kind of evidense are you looking for?  DNA tests?  Private amusement park 
in his back yard?  Caught jerking off to the movie Stand By Me?

If I can dig up any of the H2K pics...  I'll link'em.. They're pretty 
funny.  I thin Veggie might have takens them.  Can't remember...  (fried 
brain cells)

So, he likes to give massages to young boys.  And then wrap his body
around them claiming it to be a specialized massage technique.  And he
was poor skinny geek in federal prison with hardcore criminals for several 
years.

Those are the facts.  Any extrapolation is opinion.

tick, tick, tick, still waiting for the maybe half dozen young men  
subscribed to the list that have had run-ins with this guy.  oh, but  
hey, i think john draper has been covered over, and over, and over.   
i think the only lesson learned is if i want a lot of articles  
written about me i need to do what he does.

no thanks didn't have to think about that for long

Thanks.

Today is the one day of the year that I go by, and allow others to, address
me by my birth name, Martin.

Just posted this http://tinyurl.como/y6j9hw a few hours back and even though
she was out sick today, they ran the audio of it on Randy' Rhodes's
AirAmerica show, which is turning into an annual tradition it seems cause
she played the clip last year too.

Peisces,

Well if the war between Iraq and the United States was one of equals, ie
Iraq had 300 million people in it instead of 25 million, (12x smaller than
the USA), then the the 655,000 dead Iraqis that we murdered would be about 8
million people, or the entire population of New York City.

655,000 x 12 = 7,860,00

History will not judge us kindly for this atrocious travesty.

Time magazine called the speech "demagogic slander that sounded like

Fuck these people and their goddamned piece of shit opinions.

Why are *any* of us still paying any attention to any of these monsters?

Don't fight 'em, let's just turn our backs on them instead.

> Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National
> Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they

> The Importance of Vietnam
>
> Since I am a preacher by trade, I suppose it is not surprising that I
> have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the field of my
> moral vision. There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile
> connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others,
> have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining
> moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of
> hope for the poor -- both black and white -- through the poverty
> program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the
> buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated
> as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on
> war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds
> or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like
> Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic
> destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the
> war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such.
>
> Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it
> became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating
> the hopes of the poor at home. It was sending their sons and their
> brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinarily
> high proportions relative to the rest of the population. We were
> taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and
> sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in
> Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East
> Harlem. So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of
> watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die
> together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in
> the same schools. So we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the
> huts of a poor village, but we realize that they would never live on
> the same block in Detroit. I could not be silent in the face of such
> cruel manipulation of the poor.
>
> My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it
> grows out of my experience in the ghettoes of the North over the last
> three years -- especially the last three summers. As I have walked
> among the desperate, rejected and angry young men I have told them
> that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I
> have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my
> conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through
> nonviolent action. But they asked -- and rightly so -- what about
> Vietnam? They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of
> violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted.
> Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise
> my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without
> having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in
> the world today -- my own government. For the sake of those boys, for
> the sake of this government, for the sake of hundreds of thousands
> trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.
>
> For those who ask the question, "Aren't you a civil rights leader?"
> and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have
> this further answer. In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern
> Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: "To save the
> soul of America." We were convinced that we could not limit our
> vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the
> conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself
> unless the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the
> shackles they still wear. In a way we were agreeing with Langston
> Hughes, that black bard of Harlem, who had written earlier:
>
> O, yes,
> I say it plain,
> America never was America to me,
> And yet I swear this oath--
> America will be!
>
> Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any
> concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the
> present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the
> autopsy must read Vietnam. It can never be saved so long as it
> destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those
> of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the
> path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land.
>
> As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of
> America were not enough, another burden of responsibility was placed
> upon me in 1964; and I cannot forget that the Nobel Prize for Peace
> was also a commission -- a commission to work harder than I had ever
> worked before for "the brotherhood of man." This is a calling that
> takes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were not present
> I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the
> ministry of Jesus Christ. To me the relationship of this ministry to
> the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those
> who ask me why I am speaking against the war. Could it be that they
> do not know that the good news was meant for all men -- for Communist
> and capitalist, for their children and ours, for black and for white,
> for revolutionary and conservative? Have they forgotten that my
> ministry is in obedience to the one who loved his enemies so fully
> that he died for them? What then can I say to the "Vietcong" or to
> Castro or to Mao as a faithful minister of this one? Can I threaten
> them with death or must I not share with them my life?
>
> Finally, as I try to delineate for you and for myself the road that
> leads from Montgomery to this place I would have offered all that was
> most valid if I simply said that I must be true to my conviction that
> I share with all men the calling to be a son of the living God.
> Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of
> sonship and brotherhood, and because I believe that the Father is
> deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and
> outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them.
>
> This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who

>
> End all bombing in North and South Vietnam.
> Declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hope that such action will

> Realistically accept the fact that the National Liberation Front has

> Protesting The War

I'd Rather Be A Matin' Than A Hatin' ~ Me

"Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have
laptops,cellphones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod
along with books." ~ Harper Lee, 2006

"There aren't a lot of things in this world that one can be sure
of, but I do know this; anytime you go by a House of Worship, of any
size, and of any denomination, that's filled to its rafters with
people, you can be certain that the vast majority of those people
haven't actually taken the time out to read The Bible, or whatever
ancient, "Sacred Text" that they subscribe to, because if they had read
it, and comprehended it, then that House of Worship would be nearly
empty." ~Nyc Alberts, NYC, October, 2006

"Ha ha!  Ever had the feeling you've been cheated?" ~ J. Lydon, SF, 1978

Hi freakzone.  Been awhile...

I've heard stories.  I've also heard hets on this very list running  
on about fucking underage raver girls.  Used to be some underage  
"jailbait" club.  Then visa versa. One rave "godmother" who does  
young men has an absolutely unnerving hatred of men who like younger  
girls.  Depends, I guess, on your perspective.....

Personally I'm not interested in any of this bedroom gossip.  Draper  
is a very smart guy and does have those who respect that.

Finally, I doubt any of the anti-Draper posters actually read the  
article.

The Needle and the Damage Done

By Michael Vazquez
Photography by Jaime Chard


ROCKS IN YOUR HEAD GETS ROCKED

The ad was pretty straightforward: Free record bins; must pick up =20
today. I headed over, not noticing the address until I crossed the =20
bridge: 157 Prince Street. It was Rock in Your Head record store in =20
SoHo. I felt like an ambulance driver called to a family member's =20
house. I clung to optimism, and then saw the toppled display cases, =20
footprint-stained records on the floor. A few months ago I'd been =20
here trading=97the clerk gave me a better-than-expected price, and a 7-=20=

inch poetically titled "Spinning and Scratching" backed with "Ageing =20
Had Never Been His Friend" by Love Is All. I shoulda come here more =20
often. I ask the man overseeing the destruction what kind of business =20=

he's putting up. "Real estate." Figures. I find a page from the =20
store's checkbook, a Saint Etienne poster and a tired dollar with =20
tape on it=97maybe the first dollar this store ever made. I load the =20
bins on top of my friend's car, and we head out in silence.

I've scavenged lots of vinyl from stores that were closing. I felt =20
like a villain buying every Exist Dance release at a cut rate, and =20
when I came across a discarded, unopened Beautiful People 12-inch I'd =20=

been looking for, it felt like the worst kind of gain, at the expense =20=

of another.

Hunting around Manhattan for $2 fixes, $5 splurges and $20 haggle-=20
downs, I find shops that are still doing OK. But for each survivor, =20
there are scores more stores you could pour liquor for. When I visit =20
the 8-by-20-foot Rainbow Records, 78-year-old Harry asks rhetorically =20=

why business is bad: "Because Tower is closing this weekend, so all =20
the kids are going there," he answers himself, sighing.

yea, you're right, i really didn't read it.  why should i, in other  
words, what is it about?  can you synopsize it so i don't have to?  i  
guess i'd rather spend my time on other things like 9/11 truth and  
the encroaching police state.  anyway, i glanced it and it talked  
about him living in a van down by the river or something.

LOL...

Yes..  because we know that the truth is always found from Judge and 
Jury.  Criminals go to prison and the innocent are freed.

I'd love to vacation in your world someday.

Heh I dunno how I missed this-

I personally know 2 people who have detailed their interactions with  
him to me-
These support the "rumors"- and these are people that I trust to give  
an accurate account.
But yanno what?
I don't care- so the guy likes the fresh-faced younger guys.
I give a shit?
I'll be doing the same goddamn thing when I'm 50+
I'll be whistling all I want at the 16/17/18yo girls because shit-  
I'm way past my prime for any actual interaction, so I'm gonna live  
it up as vicariously as I can.
Draper::Sold.
With a little search, you'll find that this has been discussed about  
10 times over the past 10 years on this very list- so no need to  
rehash anything.
He's an old man, and we've all had our trials and tribulations- so  
let it be.

What's funny is the ravers running to his defense and most hackers hating

The problem with my job is I somehow have to manage all this stuff,
and somehow do my radio show, and somehow make films, and somehow pay
my bills, and somehow see my family, and somehow floss my teeth.  I
mean, I have to hurry to floss my teeth, I work so much.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The Twilight Years of Cap'n Crunch

Okay, I'll come out. I've had a Cap'n Crunch tune-up. San Diego (when we 
both moved there separately, for separate reasons)

Massage? Nope.
Holding weird positions that I've never seen in yoga? Pretty much.
Bad Chiropractic practices? felt like it.
Sexual? Nope.
Perverted? If you perceived it to be.
Would I do it again if the Crunch were a hot chick instead? Absolutely :-)

There's no denying it's a bit weird, esp. since it's also very clear he 
targets boys, it's really not fair to convict him of molestation since 
it's never been proven.

It's not the boys aspect, IMHO, it's the ages..  He's always liked'em 
young, a bit too young...15, 16, etc.

I'd feel the same way if it were M or F.  Sure, everyone makes jokes about 
wanting a 18yo toy to play with, but honestly, what's the difference 
between somebody the day befor etheir 18th B-day, and the day after?  Not a 
damn thing in my book.  It's an abritrary age set for legal reasons of 
having a definative line in the sand.

Sadly, in our society we pat somebody on the back for banging a girl on her 
18th birthday and slap cuffs and give'em 20 years if it's the day before.

Ok, I must be weird, but I never got the whole young thing. I've
listened to many locker room talks where guys are going on about young
teens and how they love to see them and have fantasies. Personally I
never got the point. Maybe I got my fill when I was in HS/college, but
I personally am more attracted to a healthy woman that is near my age
(30). I just don't get why anyone would want to be with an annoying,
immature teenaged person (like they talk too much like about like
nothing yo). Even for sex I would rather be with a pro then a novice.
but whatever, I guess I'm strange.

A lot of men(and women) have this egotistical desire to be 'the one that
they remember' and that drive tends to push them towards the younger folk.

im in agreement with you on the 30ish women...much better, know what they
want and can hold a conversation.

I love sex with 30+ women, albeit it is a bit tiring, i usually have to take
a little break every 3 or 4.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The Twilight Years of Cap'n Crunch

i'll chime in that i never really understood what the big deal was if  
someone is male or female and older or younger and likes the opposite  
of either the same sex or opposite sex.  is that umbrella enough for  
everyone?  the thing that made me wonder about it is the age of  
consent varies in different states.  isn't it like 12 or 13 in some  
states where it's 18 in most?  who determines these things anyway?

now as a free thinking person of free will, i believe i get to choose  
who i want to hang out with and who i don't.  i met john years ago at  
some party, i can't even remember, and i'll admit i'm freaked out by  
the fact he has a lot of missing teeth and wild hair and glasses.   
well, the glasses, i don't care about.  it's just he seems someone to  
me that doesn't take care of himself.  the observation by many that  
he seems to like young men really doesn't matter to me, though i get  
the feeling he's a bit persistent when maybe he ought to move on and  
find one that actually likes older men ... because i do think there  
is something for everyone in the world with 6 or 8 billion people ...  
btw, for the overpopulation hounds, i heard you could fit all the  
people in the world in the state of florida, but that's another  
thread for another day ...

anyway, if you personally like john draper and want to hang out with  
him or defend him against the allegations he's a child molester,  
which i thought that is what he went to jail for, but i could be  
wrong,  feel free and don't let me stop you.  and by the way, me  
saying these things about him i'm in no way saying i'm perfect or  
even better than him.  i was just wondering why someone wrote an  
article but hey what does it matter they have the right to, too.

was this a long enough post?  sheez.  better than turning on the boob  
tube, maybe.  i turned it on for 5 minutes and decided i didn't want  
to invest the time, even if it was DVR recorded.  that jake 2.0 show  
is just more government propaganda.  i didn't even feel like skimming  
through it today.

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Trance hang-out in Mission district

Hi everyone,

My name is Paul (DJ Paul Ephonic) and I just joined the list. I wanted 
to take a quick sec to mention this little get-together we've been 
having at my place for over a year now. Normally we just send these 
invites out to a couple small mailing lists, but since our usual 
suspects seem to be getting busy these days I figured I'd see if there's 
anyone else out there who might be into this sort of thing. You don't 
have to be an experienced DJ to spin here, but some experience helps. 
All we ask is that you provide us a list of tracks so we can give credit 
to the artists on our site.

More info...

What:
DJs spinning trance, hanging out, and eating food (usually order in or 
make something simple). You should come and
spin, or just hang out. If you want to spin, please make sure your 
tracks are some kind of trance (progressive, psy, etc.). We prefer to do 
a 3 track tag team between all the DJs since this is more social and 
means no one gets trapped behind the decks. Alternatively, we will let 
DJs have a 30min-1hr guest slot at the end of the session. If you want 
to get deck time, please show up as early as possible and plan to stay 
til the end. This keeps the rotation going smoothly. We are equipped 
with CDJs, turntables (not currently set up, let us know if you need 
'em), and lots of inputs for whatever other devices you might want to 
hook up.

When:
Tonight. 8pm-11pm

Where:
My house (near the Mission Dolores in SF). Highly MUNI-able (J line) and 
fairly BART-able (16th and Mission). RSVP for exact location. We also 
have a couple parking spots.

Why:
You like trance, you live in the city (or can get here), and you don't 
have anything better to do on a Tuesday night.

Stream & Podcast Info:
The stream will be available from 8-11pm PST at:
http://stream.tranceportal.org:8000
If you want a copy of the set, the recording will be available through 
iTunes or for direct download via tranceportal.org. This show will be 
released in 2 weeks.

Thanks!
Paul

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Hi, I'm trying to help this friend who has this continuous mix, and he  wants 
to add numbering by the track (without any audible gaps). Could someone  
recommend a program (whether free or pay) that can do this? He had the trial  
version of Soundforge, but it expired and I'm not sure if this is a feature that  
you'd find in shareware programs or if we'd have to buy something. No problem  
buying something, if people say it's good, but hoping to pay less than the 
$300  or so for Soundforge. 
thanks!
JonnyR

This is a feature of the CD burning software, not any audio processing.

There are MP3 splitters available out there, which take WAV files as well.
The secondary input is a CUE file that specify the track/split times.

Google around for audio splitter, there are plenty of one-off utilities.

 I do this by splitting up the track in something like audacity (free,
but annoying) or fission (cheap, mildly annoying) and then  burn the
individual tracks with the "gapless" option set in iTunes.

  I thought about buying roxio toast to do this, but couldn't see
where the value add was.

I'm all about Wavelab (Steinberg). It's also great for ripping samples off cds & creating loops too. Matter of fact I might even have a copy at home if you don't find anything by tonight. Let me know OFFLIST.

Hi Jonny,

You didn't specify how you want to play the set after it is split. 
Presumably you want to put it on a CD, in which case I'd recommend using 
Nero. SoundForge will let you export the timestamps to something that 
Nero can read directly, but you could use any audio player to generate 
those manually.

The other possibility is that you want to make a file with these cue 
points in it to play on your computer. We've used the Apple Chapter Tool 
to do this for our podcast. It works pretty well, but you have use the 
AAC format for the audio.

Best of luck,
Paul

I like using Nero for this as well.  It's real easy to use,
which is a plus in my book.

Subject: [sfraves] Oh yeah.. my interview w/ DJ Rap

So this is a segmant from the :code tv at Love Parade show that never got
editted... & like slowly, the other Executive producer/ edittor, Bruce is 
putting up the segments that we did do that day!

OK... b4 y'all watch this, I'm so like i'm gonna share a secret w/ y'all! 
Managers have alot to do w/ how the "interview" is programmed... like her
manager told me to ask "key questions" during the interview (which i
woulda asked anyway), but it was pretty much like that w/ all the DJs i
interviewed that day & their managers... lol... if my interview w/ Bad Boy
Bill ever sees the light of day, then you'll see what i mean 'cause his
manager got livid w/ me w/ 1 question I asked him... Hello 2day.. &
threatened to sue :code tv if we ever aired that interview...

Anywaze...ooh yeah... i was kinda sleep dep that whole day 'cause I only
ended up getting an hour sleep prior to going to staging that morning for
the BADNB float... so I wasn't me, but still was i guess :P  Hello 2day! 
Oh yeah.. you're gonna see the like 3rd or 4th take of the interview 'til
her manager felt it was right...

Enjoy :)

The only problem with most of these ideas is that you have to go through 
two more conversions MP3 -> wav -> MP3.  mp3directcut allows you to chop 
the mp3 up without those conversions.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The Twilight Years of Cap'n Crunch


That's why man invented Viagara

What makes me laugh is the number of people I find bringing it into the 
club.  Not a bottle either, we're talking a  half tab in the pocket 
loose.  Apparently its' the rage, especially with middle aged and other gay 
guys (any of you on the list want to confirm?  Danny?  *snicker*)  to pop 
one at the club before dancing to enhance the package while at the club....

Club drug policy being what it is, it's not allowed in, and it's rather 
funny to have somebody at the door argueing that "it's just viagara!"   The 
rule here is if you'e gonna bring it, make sure it's in a perscription 
bottle with your name on it from the pharmacy...

One time I told a guy, cause I was bored...

"Look, I'm not real comfortable with you bringing this in here.  For 
starteres, its' a drug.  I don't care what you want to call it, if you need 
a perscription, it's a drug.  If you don't have your perscription, then I'm 
not letting it in.  I would say the same thing about generic asprin that 
wasn't in teh bottle and I couldn't see Bayer on the tab.

"Sondly, I'm also not comfortable with you popping Viagara in teh 
club.  Might might as well have a loaded gun yin your pocket.  You're gonan 
feel it in there, all hard up again your skin.  An dyou'r egonna run it.  I 
mean, how could you NOT want to?  Then you're gonna have to go shoot teh 
thing off and that's just gonna be a big mess that I, nor the janitor 
really want to deal with.  If you really feel the need, and teh urge, just 
take it down to the shooting range...  you have a lot of choices...  Blow 
Buddies is a half block away, or go with the big boys and take a cab to 
Power Exchange."

I don't care who you are...  thats' funny.

(and I bet there's still people on this list that think I'm a complete 
asshole.... heh heh)

if you have a mac you can use amadeus which allows you to mark the  
track in different points and it will process the file and create  
seperate mp3 (or probably whatever format you want) files.  i don't  
know if mp3 direct cut allows you to do the same thing but it sounds  
like it and that's the easiest way to go, i think.  also, it will  
allow you to join files, which i sometimes have to do.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR:  advice on software to turn 1 mix into separate numbered tracks



You can do this with iTunes, and iTunes is totally
free!!

drop the long mix into iTunes, then right-click on it
and select "get info" and then go to the "Options" tab


In that tab, you'll find time values for "Start Time"
and "Stop Time"  set the values so that start is at
00:00.00 and stop is at the end of the first mix. 
then click "OK"

now, back in the iTunes playlist, right-click on the
mix and select "Convert Selection to MP3" (or whatever
format you want for your output, as set in the
Preferences>Advanced>Importing) and iTunes will render
down a copy of the section that you've specified.

Now, go back to the big mix and set the start for just
after the end of the previous stop (eg. of the
previous stop was at 3:45.06 make the next start at
3:45.07) and then set the stop for the end of the next
mix.

go back to the playlist and convert again and you'll
get a new file with the second track.

lather, rinse, repeat until you're all done, then set
up the tracks in the proper order in their own
playlist and set them for gapless playback.

if looking for actual helium tanks, any industrial gas place will have large
ones, most party supply stores will have smaller ones.

Today's quote is not of any one person.  I think it might have been
Ethan, who I'm not sure if he's on the list anymore or just a lurker,
but I remember literally YEARS ago when we used to have these threads
about promoters throwing parties where they maybe charged a lot of
money and there used to be this call to:

-- 

Open the books!

Anyone remember that?  Or better yet, have any of the old messages
from those days?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Some cool mods for the computer geeks

About 3-4 years ago I created a home media center PC using this case:

http://www.bettercomputers.com.au/product_info.php?cPath=77&products_id=260

(I got it for a lot cheaper then that by going straight to the
original manufacturer)

I then programmed the LCD to display song/artist track names and to
say "Welcome to the Osteen media center" when I first turn it on. I
also used large (slow) fans and suspended the drives using rubber
mounts to quiet it down. It has 5.1 DTS and also analog surround,
along with an ATI component or DVI connection to my 1080i HD tv (which
I bought cheap and with better quality using a tube tv). I tested out
a few different wireless keyboards and mice and finally got a decent
logitech setup, but would rather go RF when I can find a set up cheap
enough. I can watch videos/DVD, play games, music, winamp visuals, or
browse the internet in my living room in 32 inches. I use an ATI RF
remote, but prefer to just use a mouse. The only issue I have is boot
time, I wish I could figure out a way to speed up the boot time, I
used msconfig, but it is still at least 40 seconds.

Anyway, its great for parties because you can just set up a playlist
and put visuals on and leave it alone. It beats the hell out of those
manufacturer media centers.

Steve,

Bitchin! How long did it take to assemble? I've noticed msconfig doesn't stop a lot of processes from running in the background, perhaps those are causing some lag on your boot-up?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Three DJs fired after woman dies following water-drinking contest

A nurse called in during the contest and warned about "water intoxication".
The DJ's dismissed her warning by saying that the contestants signed wavers
and knew what they were doing. The woman who died complained oh a headache
and they told her it was just the water and encouraged her to drink more.

For those who don't know the excessive intake of water (>800mL per hour2)
can lead to a condition known as hyponatremia which is a result of a loss of
sodium concentration in the body. Excessive amounts of water in the
extracellular fluid act as a hypotonic solution relative to the contents of
the body's cells. Osmosis causes water to flow into the cell and sodium to
flow out. This difference in concentrations can cause the cell walls to
swell and rupture leading to the death of the cell. It becomes most
dangerous when there is movement of water into the brain cells which causes
neurological damage, coma, and death.

Does this remind anybody of a debate from several years ago about OD'ing on e? Didn't somebody die in England after drinking too much water at a rave one time? Seems to me that if anybody at the radio station did ANY homework at all, they would have found this contest to be quite dangerous. Fire all the fu*&^ers.

The DJ's dismissed her warning by saying that the contestants signed wavers
and knew what they were doing. The woman who died complained oh a headache
and they told her it was just the water and encouraged her to drink more.

For those who don't know the excessive intake of water (>800mL per hour2)
can lead to a condition known as hyponatremia which is a result of a loss of
sodium concentration in the body. Excessive amounts of water in the
extracellular fluid act as a hypotonic solution relative to the contents of
the body's cells. Osmosis causes water to flow into the cell and sodium to
flow out. This difference in concentrations can cause the cell walls to
swell and rupture leading to the death of the cell. It becomes most
dangerous when there is movement of water into the brain cells which causes
neurological damage, coma, and death.

They all have been fired. Even though wavers were signed by the contestants,
mega lawsuits are expected to be filed.

Any good raver worth his/her salt would already know that rather than E 
being the main cause of E related deaths, hyponatremia is typically the 
reason folks wind up dying, and therefore intaking that much water when u 
are NOT perspiring like mad (for any reason - heat, drugs, etc.) could kill 
you.

of a risk. Large volumes of sodium and other electrolytes are lost in
perspiration. Better to drink Gatorade.

Gawd I wish there were more of these events actually happening.. what is up 
with Harmony these days.. still packing in the masses into small ass venues? 
  I haven't seen anything out of them since I was last dosed by a "friendly" 
raver giving out arm massages with family juice?

Now that just about blows me away. Has anybody been following the fallout from the Paul Harvey broadcast the other day? Apparently he read some Urban Legend letter "from the mailbag" which has been dubbed racist as all hell, and rumors are flying he's going to get fired. Just curious if anyone else heard it. . .

"In an online recording of the show, the DJs can be heard making comments joking about people dying from water intoxication, even discussing a case in Northern California two years ago in which student Matthew Carrington, 21, died after drinking too much water during a fraternity pledge"

Sounds to me like being fired might be the least of their worries.  Dumbasses.

They all have been fired. Even though wavers were signed by the contestants,
mega lawsuits are expected to be filed.

Most times you're better off pouring the water over your head than 
guzzleing it.

Man I am trying so hard to decide on a setup..

Everything points to Vista running a connection to my XBOX360 and then 
streaming everything between.  The things is I want to burn digital surround 
7.1/5.1 off my Tivo and it seems like I need to have the digital recorder be 
adjacent to the tivo.

Anyone know how to integrate Tiva into a media center PC to offload 
recordings digitally and not using the crappy analog out?

Steve,

Bitchin! How long did it take to assemble? I've noticed msconfig doesn't 
stop a lot of processes from running in the background, perhaps those are 
causing some lag on your boot-up?

media center PC using this case:

http://www.bettercomputers.com.au/product_info.php?cPath=77&products_id=260

(I got it for a lot cheaper then that by going straight to the
original manufacturer)

I then programmed the LCD to display song/artist track names and to
say "Welcome to the Osteen media center" when I first turn it on. I
also used large (slow) fans and suspended the drives using rubber
mounts to quiet it down. It has 5.1 DTS and also analog surround,
along with an ATI component or DVI connection to my 1080i HD tv (which
I bought cheap and with better quality using a tube tv). I tested out
a few different wireless keyboards and mice and finally got a decent
logitech setup, but would rather go RF when I can find a set up cheap
enough. I can watch videos/DVD, play games, music, winamp visuals, or
browse the internet in my living room in 32 inches. I use an ATI RF
remote, but prefer to just use a mouse. The only issue I have is boot
time, I wish I could figure out a way to speed up the boot time, I
used msconfig, but it is still at least 40 seconds.

Anyway, its great for parties because you can just set up a playlist
and put visuals on and leave it alone. It beats the hell out of those
manufacturer media centers.

Subject: [sfraves] new to the area/list from minneapolis

Hey everyone, been lurking about a week after being tipped off to this
list via x|k of <http://www.wayfar.net/>. We're both big into ripping
dance beats on retro hardware and met playing @ blipfestival in nyc a
few months ago.

Anyway as the subject says, I'm new to the area and looking forward to
witnessing and contributing to some sound systems out here! Currently
I'm up to doing live pa as STARPAUSE or K9D rocking LSDj on gameboy
and piggy tracker on gp2x.

I also run a creative-commons-recordings label @ <http://mp3death.us/>
and put weekly creative commons focused mixes up as podcasts @
<http://gorehole.org/podcast/>. And for those of you familiar w/ the
demo scene, I'm a member of the Northern Dragons :)

Besides the music stuff, I'm looking for work in San Francisco. I've
been doing C++ development the past few years, interested in getting
into usability/interface design. So keep those random pass-alongs
rolling!.

see you around,
<3 j.ordan

I knew this question was coming and I wish I had something newer to
present but have been terrible about recording shows. This file is
from last easter and I've gone through two or three new live sets
since then. Things are always evolving but you'll get a taste of the
flava so have at it :)

<http://mp3death.us/mor/easterAtTheNomad/02_starpauseLiveAtNomad060416.mp3>

... first half is piggy tracker, second half is lsdj

Holt: I'll be checking out RS for sure, a friend of mine wanted me to
go gear shopping with him there so I was checking out the website.
It's awesome they're distributing faderfox gear stateside, when I got
my LV1 it was a courier hassle job!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Three DJs fired after woman dies following water-drinking contest

Not so much, really.

Hyponatremia is still mostly in the realm of extreme atheletes like  
marathon runners; and, apparently, people making asses out of  
themselves in fraternities or on the radio.  Overheating and  
dehydration are still much more common, immediate, and important  
hazards.  You shouldn't give up the water, just don't overdo it.

My own trick is to just bring with me a couple of fast food salt  
packets when I plan to be... well... not sober.  Dissolve one into my  
water bottle, and I'm set.  It's also encouraging that you see  
Gatorade, and the like, at parties a lot these days.  And even Red  
Bull is good for 200mg of sodium per.

The salt thing is that much extra important to me especially; not  
because I fear hyponatremia, but because my mom's half of the family  
has a history of *LOW* blood pressure.  I start to get dizzy and  
nauseous and crave salt fairly quickly when I'm exerting myself.  My  
mom's even worse... she can't even go outside (Granted... in the  
Florida sun...) for half an hour without having to go back in for  
something salty to snack on.

john

I thought that the "mysterious ecstasy overdose" case from the UK was  
the one that turned out to be the freak allergic reaction.  Some girl  
took her pill, and just dropped dead inside twenty minutes.  I'm  
pretty sure there was a case, in Colorado somewhere, that was  
definitely hyponatremia though.

i used to do the same thing with the salt packets.  except the packets
would usually get wet at the party somehow and then get ruined.

i have this really strange reaction to...stuff.  at some point, i just
can't retain any fluids and keep pissing it out.

the salt used to help.  gatorade does too.

I swear I need to have a whole quote of the week for this lady, I
listened to an interview of her the other night and she just cracks me  
up.  She kind of sounds like that soccer mom on the Vice City talk  
radio channel but she's a lot more liberty minded, especially around  
the right to own guns, which I used to hate, but now I'm saving up for  
one.  I hear back in the day, you know, the day day, like the early  
1800's day, you were practically required to own your own gun,  
especially if you were part of a militia.  Now the government wants to  
get rid of militias, I hear, and we know they're building camps for  
everyone, so enjoy!

Sorry for the multiple posts, but I just remembered I have an mp3 of
the last track I did on the gp2x @
<http://gorehole.org/piggySaveArchive/lgptBabe_by_starpause/lgptrender_babe_by_starpause.mp3>

The root directory has the .wav samples I used and a lgptsav.dat
project file if anyone wants to peek at the process, piggy tracker
also runs in windows :)

Better learn how to use that gun too.  Its funny to me how many people thin=

 What about that microwave pain cannon?  I suspect your little AK-47 won't =

n Iraq the populace was generally armed to the teeth, not only with convent=
ional firearms,  but also with explosives, rocket propelled grenades, missi=
les, etc.  They seem to have a good number of armed militias as well.  And =
we can see how well they are doing with that.  Organizing an armed resistan=
ce isn't as easy as it looks.=0A=0ANow the idea of putting 300 million or m=

 some history here for example in Stalin's gulags, but lets examine the rea=

Sorry for the multiple posts, but I just remembered I have an mp3 of
the last track I did on the gp2x @
<http://gorehole.org/piggySaveArchive/lgptBabe_by_starpause/lgptrender_babe_
by_starpause.mp3>

The root directory has the .wav samples I used and a lgptsav.dat
project file if anyone wants to peek at the process, piggy tracker
also runs in windows :)

We know that breathing can lead to death.  In all people that have died, 
accidents or otherwise, it's been found through extensive research that in 
ALL CASES the people that died were breathing right before death.

For the people who are the DYI types...

When I got sick earlier this month and fluuid and electrolytes were a 
serious concerns, the pharmacy reccomended this stuff called Hydralife.

It comes in ready mix packets, tastes pretty good.  Reccomends to mix with 
12oz water but I found that to be a bit strong and moxed a packet with 
16oz.  The packets are water proof unlike the salt packets so it would 
survive a night in your pocket and not get soggy.  You could also probably 
sprinkle small bits into a watter bottle to sip on for steady intake and 
fold up the packet and save the rest for later.

Comes in 4 packs per box.  Scored at Walgreens.

>From MBM:

This beat that the devil today...
Has nurtured and fostered...
Is inspired by the powers of hell!
And there are young people that are in these rock groups that are
pulling off their clothes in full view of thousands of young people.
There asks the question when police dare not step in with the air thick
with marijuana smoke, a hundred thousand kids! The huge speakers that
beat off the music as dope-filled entertainers and performers beat upon
the guitars and drums and the strings. Those young people that ripped
off their clothes and acted like animals...
They said it's the music
It's the music!
They said it's the music
It's the music!
They said it's the music
It's the music!
They said it's the music
It's the music!
And I really didn't know what I was doing, they said...
I just pulled off my clothes and I had to do it!
They said it's the music
It's the music!
They said it's the music
It's the music!
They said it's the music
It's the music!
They said it's the music
It's the music!

We all know its that funky ass devil music the kids are listening to these days.

Breaks really do kill.  ;)

The myth of life has also been debunked, as they have now found that 
conception is the leading cause of death.

Subject: [sfraves] promote yourself, or just have fun

hi all,
as i'm sure you all have seen in my signature, and various attempts at
promoting it myself, i run a podcast. from show to show i try to mix
up the selection, play various genres and styles and keep the show
progressing with new and unheard music. keeping up to date with the
latest tracks can be a pretty daunting task, especially when you're
working 9 hours a day and going to school three days a week...

that's where you come in. are you an aspiring musician, dj, producer,
remixer or music nerd with something you want the world to hear? if
you answer yes then i want to hear from you. i'm looking for guest
hosts to put together 30 minute free form sets (that is, a set made up

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

you bring up all some interesting points about owning guns, joining =20
militias, concentration camps, and your opinions on the quoted for the =20
day.  i've already heard about procedures that need to be followed =20
with firearms, and i intend to be well informed on all that when the =20
time comes.

i wasn't thinking of joining a militia any time soon, i am aware there =20
are many out there some less desireable than others.  it makes sense =20
there would be, just like it makes sense there would be proper =20
procedures for storing and using firearms.  i mean, doesn't it?  =20
common sense, right?

the armed militia in iraq, by the way, are being pitted against each =20
other with timed events like killing saddam hussein and having a =20
"hidden camera" (wink wink) in a way that is designed to create rifts =20
between the sunnis and the shiites.  the iraq war is a total success, =20
don't even get me started on that.  any idiot could watch that video =20
and see it was completely engineered.

camps are already being populated, this is a fact, look it up on the interne=
t.

by the way, extreme points of view was something that was the core of =20
Robert Anton Wilson's being.  have you even read any of his books, or =20
did you just throw a few links up with videos about him while you were =20
surfing the web with fox news playing in the background?  because, =20
quite frankly, that's the impression i'm getting.

i think it's good to stay informed, there's a lot of information out =20
there and there's a lot of opinion.  and there's a lot of out right =20
lies, too.  some of these people i have to immerse myself in for a =20
while before i decide whether i think they're worth my time.  and i =20
think everyone should be able to do just that, and have the confidence =20
in themselves they are a free thinking individual that has the ability =20
to form their own opinions.

oh, long post again.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

Yeah I've read some of his books back in college. The Illuminatus Trilogy, =
Gesture of Balance, and The Teachings of Don Juan,  were all pretty much re=
quired reading my freshman year at UCSC. Since I grew up in Berkeley, I had=
 read some of this stuff already in high school too.  Oh and Lovecraft and =
Dune and Tolkien and much more.   It would be a long list.  I used to hang =
out at Moe's on Telegraph when I was a kid.  Anyway, I read the Illuminatus=
 Trilogy and first Cosmic Trigger; my copies should be in the furnace room =
in my parents house in Berkeley.  I'll pull them out next time I'm over the=
re.=0A=0A =0A=0AFWIW, the author of this piece about RAW, Jesse Walker, is =
a friend of mine.    I think its worth a read...=0A=0A    =0A=0Ahttp://reas=
on.com/news/show/117878.html    =0A=0A=0A=0AOh and I think Jesse's probably=
 read some of RAW's books too.  =0A=0APersonally, I think you've entirely m=
issed the point of what Wilson has to say about conspiracies and conspiracy=
 theories, or "extreme points of view" as you put it.  "The Kennedy assasin=
ation. I was reading all the=0Acontroversial literature and I got to see mo=
re and more how everybody=0Ain that debate, on all sides, how they were adj=
usting the data to fit=0Atheir prejudices. So in Illuminatus, my first long=
 novel (in=0Acollaboration with Bob Shea) we gave a couple of dozen alterna=
tive=0Ascenarios and everybody in the book figures it out differently, and=
=0Athe reader has to figure out which version they're going to believe,=0Ao=
r are they going to become agnostic."  (http://www.excludedmiddle.com/wilso=
n%20interview.html)  =0A=0AThe point is to become agnostic, to stop being a=
 robot, to stop believing in things which aren't true.  Everyone is conspir=
ing and we're all conspirators.  Chaos and complexity are the result of all=
these interacting conspiracies.  Only delusional kooks and dangerous religi=

 "I don't believe anything, but I have many suspicions."=0A(http://hostgato=

 to read and form their own opinions.  That's why in my previous posts I've=
 provided the links to these people's own websites so everyone can easily s=
ee what they are really about.  Not everyone has time to search Google and =
find out exactly what sort of excrement you are posting to the list.  I wou=
ld strongly encourage everyone to read these people's own words and decide =
what you think of them.  I hope the links I post make that a bit easier to =
do.=0A=0A=0ABut let's cut to the chase.  Deepfog you are posting quotations=
 from white supremacists, racists, bigots, so called "patriots", and other =
miscellaneous ultra-right wing nuts to a rave list.  That's obviously a stu=
pid and pointless activity.  I'm just calling you out for doing it.  =0A=0A=
You can dress it up however you want, but that's the reality.  What makes y=
ou think this is a good idea?  Clearly the majority of people on this list =
don't and won't ever agree with the anti-gay rantings of someone like Devvy=
 Kidd.  There are a range of political leanings here, but I'd say that we c=
an safely assume that most people here don't share your interest in these p=
articular "extreme" viewpoints.  Also, it is fucking San Francisco remember=

I don't believe in a Zionist conspiracy.  I think that's too narrow.  =20

ongoing conspiracy to set up a one world socialist government dating =20
back to the days of George Bernard Shaw and the founding of the Fabian =20

it on them, but if you slowly work the world toward that way quietly, =20
one day there will be socialism and everyone will accept it.  They =20
work toward the idea that the things they do to institute this system =20
might not complete this in their lifetime.

This is sort of condensed in a nutshell and I don't have time to go =20

people to be aware of this stuff, whether or not they agree with it.

Ah, the Fabian Society.  Of course the part you've conveniently left out is=
 that the Fabians are often linked to the global Zionist conspiracy because=
 some of their members where Jewish and strong supporters of Zionism.  See =
for example Israel Cohen. =0A=0AYou see folks, in the wacky and wonderful w=
orld of "white power" it has now become clear that talking about hating Bla=
cks and Jews openly just isn't attracting the audience they need to support=
 themselves.  As a result some of these people have softened their presenta=
tions and they now talk about illegal immigrants, Zionists, Socialists, and=
 Marxists.  But the reality is the ideology they are propagating is still m=
ostly about hating Gays, Blacks, Jews, Mexicans, etc. and advocating violen=
ce against these groups.  These people have just developed new code words f=
or talking about it which they hope will avoid the attention of the authori=
ties and also attract a bigger audience for their ideas.  Don't be fooled.=

inese Cultural Revolution.  Sorry Deep Troll, it is complete nonsense to as=
sert that people won't accept socialism if they are forced into it.  In fac=
t the history of socialism and Marxism shows precisely the opposite with th=
e largest and most powerful socialist states regularly using extreme force,=
 torture, and imprisonment to get their populations to accept a socialist s=

 Why do you think that is?=0A=0AThis goes right to the heart of Robert Anto=
n Wilson's theories about conspiracies.  His point was that there isn't jus=
t one conspiracy, there are thousands, millions, or perhaps even billions o=

observe.  Watch the "I in the Pyramid" video I linked to previously in whic=

us Trilogy is not just a fun conspiracy novel, it is a method of deprogramm=

Does anyone in the city have a set of free weights they aren't using and 
would like to either sell (cheap) or loan out, or just plain give away?

Anyone? Bueller?

Thx,
Marco

Happy Friday 'yall. 

Just a thought. . .

I bought this Men's Health home workout bible that has all kinds of ideas for working out on the cheap. You can fill plastic milk bottles with water (or sand once you beef up a little) and pump those & do squats. Use a sturdy chair or couch to do dips which are just-as-if-not-more important. For about $15 bucks you can get a chin-up bar which IMHO is worth its weight in gold. If you're going to spend any cash, I'd recommend dropping it on a nice pair of running shoes with good cushioning. 

peace

chuck

I know nothing about these things. I'd like to get a unit that plugs into my cigarette lighter, but beyond that I have no idea about what's good or what features to look for. 

Would anybody be able to make some recommendations on a good system???

Thank you (much),

Chuck

Yeah, running is evil and bad for the body. I used to run cross
country in school and my knees have been messed up since. The best
exercise is swimming, but picking up a skateboard will do the job
also.

Sorry, don't have weights, I don't believe in "working out" my theory
on "working out" is that is energy that could be spent doing something
worthwhile like mowing lawns, fixing something, making something,
cleaning. You know stuff that is worth a value.

Just imagine if everyone that went to gym everyday spent that time and
energy doing something good for the community.

I've been eyeing the AVIC Z1, but its a double-din, full install system. I
don't want to have a device flopping around my dashboard with cables all
over the place.

It helps to play with the models to see what you like about their response
time, controls and such. This isn't something you want to fiddle with while
driving.

I'm investing in my body and keeping it fit. But that is silly long-term
kind of thinking, like those pesky IRA things.

Soo, what are you doing with your hour a day of community service?

Does anyone in the city have a set of free weights they aren't using and 
would like to either sell (cheap) or loan out, or just plain give away?

Anyone? Bueller?

Yeah dude, sign me up for the community program that works to erase 
obesity and teaches people to gain flexibility and endurance. Sounds 
like a great plan.

I wonder what we'd call a place like that...?

You don't need any weights- go prison style- fill buckets and bags  
with water.
Find some big rocks or cinder blocks.
And then when you're in solitary with no access to the ironpile?
You stand in your cell- and do burpees... *all day*.

Yeah- quite the finger workout typing that response I suppose.

Wow that would make a great short video- streetlifting!
The 7-11 trash can speed-empty!
The crackhead toss!
And the triple-bum-jump!

Yanno- you're right- come mow my lawn and clean up my house.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Odd question...

Well, I was saying that tongue in cheek, but... I guess it is somewhat
true, though I seriously don't have a problem with people working out,
it's just not right for me and my do-it-myself lifestyle.

For instance:
I have a 16 year old car that I never had to take to a mechanic
because I do all the maintenance and repairs myself. I have never
called a repair man for anything. My house is always clean (and I
don't do meth), I make a habit of planting poppy seeds where ever I
see fresh soil, my lawn, yard, and backyard are not a eye sore for the
community.

I'm not overweight (at least since I stopped eating fast food last October).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Need Advice, Car Navigation System

picked up the new Mio C310x from Fry's for $200... includes the new iGo nav 
software that is the "newer cheaper better" alternative to the others and 
purported even much better than TomTom6 although i haven't seen TT6.

includes 1GB of flash filled with US maps and POI internal but after 
cleaning out all but CA, NV, AZ and OR, i had 800MB free to fill with MP3s 
and after hacking to get at the underlying Windows CE, i loaded Nero Mobile 
7 on it and load MP4 movies onto another 2GB of flash i put in the SD slot.

oh, and i hacked in the British female voice since so i would feel at home 
having some bitch try to tell me what to do ;)

never had a gps before... i twas a whimiscal buy but after a few weeks with 
it, i find it indespensible.  comes with a windsheild mount and cigarette 
adatper for the car that mounts and dismounts easiliy to move from car to 
car... watched movies on it while waiting around all day at jury duty last 
week, played some games, etc.

this the one i got:

Peter H. Morse Jr.
	 	
Peter H. Morse, Jr. 36, a pioneer and leader in harm reduction policy  
and practice, passed away on January 13, 2007. Dr. Morse was fiercely  
committed to protecting the health and well-being of drug users and  
their communities by reducing drug-related harm. His work in these  
areas has helped make harm reduction part of public policy and public  
consciousness. As the Naloxone Distribution Program Coordinator for  
the Drug Overdose Prevention Education (D.O.P.E.) Project of San  
Francisco, Dr. Morse helped to forge a groundbreaking partnership  
with the San Francisco Department of Public Health to provide  
naloxone at needle exchange sites throughout the city. Naloxone is an  
opioid antagonist that counters the deadly effects of overdose by  
heroin or other opiates. Dr. Morse helped establish and advised  
numerous syringe exchange programs throughout the country. He has  
been a member of the advisory board of the North American Syringe  
Exchange Network since 2001. He was currently serving as the advisory  
board chair for the Homeless Youth Alliance, an agency that provides  
critical services, including syringe exchange, to homeless youth in  
San Francisco. He was a member of the Injection Drug User Taskforce  
of the California HIV Planning Group, and was appointed to the San  
Francisco HIV Prevention Planning Council Substance Use and  
Structural Interventions Committee. Dr. Morse currently worked as the  
Project Coordinator of the Harm Reduction Coalition Syringe Exchange  
Technical Assistance Program and was working to expand syringe access  
in California. He was a longtime volunteer at the San Francisco  
Needle Exchange, and before that at the syringe exchange of the Lower  
East Side Harm Reduction Center when he lived in New York City. He  
was also a member of the Moving Equipment Syringe Distribution  
Collective of New York City. Dr. Morse also worked as an interviewer,  
counselor, and project coordinator for University of California San  
Francisco's UFO Study, a hepatitis prevention focused health study of  
injection drug using youth. Dr. Peter H. Morse was born in Royal Oak,  
Michigan. He was educated at DePauw University, and received his  
doctorate in history from Binghamton University in 2006. In his  
research, he worked to understand the role of race and gender in the  
formation of political identity by members of radical industrial  
organizations in the United States during the early twentieth century  
He was an avid bibliophile and political activist, and was a member  
of the Bound Together Anarchist Book Collective. Dr. Morse was also a  
DJ, bringing electronic dance music to people in New York City, San  
Francisco, the Nevada Test Site, and Black Rock City, Nevada. Pete  
Morse is survived by his partner of 11 years, Liz Turner. The couple  
lived in Berkeley, California. He is also survived by his parents  
Pete and Patty Morse of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan; his sister Carrie  
Morse of Washington, D.C. and his brother and sister-in-law, Dan and  
Meredith Morse of Berkley, Michigan. A Service will be held on  
Saturday, January 20, 2007, at 3:00 PM, at The Sullivan Funeral  
Chapel, 2254 Market St., S.F. In lieu of flowers, please send  
donations to: Tenderloin Health/Homeless Youth Alliance, Attention:  
Mary Howe, P.O. Box 170427, San Francisco, CA 94117.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Odd question...

I clean my own house, fix my own truck, do all the yard work.  I'm a 
DIY kinda person..

but I also lift weights.  No amount of yard work can replace 
that.  You can always be stronger, have denser muscle mass, etc.

Hope You Saved Your Glow Stick
By SAM KNIGHT

LONDON

TO most people in Britain, rave is a memory, and a blurry one at =20
that. For four years at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the =20=

1990s, Britain=92s youth took to the fields, forests and warehouses, =20
took Ecstasy, wore some of the silliest outfits ever devised =97 like =20=

cricket hats, white gloves and gas masks =97 and ushered out =20
Thatcherism in a strobe-lighted haze of electronic music that shook =20
the ground they danced on.

Then Parliament passed the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, which =20
humorlessly characterized rave music as =93the emission of a succession =20=

of repetitive beats,=94 and gave police the power to shut raves down. =20=

That swiftly put an end to the scene=92s drug-induced violence =97 and =
to =20
the scene itself.

But if you happen to be in London these days, there are signs that =20
something like rave is stirring again.

=93The first time around, rave really seeped into the mainstream,=94 =
said =20
Carri Mundane, 26, a designer who was a child during the first rave =20
scene but kept the fliers amassed by her older brother. =93The music =20
was in the charts, and everything just became a little bit more =20
psychedelic.=94

This time, it=92s more insular. And it=92s different in other ways, too: =
=20
some of the music is rock, not electronica, and the scene is no =20
longer as defined by the twin illegalities of drugs and trespassing.

But a collection of young creative types are dressing up and making =20
music that unmistakably refers back to the garishness, the euphoria =20
and the escapism of 15 years ago.

In mid-December, the Klaxons =97 an indie rock band and the self-=20
appointed leaders of the scene =97 invited a pack of D.J.=92s, artists =20=

and other performers to play a final gig of the year under the =20
railway arches of London Bridge.

The location was the site of illegal parties in the early 1990s but, =20
in keeping with the more sanitized character of today=92s movement, is =20=

now a well-appointed nightclub with a bouncer, sofas to lounge on and =20=

$7 beers.

The music didn=92t sound like rave. Though tinged with electronica, the =20=

Klaxons and two other bands played stripped-back rock, not unlike =20
much of the music that has been in vogue in Britain the last few =20
years. And the dance floor was more of a punkish mosh pit, with lots =20
of shoving revelers, than a blissed-out, synchronized community of =20
dancers.

Still, there were glow sticks =97 a kind of waving coral reef of neon =20=

pinks, yellow and greens =97 and between acts, young men in leather =20
jackets nudged their way around the dance floor, offering Ecstasy. =20
Teenage fans wore reflective jackets, neon paint, sunglasses, beads =20
and whistles as they hurled themselves back and forth, up and down, =20
suggesting that if this wasn=92t rave, then it was certainly a somehow-=20=

related cousin.

Like the original, the new rave scene may be a refuge from reality. =20
Although neither incarnation of rave would claim anything as coherent =20=

as an ideology, there may be an echo of Margaret Thatcher=92s =20
frustrated youth among those experiencing the last days of Tony =20
Blair=92s Britain, said Tahita Bulmer, the lead singer of the band New =20=

Young Pony Club.

=93That spirit of contentment has faded,=94 she said, with the country =20=

vehemently opposed to the way the prime minister has handled the war =20
in Iraq. But it=92s when people are unhappy, she added, that =20
=93everything goes neon and gets exciting.=94

Ms. Mundane, the designer, who wears brightly colored clothing that =20
has made her an arbiter of rave fashion, said, =93What I like about =20
rave is the positivity of it, the fact that it is so utopian.=94

The rave renaissance may be a reaction to the country=92s dour =20
political state or to the tyranny of indie rock. =93There=92s only so =20=

much partying you can do to these shoe-gazing indie bands,=94 said =20
Jaimie Hodgson, a music journalist, referring to Britain=92s emo-heavy =20=

music scene.

Many participants say they are nostalgic for a movement they are old =20
enough to at least remember, even if they have not experienced it =20
themselves. Or perhaps they=92re just looking for an excuse to dress up =20=

and take Ecstasy, otherwise known as MDMA, a drug best known for =20
inducing a touchy-feely, sensation-inducing high.

The new rave scene is a small, tightly connected movement of artists, =20=

D.J.=92s, bands and partygoers forged in a series of warehouse parties =20=

that, beginning in 2003, were organized by a gang of artists called =20
the Wowow Boys, in New Cross, a ragtag neighborhood of students and =20
boarded-up buildings southeast of London Bridge.

As in the 1990s, the gatherings attracted newly formed bands that =20
were eager to create an environment =93where the specific aim was to =20
party, =93 said Jamie Reynolds, the bass player of the Klaxons.

Hence, the outrageous outfits: At a New Young Pony Club gig, Oisin =20
Butler, a psychology student who said he was starting a band called =20
Aids Baby, sat wearing a purple bow tie, a red cardigan and glasses =20
with Day-Glo frames and no lenses. His jeans were so tight there was =20
no room for his keys. =93You can wear anything, as long as it=92s odd, =
or =20
glittery, or neon, or is really disgusting,=94 he said.

At a popular monthly dance party in Islington, North London, people =20
are encouraged to download smiley masks =97 a throwback to the original =20=

rave scene and an Ecstasy reference =97 from a Web site. The event =20
started in 2003 with a party in an abandoned public bathroom; this =20
summer 3,000 people in fluorescent attended its Glade Festival.

The dance-music scene has been =93snowballing=94 for the last three =20
years, says the party=92s D.J. and promoter, who calls himself Saint =20
Acid. He added that his early events were mainly attended by people =20
in their 30s, wearing old clothes and looking to relive the dance =20
parties of their youth, but now the crowd is =93getting younger and =20
younger.=94

Mark Archer is half of Altern8, a riotous dance act last seen playing =20=

the violin in biological warfare suits in 1991. After 15 years of =20
relative quiet, Mr. Archer, now 38, played at the recent Islington =20
party and is enjoying the unlikely satisfaction of seeing a young =20
band, Trash Fashion, cover one of Altern8=92s old tracks.

=93If someone had told me 16 years ago that I would still be playing =20
now the same music I was then, and that rock bands would be covering =20
our songs, I would have laughed,=94 he said. =93All of a sudden rave has =
=20
become cool again. It=92s been a bit of a shock.=94

I Like this :)  Like i guess this scene is pretty underground 'cause
yeah.. when i was there.. al lmy Homies who i kicked it w/ when i was
there, they didn't know about it!!!  Like the only underground events that
went on, to my knowledge anyway, were the outdoor forest parties in like
the Yorkshire area...

hmmm.. can't wait to go back there & see what up w/ this! :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: BSP: New mix to download

Thanks Tim!  As I said, they were all things I had picked up at the Open 
Mind moving sale the night before (which has actually been extended 
until the 27th I believe.)  I just sorted them out a bit by sub genre 
and pressed the record button and went at it.  You can say I was 
definitely happy to find some gems in the stacks.  So if you're one who 
is fine with "digging deeper", it's worth your time. (Was there again on 
Fri and found some more gems.)

Thanks again!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] The Twilight Years of Cap'n Crunch

a lot of stuff that is very disturbing, and i don't have any of the =20
links memorized or stored anywhere, but i think a simple google search =20
of CPS child abuse or child protective services abuses are a good =20
start if you're interested in knowing more.  you can also watch the =20
cathy o'brien video on google video where she talks about the things =20
she wrote in her book trance:formation of america, which i'd like to =20
read, but a lot of the books i'd like to read aren't available at the =20
chain bookstores.  hmpf.

anyway, CPS is a big subject and cathy o'brien's claims are probably =20
easily refutable because they're all what she says happened to her =20
from a very young age and she came from a family with a generational =20
history of abuse.  but still, check it out for starters and see what =20
you believe.  don't take my word for it.  on the other hand, i would =20
understand if a lot of people here would rather just think about what =20
the next cool party coming up instead is.

but why not do both?

now getting back to john draper, you guys asking me to talk about this =20
stuff, i kind of don't want to think about it right now, it's even so =20
disturbing to me.  and i was looking at pictures of afghan kids =20
deformed from DU, that's even more disturbing.  but i think maybe i'll =20
just say that i'm sorry i even brought it up that john draper would be =20
a good candidate for CPS, because i don't even actually know the guy =20
very well and i don't think he's that sick of a person to get off on =20
these kinds of things.  and it's even possible he's just a victim of =20
the system.  once you're in it, it's easy to be picked on.

well i think i've maybe said enough here tonight and i'll let some of =20
you respond and tell me i'm promoting hate and world zionist =20
conspiracies or whatever you're going to say.  that's fine, i hope =20
there's some of you out there that maybe know i'm a little more =20
genuine than that and i care about people and would like to spread the =20
word about corruption so hopefully someone somewhere can avoid getting =20
caught up in it inadvertently.

anyway i smell like fuel been working on an engine i'm going to shower =20
now.  DF out

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

I've got another stellar Pat Robertson quote in the wings.  Not =20
enough, perhaps, for a quote of the week, but we'll see after Tuesday.

I can't remember if I told you guys the weirdest thing I have ever =20
done.  The vaccum cleaner story?

No?  OK, here goes.  So I was living at that EBF house back in the =20
day, car was not running at the time, and vaccum cleaner was in sorry =20
shape.  So I had Peter give me a ride to a shop, over by his house, =20
near a BART station, and I took BART home.  Came back, few days later, =20
the vaccum is ready to pick up.  Car still not running.  So I go, take =20
my happy self, and pick up the vaccum, and get on BART.

With a vaccum cleaner.  See where this is going?

So you know how things go, you get bored waiting for the train, and =20
then by the time you get on the train, you're bored waiting for your =20
stop, at least I do, so I was bored and decided to start vaccuming.  =20
Well, there are no obvious electrical outlets in the train cars, so I =20
just pretended I was vaccuming.  And there were about 7 people in the =20
car, I didn't really look at them, but they even moved their feet out =20
of the way so I could get under the benches.  What a riot!  Made the =20
stop come by a whole lot faster.

Moral of the story?  I don't know that there is one.  But what seems =20
to come to mind is if you look like you're doing something important, =20
most people won't question what you're doing.

I keep seeing Pat Robertson in a green and orange plaid suit on a
corner somewhere trying to sell you used hot dogs.

=0A=0AAs far as Cathy O'Brien and MK-ULTRA, the problem I have with her sto=

 her book either.=0A=0AMK-ULTRA was real and there were certainly abuses of=
 American citizens under this program.  Whether similar research continues =
is an open question.  Some people have theorized that the entire UFO phenom=
enon is a side effect of MK-ULTRA experiments testing the social and psycho=
logical effects of apparent alien encounters.  If you are interested n this=
 angle, look into Philip Corso who wrote a controversial UFO book, but was =
also deeply involved in the deprogramming of American POWs during the Korea=

i think reality tunnels and trying to discern from what is true and =20

might be its own reality tunnel.  you're right, what is real and what =20

well you may be right that i'm underestimating the intelligence of =20
people on the list.  now conversely, you might be underestimating my =20
belief that just because i listen to and agree with some of the things =20
jeff rense, devvy kidd, cathy o'brien, alex jones, etc.  doesn't mean =20
i buy every last thing they say, nor does it mean i'm a hateful racist =20
gay basher that believes everything is a conspiracy.

i guess i was kind of not understanding how you made that connection =20
in the first place, but i guess maybe i didn't explain myself well =20
enough.  in fact, i've never understood discrimination of any kind, =20
but i'm also convinced that the key to making people less racist and =20
bigoted is to let them air their anger.  most of them that i've =20
encountered personally usually start to see that for themselves when i =20
just listen but don't buy into the bigotry by egging it on.

the main thing is, i'm not afraid to be wrong.  in fact, in a lot of =20
cases, i'd rather stick my neck out there and be wrong a few times to =20
maybe learn something.

well no, i actually agree with you that a rave is a party with a =20
purpose.  now of course, i've met people that don't feel that way.

anyway, i have to run.  i'm sorry if i offended anyone with my =20
postings.  i hope the discussion was something in the end maybe a =20
positive thing where some of us learned things.  i know i did.

Beware the one cure fixes all. I happen to work in cancer research and can tell you that there is not just one event that causes cancer. There are many, many types of cancer and they all tend to behave differently.

Many people want to view pharmaceutical companies as suppressing a cure because it would not make them large sums of money. While it is true that some things are not pursued further because it does not make sense to invest millions of dollars in something that will not gain returns it is not wise to believe in a conspiracy of hiding medical truths. I have worked in this industry for a long time and can genuinely tell you that the people working on cancer research genuinely and scientifically are working towards medicines that treat many various cancers.

On that note, there was an article I read recently about AIDS in Africa. It was about how record numbers of people were dieing because they refused to take the drug cocktail provided to them because it made them sick. Instead there was this herbal concoction that was said to cure AIDS. The witch doctors, I think, believed this themselves all the while making money hand over fist. Now, while I don't think our system is perfect or the FDA is free of corruption it is much better than the rampant quackery that is occurring in Africa.

on the topic of cancer, and it's potential cure, earlier this month i
listened to an interview with carl zimmer where he discussed his
article "evolved for cancer" (sci. american, jan 2007):

"Norman E. Sharpless of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill genetically engineered mice to study the effect of one of these
proteins, called p16 (or, more properly, p16-Ink4a). He and his
colleagues created a line of mice that lacked a functional gene for
p16 and thus could not produce the protein. In September 2006 the
group published three studies on the mice. As expected, the animals
were more prone to cancer, which could arise when they were only a
year old. "

"But losing the p16 gene had an upside. ... They destroyed
insulin-producing cells in the pancreases of the animals. The normal
rodents could no longer produce insulin and developed fatal diabetes.
But the ones without the p16 protein developed only mild diabetes and
survived. The progenitors of their insulinproducing cells could still
multiply quickly, and they repopulated the pancreas with new cells. "

Now, while I don't think our system is perfect or the FDA is free of corruption it is much better than the rampant quackery that is occurring in Africa.

in a discussion this weekend someone brought up Kary Mullis and his
hypothesis that HIV does not cause AIDS. this idea was the basis for
at least one political policy in south africa:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabo_Mbeki#Controversies:_AIDS

although i haven't all of the related articles yet, one of the
observations was that the symptoms of malnutrition and starvation are
not dissimilar from the symptoms of aids.

So, did anybody on here make it to the house party in Noe Valley after Fix
at Shine?  Lee Coombs was there and rocked it.  The vibe was simply
indescribable.  I think a lot of you ended up going to the Evil Breaks
party, which I heard was a lot of fun!

I ran into Ranger upstairs in one of the bedrooms...it was nice to meet
him...wonder if he remembers?

When people are too vocal, you can't kill them, because it will draw 
attention to what they are saying and prove them right.  Kill them and they 
become a martyr.  If anything, the forces that be have to work to keep them 
alive, making sure that life and accidents don't happen to them.  Welcome 
to the world of intrigue.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR:  advice on software to turn 1 mix into
  separate numbered tracks


I've done it with Nero.  Very easy.

The only problem I had was that my burner requires that there is a 
manditory 2 second break between tracks 1 & 2.  My work around was to 
create a 1 byte air track to put in for track 1, then everything was fine 
afte rthat.

Nero breaks the mix into seperate song files.  Then you just tell teh 
burner not to put any spaces bretween tracks and it's pretty good.

Probably a better way to do it, but that's why i did with software I 
already had on my system.

You've got a few choices:

Pretty much boils down to what software and video you're running.  The ATI 
All in wonder internal solutions are some of the most tested and 
reccomended solutions.  What it all boils down to is ditching teh TiVO and 
building a dedicated machine to act as your PVR.  Amost most all of the TV 
Tuner Cards will have PVR capability, which in effect makes them run just 
like TiVO.

For you open source people look no further than 
http://www.mythtv.org/   DOn't like it? There's plenty of others out there.

I've seen some real nice cases designed as media center for home brew 
people, with your entire entertainment system being powered and ran from a 
dedicated PC.  Drop in a 500 gig drive for hours of storage, a nice 7.1 
Audigy X-fi sound card.  A lot of the new video card all have componet out 
on them, so all you need to do is get the signal in.

Subject: [sfraves] High Tech Soul -- Techno DVD doc

The movie is a documentary on the history of detroit techno. Has anyone 
seen the film? What are your thoughts on it, is it fluff or does it have 
something interesting to say? I found that its on Netflix so there it 
is, the top of my queue.

Information about the movie:
http://blackgrooves.org/?p=98

Preview:
US - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzTi_H1uSKs
Japan - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijhjpBZFtX4

I find the fact that the Japanese trailer is a lot better than the US 
trailer pretty funny.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RIP Disco D

i have some extremely fond memories of dancing to Disco D here in SF.

one night at 550 in particular.  he was playing in the back room.  i
remember i was partying with Osby and i met many people off the SFR
list that night, many who have remained friends throughout the years.

RIP.

As someone who suffers from bipolar...it's a bitch to grasp at times...and it sure scared off guys many times before...it's a scary feeling at times when you feel like no one can help you and my lowest seems to hit when no one is around which puts me in a state of mind that no one cares but i know that isnt true..it's a bitch of a battle and i continue to battle it everyday...as for help...i have tried many approaches from lithium to therapy...docs are always trying to get you on some sort of medication...but i rather deal with it directly...anywho...

it is sad to hear that dave is gone...he will be miss for sure...

I never met Disco D, but my ex-wife suffers from this disease.  And although she seems to be doing sort of OK right now, it wrecked our marriage, seriously harmed our children, and to a very large extent has wrecked her life as well.  In my experience it is much often more serious and difficult to deal with than people seem to think.   

If someone you know or love is suffering from depression or bipolar disorder don't ignore it, get some help.  In my own case, at the time I didn't understand the nature of my ex's illness at all.   I just thought she was a bitch.  

Bad things happened as a result.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More White Power BS on SFRAVES...(was QOD)


I thought is was pretty muh a given that the civil war was about 
confederacy attempting to suceed from the Union, and the Union opposing 
that move.  Many issues were involved in why those states wanted to leave 
the union, Slavery being one of them, but the bottom line reason was that 
they didn't want to be part of the federal gov't and the federal gov't said 
"tough shit".

It's not much different any other country that splits in half and the sides 
start fighting over territory.  There's various issues, and individuals 
(Lincoln for example) will have their personal opinons on those issues, but 
going to war over them is another issue.

Afte rthe civil war the 14th and 15th ammendments were passed, both of 
which moving the country towards being more civilized and was one of the 
smarter things our gov't has done in it's history.  IMHO if the north was 
serious about the issues, they would have passed those ammendments or at 
least made them a law previous to the war.  IMHO the ammendments were 
passed in the same light as a campaign promise made good.  It's 
speculation, but based on general political movites, it pans out.

As for the use of the word perverted, it very easily could have been used, 
since it's meaning was different back then.  Pervert is taken form the 
latin word "perverto perverti perversum" which literally means "to turn 
upside down, overturn, overthrow."

Considering most of our educated leaders were versed in Latin, this is the 
way I interpret it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More White Power BS on SFRAVES...(was QOD)

I'm no historian, but your description matches essentially matches my under=
standing of those events.  However, it always seems questionable to me to s=
tate what any war is really about in one sentence or less.  How can you det=
ermine what a war is really about?=0A =0AFrom what I read this AM in Lincol=
n's speech, it is clear that there were already concerns about what he migh=
t do with the Southerner's "property" which, as a reminder happened to incl=
ude human beings, since he specifically addressed this issue in his speech.=
 He specifically says he won't free the slaves, so I assume he felt that he=
 needed to address this because some feared he would.  As you correctly poi=
nt out he didn't do that until after the war.=0A =0AIt also wasn't decided =
until after the war (in the 14th amendment) that slave owners would not be =
reimbursed for their losses due to the freeing of their slaves.  Therefore =
to say the war was really about harming the South economically when this wa=
sn't decided until after the war seems highly questionable to me.  Possibly=
 the slaves could have been freed and their former owners reimbursed for th=
eir losses had the South not seceded in the first place.  Maybe not, I wasn=
't there.=0A =0AFWIW, and fior the sake of completeness I'm happy to report=
 that after a bit of further research I've found the original source of thi=
s quotation,  in the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858.  (http://www.nps.gov/=
archive/liho/debates.htm) =0A=0AFWIW here's the full quotation in context:=
=0A =0A"I say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery in=
 the States where it exists, because the Constitution forbids it, and the g=
eneral welfare does not require us to do so. We must not withhold an effici=
ent Fugitive Slave law, because the Constitution requires us, as I understa=
nd it, not to withhold such a law. But we must prevent the outspreading of =
the institution, because neither the Constitution nor general welfare requi=
res us to extend it. We must prevent the revival of the African slave-trade=
, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial slave code. We must prevent=
 each of these things being done by either congresses or courts. The people=
 of these United States are the rightful masters of both congresses and cou=
rts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who perver=
t the Constitution.=0A=0ATo do these things we must employ instrumentalitie=
s. We must hold conventions; we must adopt platforms, if we conform to ordi=
nary custom; we must nominate candidates; and we must carry elections. In a=
ll these things, I think that we ought to keep in view our real purpose, an=
d in none do anything that stands adverse to our purpose. If we shall adopt=
 a platform that fails to recognize or express our purpose, or elect a man =
that declares himself inimical to our purpose, we not only take nothing by =
our success, but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle than =
a desire to have 'the loaves and fishes,' by which, in the end, our apparen=
t success is really an injury to us."=0A =0Ahttp://www.bartleby.com/251/pag=
es/page494.html=0A=0AIf you are interested, I'd advise going back a few pag=
es to read this in the full context of his entire speech.=0A=0ASo Griffin d=
id almost quote Lincoln correctly, though not accurately word for word, but=
 he's conveniently omitted the context in which it was said.  He's actually=
 arguing for the rule of law and against secession and armed rebellion here=
 I think.  He's arguing for practicality too.  Doing what needs to be done =
to win, rather than impractical idealism about freeing the slaves.  At leas=
t that's my interpretation.  YMMV.=0A =0APeace,=0A =0APeter=0A =0A=0A=0A---=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More White Power BS on SFRAVES...(was QOD)

Lalalalala. I agree with Shatter's e-mail. From my understanding of
the civil war it was not about slavery, but it became about slavery
afterwards during reconstruction. Also, a lot of people started making
it about slavery once the civil rights movement took place in the
50's/60's and changed the whole meaning of the war.

This discussion has nothing to do with "white power BS" since it is
only about factual history and I'm pretty sure no one here is pro
slavery and all racism (even against white people) is ignorance.

Therefore to say the war was really about harming the South economically when this wasn't decided until after the war seems highly questionable to me.  Possibly the slaves could have been freed and their former owners reimbursed for their losses had the South not seceded in the first place.  Maybe not, I wasn't there.

But we must prevent the outspreading of the institution, because neither the Constitution nor general welfare requires us to extend it. We must prevent the revival of the African slave-trade, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial slave code. We must prevent each of these things being done by either congresses or courts. The people of these United States are the rightful masters of both congresses and courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.

If we shall adopt a platform that fails to recognize or express our purpose, or elect a man that declares himself inimical to our purpose, we not only take nothing by our success, but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle than a desire to have 'the loaves and fishes,' by which, in the end, our apparent success is really an injury to us."

He's actually arguing for the rule of law and against secession and armed rebellion here I think.  He's arguing for practicality too.  Doing what needs to be done to win, rather than impractical idealism about freeing the slaves.  At least that's my interpretation.  YMMV.

What I don't understand is the difference between the 8pm show and 11pm 
show. Does the purchase of the 8pm show allow you to get into the 11pm 
show? Does one go all night, or does the whole thing end at 2AM?

I think i'll write an email.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Speedy J on Saturday?

Just called the guy on the site.

So both timeslots are pretty much pre-assembled sets that they've worked 
on prior. So both shows should be similar in length and tone. Is there 
anything going on afterwards that would compel me to go to the earlier show?

Just wanted to refute this:

"and I'd suggest further that those that promote racism are both ignorant
and afraid."

never underestimate the intelligence of someone who has been able to
manipulate youth, i.e. :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Metzger
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Front
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Girnt_Butler

etc.

these people are not ignorant by any means, just sick twisted fucks.

i would argue on the whole civil war/slavery issue, but i was born and
raised in the south and i've seen compelling arguments on both sides. point
being, who gives a shit, it's not like we're going to start the slave trade
back up now that it's cheaper to have it automated(i.e. the cotton gin and
several other inventions would have killed it anyways, regardless)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More White Power BS on SFRAVES...(was QOD)


Wars are NEVER about a single issue, there is always ulertior motives.

My statement was more towards the political and constitutional reasons 
behind the war.  Lincoln was first and foremost a believer in "United We 
Stand" and as such, splitting the union would be one of the worst things to 
happen to the country.  If you go back farther to the Federalist papers and 
such, you'll find a lot of talk about theevil of Factions, which is 
essentially what the confederacy was all about.  It was a Faction that 
didn't agree with teh Union, and therefore would be a seperatists and form 
their own nation, with currency.  Anyone who invested in Conferderacy Bills 
lost quite a bit of money in that bank.

The extended quote you posted is VERY good, as it's showing exactly my 
point about the war, motives, and legalities.  The ideas of hindering or 
helping.  Allowing but not encouraging.  Existing without growing.  Lincoln 
opposed Slavery.  This can't be argued.  However could he launch a war 
against the south on teh general principal?  No.  Slavery was not illeagal 
or unconstitutional.  Might as well have a President launch a war against 
the farmlands for use of a Tractor (which at that times was the same as a 
slave).  As previous to the ammendment, Black's wern't even counted as a 
whole person for reasons of census and voting.  Remember also that at the 
time, all men did not get an equal vote, but the LANDOWNERS that got a 
vote, with the amount of slaves owned giving additional votes for that 
landowner.  This was all constuitutionally legal.  (This all also makes for 
great arguments when people say we need to reinstate our original costitution!)

Thus, the civil was was fought on the basis that the southers states formed 
a Faction with the intent of seperating and forming their own independent 
nation, away from the United States.  Everything else regarding the war 
were details and pork barrel concerns.  It wasn't the slaves per se, but 
the concept of slavery, and states rights over federal rights.

If you study constitutional history (very facinating imho) you will see the 
basis of all aspects of our government, both state level and federal.  Why 
we have two Senators and a bunch of reps.  Senators are representative of 
the right of the states, all states being equal (100 total) and the 
Representatives are to represent the people, based on population 
density.  Under the Articles of conferation (1776) the states were VERY 
autonomous, printing their own currency, having their own laws, and 
such.  It wasn't until the Constitutional Convention (1789) that the 
Constitution was drafted because the Articles just wasn't working.  Quite a 
bit of the writing from the constitution can be found in the Federalist 
papers which were written by the Founding Father under various pen 
names.  They also borrowed quite a bit from John Calvin and Thomas Hobbs 
(Leviathon specifically).

The south felt that States autonomy wasn't being properly represented, in 
regards to the Slave Trade.  They wanted to do as they liked.  In truth, 
this could have been anything trades or prodiced, and included those as 
well such as suger, cotton, grains, etc.  They didn't like the Taxes, 
Tariffs, trade restrictions that were being imposed.    They felt the 
Federal Gov't was over stepping it's bounds.

The honest truth was that they had come to become so dependent on Slave 
labor that the entire economy would have shut down without it, and you can 
draw several lines between this and the migrant worker situation of today, 
and our reliance on foreign made goods from 3rd world nations and China.

Lincoln was no fool, and that's why in the quote he even stated that 
stopping slavery wasn't the concern, but preventing it's EXPANSION was.  To 
complete abolish would cayse a major economic depression.  Continued 
expasion would only cause a greater relience and dependence on it, so it 
had to stop, however it had to stop in an accorded and planned method to 
transition out of itm which is what they're always talking about when they 
say "Greater Good"


*sigh*  ya, I can go on for hours about this stuff....     ;)

The problem I think that's being really adressed is that there, in recent 
years, has been a problem with "Revisionist" history, in which people put 
out books attempting to change our view of history.  Books that demonize 
the founding fathers (Jefferson and his slave relations) or discredit them 
(Lincoln was gay!!  OMG!  Who cares!) and such.

you had some different history lessons than me, I guess that explains 
a lot, really.

I didn't learn that the Civil War was all about slavery - it was 
involved certainly, but the north passed laws allowing it's 
industrial center to grow and prosper, and not the farming that was 
going on in the south.  Slavery wasn't an accepted practice in other 
countries at the time, but we needed the war to put those ornery 
southerners in their place.

Hmmm what's wrong with "white power"?
Or "white pride"?
Or "asian power"?
Or "asian pride"?
Or "black power"?
Or "black pride"?

Remember in the 70s when those black athletes held their fists high  
on the olympic podium, signifying black power?
Imagine if those athletes had been white, and instead of a clenched  
fist their fingers were outstretched...

I think you see the double standard.
I will fight to the death for the right of *all* races and groups, to  
have pride in themselves and advance themselves.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More White Power BS on SFRAVES...(was QOD)

And I was merely correcting your use of the term-

If they are white supremacists, call them as such and be prepared to  
back up what you claim.
But "white power" has nothing to do with "white supremacy", and it's  
people like you who interchangeably equate the two that reinforce the  
atmosphere where a white person can not show any sort of pride in  
their race without it being construed as "racist" and "hate".

Nathan,=0A=0AThanks for the correction then.  =0A=0AMaybe I should have use=

 the guests are members of such groups.  These groups not only advocate whi=

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

I haven't looked at the SFR posts this week, maybe out of fear of =20
being flamed from my post yesterday.  Well, hopefully not.

Anyway, I was having an interesting little conversation last night, I =20
was working late and smoking, and talking with this guy and he was =20
talking about what he does at home and how he has the kids watch some =20
TV and stuff and then I mentioned how I don't really watch TV anymore. =20
  By the way, I stopped watching so much TV after listening to Alex =20
Jones interview Jeff Rense and they talked about how studies show that =20
TV puts your brain to a low sleep state, but that's beside the point, =20
it's good we had those debates the last few weeks.  I'll leave that =20
one alone for a while or at least for a while.  I want to talk about =20
rubber chickens.

Yes, my friend Tony joined us and listened to our conversation.  This =20
other guy I was talking to mentioned how he reads a lot and how his =20
kids get bored with TV and just go play by themselves or they talk or =20
interact.  I also mentioned something else I heard on that interview =20
that I thought interesting, that is 50 years ago, people used to talk =20
to each other at night, you'd hear fights going on in cities in =20
apartments, etc.  and now all the windows glow blue.  Now maybe that's =20
a little extreme and I'm pretty sure a lot of the SFR crowd already =20
doesn't watch so much, and it was mostly my problem, and I've gone =20
through stages where I don't watch any TV basically because there =20
isn't one around, for the first time now I go home and I actually =20
don't even turn the thing on because it's no longer interesting to me =20
at all.  I'd rather do other things.  I even used to leave it on =20
during regeneration cycles but I don't even do that anymore.

So we talked about the book Mayan Prophecies and that movie Apocalypto =20
and the other guy I was talking to mentioned it's hard to know what to =20
believe, and I made that comment that history is written by the =20
victors, and my firend Tony popped in with his little comment that I =20
would like to dedicate as today's QOD:

--

Yea, that's because when I write my book, I'll be whoopin some ass!

--

... and then he started talking about how rubber chickens are the =20
shit.  This guy claims to have been a bouncer for raves in the NW and =20
says he's heard the name Groovinkim before.

Anyway, guess you had to be there, have a nice Thursday, talk to you soon.

DF out

Well, we just begain Monchis' set about 25 minutes ago, and have already 
had a bunch of people calling in requesting copies, so this is someone 
you probably don't want to miss.  We're going until noon, and I hope 
that he can stick around until then.

I believe he'll be taking us through the house, and progressive house 
realms, dipping into some electro happiness every once in a while. 
Great stuff overall!

So tune in, 90.1 FM in the bay area or online at 
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu (check out the sweet AAC stream there.)

Thanks for listening!

Everything. This is the basis of racism. People that have ethnic pride
automatically segregate themselves and put their race higher then
other races. Self-segregation is a major cause of modern day
discrimination.

What if everyone had national pride instead of ethnic pride?

Perhaps you should explain it to the goose stepping aryans marching around 
with pictures of Hitler chanting WHITE POWER.

As for White Pride, they are a subset of WAR (White Aryan Resistance) and 
are for all practicle purposes a gang not unlike the bloods or 
crips.  They're more concentrated in suburb areas, at least in 
california.  Pretty much the recruiting grounds for the upper ranks of the 
organizations.

The concept of pride in ones self is fine, however let's ot forget it's one 
of the deadly sins, and for good reason.  Humility is the better part of valor.

Basing your pride on a color is, well, really fucking lame.  It's 
racial.  Plain and simple.  Please note, I didn't say Racist, I said 
Racial.  What has a race done?  Nothing.  Not a fucking thing.  Races 
breed.  Culture on the other hand, grows, develops, advances, suffers 
through hardships and either is wiped out, or excels.  I can go on at 
length about this, but i shoudl have to.  This list SHOULD be smart enough 
to easily draw their own examples.  Pick any race, and you can find it's 
winners and losers, however if you find the difference between the winners 
and losers, the divideing lines will be culturally based, because when 
looking at a race, there's no lines of division within that race.  Simple 
logic.

Pride of culture, pride of country, pride of history.

Not pride in genetics.

Fuck Racism.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - This week's Fukwerk & Low End (feat. Japan's Saya Sat @
	Retox Lounge!)

Thanks to all of you who have been coming out these past few weeks to
Fukwerk Friday at 111 Minna and especially those who made our first
night at Low End Saturday last weekend a memorable sweaty, freaking
blast!

We can't wait till this weekend to do this all again with our favorite
techno lineup. And that's a good thing, cause there's little time left
to recover.

This week at the Low End Saturdays catch our special guest DJ Saya
from Tokyo, along with residents James Bass and the Solekandi Duo.

Don't forget to drop by 111 Minna Friday for Fukwerk for the best end
of the week happy hour dance party in the city. The Solekandi duo and
Peoplemuver's Kawa will do the after work unwinding for you.

More details on both events Friday and Saturday below:

Fukwerk Friday
111 Minna (2nd and Howard)
DJs: Bay Area Beatdrop residents The Solekandi Duo and Kawa (Peoplemuver)
Time: 5-9 PM
$1 drinks from 5-7
No Cover

===========================================================

Low End Saturdays
Retox Lounge (628 20th Street @ 3rd St)
DJs: Saya, Solekandi Duo, James Bass
Time: 9-2 PM
No Cover

About Saya:

Saya, who originally hails from Japan, was a regular in Tokyo's techno
scene, throwing her own events and playing with some of the world's
best techno DJs such as countrymen Ken Ishi and Fumiya Tanaka, plus
Detroit's Jeff Mills and Claude Young. Saya's tight blend of danceable
yet minimal tech grooves reminiscent of Japan's Op.Disc crew have
definately caught our attention with both a skillset and track
selection that's worthy of an entire Saturday night on the Retox
dancefloor.

Review of Low End @ Retox in this week's Nitevibe:

"Shh, don't tell anyone, but Retox, home of the old Sublounge, is
turning into one of the hottest out-of-the-way haunts in SF. The new
ownership has done wonders for the space, and the quality of the beats
is matching that of the drinks as Bay Area Beat Drop brings the sounds
that a discerning ear will desire. Solekandi and James Bass like to
drop bass-heavy love, and special guest DJ Saya is a treat for sure.
(SG)" (Nitevibe)

Come pay your respects to the late Disco D tonight at Compression,  
one of D's favorite parties to play at in SF. This will be a low key  
night in which you can bring a white candle, flowers, a picture, CD,  
or anything else that reminds you of D to display on a little alter  
in his rememberance. Disco D was an incredibly talented pioneer and  
producer in the music industry working with people such as 50 Cent,  
Kevin Federline, the international Brazilian hiphop group Braza, and  
numerous other artists. He was one of the first musicians to truly  
expose Ghetto-tech and he has melted numerous genres of music  
together to make some incredibly talented beats. He was loved by all  
those who knew him, so come down tonight to pay your respects.

THE CELLAR
685 Sutter @ Taylor in SF
10PM

For more information about Disco D, visit discod.com, youtube.com,  
myspace.com/gringolouco
For more information about his death, visit the Jan 22 & 23 news  
archives of mtv.com, urb.com, & xlr8r.com, just to name a few.

DISCO D YOU WILL BE MISSED HOMIE! WE LOVED AND SUPPORTED YOU SO MUCH  
AS YOU GOT US SHAKIN OUR ASSES ON THE DANCEFLOOR ONE GROOVE AT A  
TIME! MUCH LOVE!

So it's ok to group people based on some imaginary meaningless line  
you draw on the ground (nation), but it's not ok to group people by  
very real, meaningful things-  their culture, traditions, beliefs,  
behaviors, ancestry, and anthropological traits (race)?

Some funny logic you've got going there...

A nation is not based upon a meaningless line drawn on the ground.
Think about it.

I must not be smart enough to understand this simple logic, because  
my train of thought keeps getting derailed every time I try to  
understand what you just said.

My turn for some simple logic:

Pride in your parents: (mom and dad) OK
Pride in your family's in-country lineage: (iowa, california) OK
Pride in your family's out-of-country national ancestry: (germany,  
norway) OK
Pride in the accomplishments and culture of the nation of your  
family's ancestry (german and norwegian culture): OK
Pride in the accomplishments and culture of the nations and peoples  
surrounding the nation of your family's ancestry (european culture-  
aka "race"): UH OH- SUDDENLY NOT OK!

Also, I find it amusing that your name is the past tense of "shitter" :P

Of course it's not- the point was rhetorical, which I guess you missed:

race: "culture, traditions, beliefs, behaviors, ancestry,  
anthropological traits"

nation: "culture, traditions, beliefs, behaviors, physical proximity"

So again- it's ok if I divide on physical proximity, but not if I do  
so on ancestry?
(and the anthropological traits inherent in said ancestry derived  
from evolution)
Still the same funny logic...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More White Power BS on SFRAVES...(was QOD)



i think everyone has stuff to be proud of.  that stuff
might be related to your culture (eg. your day-to-day
living practices, etc.), it might be related to your
nationality (eg. what flag you salute), it might be
related to an ethnicity (eg. what group of people you
identify as "us") or it might be realted to your race
(eg. your genetic makeup).

the problem is when that pride couples with the ego
and makes you think that any one particular
culture/nationality/ethnicity/race is better or worse
than the others.

they key to harmony is understanding and appreciating
the differences that we all have, and then using those
differences as a point for sharing rather than as a
point for oppression.

something that's always irked me is hearing caucasian
folks say, "I'm just white."  *just* white?  so,
because you're white you don't have any cultural,
ethnic or other parts to you?  

this was actually the one good thing that came from
the time i spent in Detroit.  out there, i met and
worked with a bunch of 2nd and 3rd generation
caucasion immigrants.  these guys would bring differnt
cultural and ethnic foods to work for lunch during the
week, and would often share stories that their
families had handed down for generations, talk about
cultural music etc. etc. etc.  

all of these men were very in touch with their ethnic,
cultural and racial identities.  none of them would
have self-identified as "just white."  but they were
open and interested in sharing with other people, and
they didn't think they were better or worse because of
who they were.

i wound up having a very wonderful cultural exchange
with these guys, and yes, it was racial, ethnical (?),
national and cultural.  but no one was afraid to share
what they had, and no one was afraid to accept what
others were sharing.

just don't be afraid, brothers and sisters.  don't be
afraid to share, and don't be afraid to let others
share with you.

PLUR, right?

You also can't forget about "Team Lush".  I was the "Captain"
of this all-girl drinking team, most of whom probably shouldn't

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: More White Power BS on SFRAVES...(was QOD)

I was going to say Race !=3D Culture, but the dictionary is much more=
 forgiving:

=97Synonyms 1. tribe, clan, family, stock, line,=20
breed. Race, people, nation are terms for a large=20
body of persons who may be thought of as a unit=20
because of common characteristics. In the=20
traditional biological and anthropological=20
systems of classification race refers to a group=20
of persons who share such genetically transmitted=20
traits as skin color, hair texture, and eye shape=20
or color: the white race; the yellow race. In=20
reference to classifying the human species, race=20
is now under dispute among modern biologists and=20
anthropologists. Some feel that the term has no=20
biological validity; others use it to specify=20
only a partially isolated reproductive population=20
whose members share a considerable degree of=20
genetic similarity. In certain broader or less=20
technical senses race is sometimes used=20
interchangeably with people. People refers to a=20
body of persons united usually by common=20
interests, ideals, or culture but sometimes also=20
by a common history, language, or ethnic=20
character: We are one people; the peoples of the=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Desperately seeking loBudg / Carbon Community / S.O.T.E.G sets live / streamed, anything please :-))

we used to have a recording online of the first time Lobudg played in
the bay area, way back at Furious 2 in 2005.  it's not online anymore,
but i've got it on my computer somewhere.

Bil and Dave rarely play live together as Lobudg.  i think Evil Breaks
is the only crew that's had them play in the United States and we've
had them here 3 times!  woo!

there are a few of their individual sets online.

http://www.mnvibe.com/php/event.php?action=view&eventID=1896

http://www.podcastdirectory.com/podshows/321869

Addictech sells Bil's tracks and there is a mixed CD up there, as
well.  It's under "The Disciple's Grin" which is another one of Bil's
monikers (other than SOTEG, Son of the Electric Ghost, and SST).

http://www.addictech.com

Search for Bless records, Bil's own label.

Dave has a full length album of material that he's supposed to be
releasing.  but he's dragging his feet.  i've heard most of it and
it's good stuff.

hope this helps!

Gads, I see your point now!  How could I have been so stupid!

I, as a white person should be proud of the changes in the Soviet Union 
over the past 15 years that the Caucasian peopel have plighted for.

*laugh*

You are funny.  Where you live, and who you live with is far more reason to 
have pride.  As I said, I think pride is rather stupid to begin with, but 
if you must have it.  All pride does is lead to a bunch of self 
congradulatory marches, parades, rallys, shouting into megaphones, and 
going out of your way to point out why you're bette rthan the person next 
to you, and show how different you are.

.... and yes, I'm glancing towards to gays on this as well...  you're just 
as guilty.  The day we have a HETRO-PRIDE parade is when I will be quite.

but I'm digressing...

No, celebrating the accomplishments of Europeans is not "White 
Pride".  There's quite a few european blacks.  I even have some friends in 
UK that are Chinese by geneology but born and raised on UK.  What are 
they?  Do they have "White Pride" in their Euro Heritage or "Yellow Pride" 
because of genetics?  Hmm?

See...   Keep dividing those lines on skin color.  Keep the hate alive!

>Also, I find it amusing that your name is the past tense of "shitter" :P

Hows it feel not be the first person in your family to gradute the 8th grade?

Btw- the "Shitter" joke was original when a 12yo popped off with it on a 
BBS in '87.  It tends to be the first line of attack and ignorant troll 
slings in my direction, much like point out that Cyrano de Bergerac has a 
large nose.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tonal: Electric Blue underground this Sat w/ Q-Burns Abstract Message!

So I'm unfamiliar with several of these DJs.

Am I going to get jackin dance all night house music? Or am I going to
soulfully groove myself to sleep on the dancefloor? I perused some of
qbam's links and it all sounds very sunday morning. and not 3am sunday
morning but 1145 sunday morning. Which isn't necessarily bad, but. I
wanna know what i'd be getting into here.

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper into
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that
make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking trainspotters lose their
shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. He
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  With
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during that
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to head
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb
monthly parties. Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

TIM XAVIER

Tim Xavier made himself a household name for techno fans in the late 90s
with his innovative releases on Blueline, and since he has continued to push
the envelope with new sounds and ideas. His techno releases have been
consistent and solid, having signed work to major labels such as Default,
Advanced and PV. He has been featured on CD compilations by well known
techno artists such as Chris Liebing and Christian Wunsch, and his tracks
get repeated play by top names such as Luciano, Pan-Pot, Richie Hawtin,
Magda, Marco Carola, Troy Pierce and Adam Beyer.

More recently, he has expanded his talents and broadened his production
spectrum into the minimal genre, starting two new labels in 2005: LTD400 and
Klickhaus. LTD400 is his solo label featuring his own work, and the releases
have been featured on mix compilations by Ricardo Villalobos and Steve Bug.
His new project, Klickhaus, will feature his own production as well as other
artists. Tim has also collaborated with Tony Rohr as the Afternoon Coffee
Boys, their debut release on Clink selling out in days and continuously
demanding repress. Upcoming releases from them include a full EP on Cocoon
due out in February.

As if Tim isn't busy enough, he is also the owner and chief mastering
engineer at Manmade Mastering in Brooklyn, NY, where he cuts dubplates and
masters. His precise ear, attention to detail and demand for perfection have
created a devoted following with his clients. Somehow between producing,
running his labels and cutting records, he still finds time play
international gigs, sharing his sought-after sound with fans and dancefloors
alike.

in 2001.  As a DJ, Philip holds a residence at Barcelona's Raum Club,
formerly held a monthly event in San Francisco called "Soda", and has
performed in New York, Austin, Portland, Seattle, and Montreal.

It was across from the 'ol Custer & Rankin spot, I believe. Doesn't help 
now since it's morning, sorry!

Didn't go cuz I was a pussy, but sounded like the crew had pretty genuine 
intentions. If they would throw a party that wasn't in the pouring rain 
I'd definitely check it out.

This party was incredible.  Big thanks to those who put it on.  How late did
the party end up going?  I left around 5:45 because my driver was exhausted,
would have loved to stay and listen to that dirty bass all night.  God I
love good house, nothing else quite like it.

It was a great night. Speedy J @ RML was an incredible experience (I
highly recommending finding an event at RML that suits your tastes
and then going--Naut, the owner, and the rest of the RML staff,
are very approachable and excited about their facility--as well
they should be).

The eleven p.m. show (and related chatting) finished in time to
get to Tonal shortly before QBAM took the decks (while Andrew
was still spinning) and the rest of the morning was hopping,
sweaty, greasy, underground fun.

The party was awesome.  Eric's set was funky and a good way to get us
started, and then Andrew & Origami kept it going with the yummy yummmy bass.
Big ups to Andrew for droppin' that Brand New Heavies track that I love so
much.

QBAM brought the shoulder shake as I knew he would and rocked the floor til
it was moist & wet. I haven't danced that much and gotten that sweaty in...
well let's just say it's been a long time. He finished with some of the
rock'n house that the hipsters love so much, and then it went deeeep and
sexy. I loved Leonard's set but was too tired to dance much longer so I left
around 5.

A few more fans would have helped the heat, but I'll admit to loving the
tropical atmosphere. humidity makes my hair curl ;) Thanks guys for a great
underground party. Huge props to all  involved!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: job opportunities

So my employment @ Cinder Block pretty much lasted only a day!  Yes.. a
day!  What happen was the office position i was like being transitioned to
like some kinda new like position/ title thing, so the person working the
old position i was suppose to start working was finishing out his/ her
days of employment w/ the company... so in order for me to start work for
the company, the HR person, Cheryl i think her name is who happ3ns to be
old skool Homies' w/ Chris Jackson btw, had me work in the ummmm... lol...
ummm.. hmmm.. the manual labor no no no wait.. the warehouse!

So yeah.. it was my job to fold like 80 shirts per minute & ummm... clip
100 shirts per minute w/ the store tags & with this label gun thingie...
but I was timed @ folding 30 shirts & tagging like 50 shirts w/ the gun &
the manager of that department like totally wanted me to improve by the
end of the day... I mean.. seriously.. it was my 1st day man... ya know???

So i started getting the hang of it & gradually sped up  w/ my folding &
gun tagging... then i was tagging these "Rock n Roll" shirts for HOT TOPIC
& somehow i poked my finger w/ the gun accidentally & started bleeding...
no big i thought.. i asked the manager for a band aid & he started
freaking out.. he rushed me to the bathroom & like it was like this 911
dealie the way he was acting... Seriously!  I mean.. i understand that
like i was working w/ clothes & getting blood on them is like so not what
the stores wanna see!  So yeah... like my poke got all like patched up &
the manager took me to the HR office to sign liability papers so i
wouldn't sue CinderBlock for getting a small cut on my finger.  LoL.. i
was like ummmm.. yeah.. ok... whatev!  BUt yeah... it was kinda freaky how
this guy was acting w/ urgency

Then 2 hours later while i was still working & thought i was doing a good
job, Hello 2Day, i got fired 'cause the manager dude didn't think i was a
good fit for his sweat shop basically!  Well.. like 3 months later, i
finally got my $80 for a days work.

The End

C'mon Oz, tell 'em about the other job you had for one day in Campbell w/ 
Matt Downer. Ended up with squatters in downtown San Jose? That's a much 
better story ;-)

I can't remember if I already posted this one.  Oh well.  You need to =20

home made pizza, and now I'm listening to an interview on Jeff Rense =20
and I think he's talking about those microwave guns the Air Force =20
commandant says we should test on American citizens before we use them =20
internationally.  What's more outrageous, sound cannons to subdue the =20

Good thing I moved away years ago, eh?  Truly the Twilight Zone =20
incarnate.

There's nothing wrong about talking about money.  For so many
generations, we've all been taught "don't talk about money.  Money is
a dirty topic.  Money is something that's secretive."  That is what
has gone wrong in all of our lives.  We don't talk about it.  You need
to talk about it.  It's a conversation we all need to have and it
should be a conversation you should want to have with everyone in your
life.

This is an article I found that had a very comprehensive rebuttal to DCA being a cure for cancer. It is way more in depth than my initial response but essentially says what I was trying to convey.

d in it as a system in which "The State not only is authority which governs=
 and molds individual wills with laws and values of spiritual life, but it =
is also power which makes its will prevail abroad... For the Fascist, every=
thing is within the State and... neither individuals nor groups are outside=
 the State... For Fascism, the State is an absolute, before which individua=
ls or groups are only relative... Liberalism denied the State in the name o=
f the individual; Fascism reasserts the rights of the State as expressing t=
he real essence of the individual."[1] The article discussed other politica=
l and social doctrines of the time by describing fascism as: "the resolute =
negation of the doctrine underlying so-called scientific and Marxian social=
ism... and as rejecting (in democracy) "the absurd conventional lie of poli=
tical equalitarianism, the habit of collective irresponsibility, the myth o=
f felicity and indefinite progress".[1]=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A"Fascism is definitel=
y and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism, both in the politi=
cal and economic sphere. ... The Fascist State lays claim to rule in the ec=

e length and breadth of the country by means of its corporate, social, and =
educational institutions, and all the political, economic, and spiritual fo=

rel, Charles Peguy, and Hubert Lagardelle are invoked as the sources of fas=
cism. Sorel's ideas concerning syndicalism and violence are much in evidenc=

ascist intuitions". Both Sorel and Peguy were influenced by the Frenchman H=
enri Bergson. Bergson rejected the scientism, mechanical evolution and mate=
rialism of Marxist ideology. Also, Bergson promoted =E9lan vital as an evol=
utionary process. Both of these elements of Bergson appear in fascism. Muss=
olini states that fascism negates the doctrine of Marxist socialism and its=
 doctrine of historical materialism. Hubert Lagardelle, an authoritative sy=
ndicalist writer, was influenced by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon who, in turn, in=

Subject: [sfraves] The 1 day job in Campbell Re: [sfraves] NRR: job opportunities

OK... so like the day after Chirstmas, I talk to Matt Downer on the
phone... he told me that he needed help like with his business yada yada
yada 'cause he "can't do eveything myself"... so I offered to work w/ him
& get his shit organized &  stuff 'cause at the time, we were reeaaly good
friends & stuff!  So we ended up talking that night for like 3 hours on
the phone, literally.  Then he told me all the things, all the benifits i
woiuld get by working with him & all this money i would make working for
him & yada yada la la la!  His promises even included him giving me my own
lap top & a condo for to stay at for free that he owned so i could finish
my Adult School Education & still work for him in SJ!  Dope!

So the next morning, he picks me up in Hercules & brings me all the way to
Campbell to his "office" which is basically his garage. He had me change
in grubby clothes to start work.  He told me to organize his garage while
he attended meetings all day.  OK.. now you gotta understand, by organize,
he meant file like 20 boxes of reciepts, documents, papers, jounral
thingies, accounting books, & mislleaneous papers... then there were
products he stocked from all the companies he owned that needed to be put
somewhere, this messy ass desk, a computer that needed t be put together,
phones answered, and general housekeeping (dust, wash, windex, vacum, etc)
that needed to be done!  So i slaved away that day and did what needed to
be done.  He came home like around 8PM & he was impressed with my work! 
We then spent the next 2 hours putting things in storage in the backyard!

Oh yeah.. it was my 1st night of well.. an online class that I was suppose
to like get online & do whatever, but I forgot my sylabus for the class @
home or something & didn't have the proper log in info i needed to do that
class thing online that night.

He dropped me off @ the Cal Train station by his house & well.. after 2
hours of waiting & seeing like 3 Cal Trains zoom by, i was stuck!  I
mean... it was still like holliday hours from xmas, & the trains stopped
running early.  I mean, i seriously thought he picked me up from Hercules
that morning & it was just curtious on his part to bring me home after i
was done working for the day, then I'd do the commute thing starting the
next day.  I mean... Matt didn't tell me he wasn't going to & it was
probably my bad just to assume.  BUt i dunno... I mean... we he got back
from his like 10 hour Meeting whatever & kept saying "I'm sooo tired", i
guess he was planning on it, but well... I wouldn't even ask a tired
person to do a 200 mile back & forth drive just to bring me home.  BUt
still.. ya know?

So funny enough, i didn't remember Matt's phone ### by heart & the paper i
had it written on was in Hercules & 411 didn't have it either!  I also
didn't know anyone elses phone ### i could call in the South Bay cause
well... i just didn't have my list with me.  So after a long while, i went
across the street to the Safeway Plaza & i dunno... i just figured it it
was more well lighted than the Cal Train Station & i could figure out what
i needed to do to be safe if i was gonna spend the next many hours by
myself.

So as soon as i got to Safeway, i just like stood there by the phone booth
& man, i was like heeeeeeella confuzed 'cause I was in this mondo pickle. 
But atleast I felt kinda safe.  Then this dude like came up to me and like
asked me for change to make a phone call & I lied & said i only had enough
money for me to take the train in the morning when Cal Train opened up & i
was pretty stuck.  Then he gave me this whole sob story about going to his
Sister's house in Redingin the morning, his Mom is the Hospital, his
grandmother, & calling his ex girlfriend's cousin who lived around the
corner.  So after he was done venting, then i vented to him about my whole
day & how I was stuck & why i was where i was @ the moment.  We kinda
talked for a while longer before he said that he'd like help me out & just
stay with me 'til Cal Train opened up since he was in the same predicament
as well!

Oh yeah.. this guy's name was Jack.  I actaully called him Crack Head Jack
'cause well.. he told me how he was spun for 3 days & he was like coming
down hard which is why he was soooooo emotional.  I mean.. i have a thing
about trusting strangers way to quick, but I dunno.. something about Jack
was sincere.  So i ended up giving him money to make that call & actually
a few minutes later, we were hangin' out at his ex girlfirends's cousin's
pad.  We were probably there for like an hour & 1/2 'til her parents got
home & we left!

While we were walking back to Safeway, he told me that it would probably
be better if we head downtown & kick it at some of the empty houses over
there.  Well... it was his hood, so i figured he knew what he was talking
about!  Anywaze, the next few hours we spent in downtown like going to
tacobell, walkin' around campus, & we actually hung out & slepton this
porch of this 1 abandoned house.

When daylight hit, we went to a donut shop & had coffee & donuts & had
like this loooooong ass goodbye.. I mean... we were reeeeeally close by
that point & practically knew almost everything about each other from
talkin' the whole night.  It was Awesome, sad, but hella touching!  He
told me that as soon he made it up to Redding, he was gonna call me!  We
even planned on hangin' out again, i'd like do a day trip up to Redding &
stuff.  But yeah, it took 3 hours, but i finally made it home.. Needless
to say, I didn't bother going back to work for Matt Downer, CEO again!  Oh
yeah.. he called me that night & we kinda had a mondo bitch session at
each other.. lol.. Hello 2day.. we ain't spoken since then :)  Hello 2day

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper into
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that
make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking trainspotters lose their
shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. He
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  With
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during that
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to head
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb
monthly parties. Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

TIM XAVIER

Tim Xavier made himself a household name for techno fans in the late 90s
with his innovative releases on Blueline, and since he has continued to push
the envelope with new sounds and ideas. His techno releases have been
consistent and solid, having signed work to major labels such as Default,
Advanced and PV. He has been featured on CD compilations by well known
techno artists such as Chris Liebing and Christian Wunsch, and his tracks
get repeated play by top names such as Luciano, Pan-Pot, Richie Hawtin,
Magda, Marco Carola, Troy Pierce and Adam Beyer.

More recently, he has expanded his talents and broadened his production
spectrum into the minimal genre, starting two new labels in 2005: LTD400 and
Klickhaus. LTD400 is his solo label featuring his own work, and the releases
have been featured on mix compilations by Ricardo Villalobos and Steve Bug.
His new project, Klickhaus, will feature his own production as well as other
artists. Tim has also collaborated with Tony Rohr as the Afternoon Coffee
Boys, their debut release on Clink selling out in days and continuously
demanding repress. Upcoming releases from them include a full EP on Cocoon
due out in February.

As if Tim isn't busy enough, he is also the owner and chief mastering
engineer at Manmade Mastering in Brooklyn, NY, where he cuts dubplates and
masters. His precise ear, attention to detail and demand for perfection have
created a devoted following with his clients. Somehow between producing,
running his labels and cutting records, he still finds time play
international gigs, sharing his sought-after sound with fans and dancefloors
alike.

With these:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanderlin/358742603/

Ten other cities had these 'light-bright' promotions but only Boston reacted
to them. I have been reading this all afternoon and I can't stop laughing!
The mayor in Boston didnt think it was funny but I sure did!

Anyone in SF find some mooninites?

"...nerds get their pants pulled down and they are spanked with moon rocks!"
