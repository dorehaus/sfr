That's one thing that really sucks about renegades... Especially ones
where you have to walk out of sight of the parking area to get to the
party.  At least at most paid events they have some type of security
'd00dz' watching the parking.

One might think of it as music. One wouldn't want to hear the same

	The probable cause, as I'm sure you well know, of the effect you
describe is the fact that marijuana largely uses serotonin to achieve its
effects.  Serotonin is also what is believed to be responsible for REM
sleep and dreams.  Hence, your serotonin levels fucked up = your REM sleep
fucked up.  But I'm sure it's something that could easily rectify itself
if you went off THE herb for periods at a time...

Marijuana has absolutely no effect,as far as I know on serotonin (5HT) receptors..

thanks for the info.  there are two things i feel need to be said from

compilation mixed by a DJ is a new viable music piece.

two other comments: of course, it doesn't matter if you are right if
the other side has all the lawyers.  it sort of sucks, and it's
definitely in the spirit of the movement, that the music of our scene
can only be shared if people are willing to decide that it's important
enough to risk potential legal problems.

I don't know about any link between mj and serotonin.  I do know that I
used to use L-Tryptophan (when it was still available) as a sleep-promoting
agent.  L-Tryptophan is well known to be a serotonin precursor, and while
I was taking it, I would have the most intense and memorable dreams.  So
I am convinced about the association between serotonin and dreaming.

on page 69, from the Psychedelic Encyclopedia:

    "MDMA does, however, exhibit an unusually high ration between the
amount needed to get minimum effects and that which may be dangerous due
to temporary rise in blood pressure.  For most users, 50-75 mg is required
to be effectively perceived, while 200-250 mg (a fifth to a quater of a
gram) is an amount verging on overdosage.  Such a narrow window for the
proper dosage range is incomon with psychedelics in general, but is an
important consideration in regard to the MDA family.  People suffering
from hypertension or heart problems, who are using MAO inhibitors, or are
epileptic or pregnant, are not considered to be good candidates for
experimentation with MDMA or MDA, and most informed sources caution that
no more than a quarter of a gram of either substance be taken over a short
space of time.  Carelessness and human nature being what they are, on
occasion some individuals have ingested larger amounts and survived.  In
his appendix to Ecstasy: The MDMA story, Alexander Shulgin cites several
papers about such incidences for the reader who is curious."

but this is the informatin i was going on....

You know, I wish them luck in trying to find out WHO actually made the
disks.  The most they would be able to find out is the manufacturer (the
people who pressed them), and I doubt that they could be held liable for
anything.

Next, WHO is Spun and what is Garth.  Are they entities or artists, or a
group? I wanna know...

Large corporate record companies really suck!!! These bastards retard
technological progress constantly by yelling piracy (remember the DAT
debacle), and the lap dogs of the House and Senate (not to mention the
White House) are more than ready to compromise certain rights of
individuals, for that almighty entertainment buck.

I hope people keep putting out compilation CD's, and I hope that you and
others keep selling them.

And I hope the large corporate record companies, responsible for most of
the inane categorized rubbish, rot in the eternal pit of vinyl from which
they srung.

Keep it alive, and keep it rengade!

	Oops!  It was LSD that has the link to serotonin, my mistake.  But
it's quite likely that marijuana has an effect, also, especially if
serotonin-inducing drugs block memory loss or whatever...I did learn in my
physiological psychology class (I work in a physiological psych lab) that
serotonin does produce REM sleep and dreams, and yes, L-Tryptophan is one
of the Best sleep aids, because what your body really needs is REM sleep,
not just sleep.  That's why if you take sleeping pills, you won't
necessarily wake up refreshed, because they'll just put you into deep
sleep, not REM sleep.

Subject: Re: Screw the record companies....

.... but save the indies and most of all, save the real artists.

one of the issues has to do with getting paid for your work.  as a software
type, i get peeved when i see my software in someone's hands that they have
pirated.  it's a matter of making a living, you see. writing software is
the art/skill that i have, and if people pay me for my work, i can write
more and better.  if they don't pay me for my work, i go do something
else.  simple as that.

similar situation in the indie recording field.  if a pressing is 500 or 
1000 records, total, the artist may get to make another recording.  if
5000 tapes or CDs use that recording without royalties, "flooding" the
market, and not even giving credits, the artist's market has been
swamped with pirated copies.  whereas, if all those folks had actually
gone out and bought the original recording, the artist would be a
number one top seller.

one problem, of course, is that the distribution network for bootlegs is
much better and more effective than for original recordings.  too, 
original recordings are way more expensive than bootlegs.  when you consider
that an original recording may cost $10, and a compilation of 50 such
recordings costs $15, people's choices of where to spend their money 
become a clear matter of economics.

there is a similar situation in the software industry.  it used to be that
a word processor or spread sheet cost $495 to own.  now, the cost of such
packages is essentially their media costs.  for recording artists, we know
roughly what their media costs are: the cost of a CD or piece of vinyl. i
know the media cost of a 90 minute tape (in qty 100: $1.25 or less).  if
the media cost of a high quality recording of 90 minutes is $1.25 or less,
why is the retail cost $4.99 or even $9.99 or even higher?

if the indie recording industry wants its proper reward, perhaps it should
recosider its pricing strategies.

The probable cause, as I'm sure you well know, of the effect you
describe is the fact that marijuana largely uses serotonin to achieve its
effects.  Serotonin is also what is believed to be responsible for REM
sleep and dreams.  Hence, your serotonin levels fucked up = your REM sleep
fucked up.  But I'm sure it's something that could easily rectify itself
if you went off THE herb for periods at a time...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ya, but maybe you didn't understand me.  I don't WANT it to rectify itself
because I don't feel rested when have I have heavy intense dreams all night.
Besides, like someone pointed out, there is a pretty wide range of serotonin
levels between person to person so that my (possibly) reduced levels may 
still be higher than someone elses normal levels.  Although, I could be one
with lower levels in the first place and than I could be lowering it even 
more but who cares?  I'm not complaining.

Well, the only thing i can add against your argument about flooding the
market with bootleg copies of records via the mixed tapes is that you are
comparing apples and oranges in my humble opinion.
I think,(course i could be way wrong) that most people buy mixed tapes/cd's
for the reason that they are mixed, and not for a certain song. I know
that I do. If I like a certain song, then i will buy the record for that 
song, and not try to find a mixed thing with it on it. 
Also, you need to think about who most of the indie records in question 
are targted for: dj's. most of this music is "dance" music, and who is 
the largest purchaser of said music but dj's. Now the dj's i know 
wouldn't be buying a mixed thing to get a song, they have this thing 
about doing their own mixes :)

"How can you be in two places at once when you're not anywhere at all?"
This question, coined by a group of philosophers 2 decades ago will be 
answered this Saturday with the simultaneous occurrence of Wicked and The 
Gathering.  Either party should deliver musically, though The Gathering's
line up consists of DJs that don't get quite as much exposure as the
Wicked posse, and so might deliver sets that will sound a little fresher.
The important thing to realize is that rhythm is universal and exists
within all aspects of nature.  When you become one with the beat, you will
in essence, be *everywhere* at once.  So whichever party you choose, soar
with the music, transcend space & time, and you won't miss a thing.

On Friday, we'll have a chance to show our appreciation for the talent and 
generosity Dubtribe has brought to our scene.  It's their birthday party and
it's free.  Dubtribe is the embodiment of what live techno should be about 
and we're very lucky to have them here.  

To all the reality surfers who will be riding the sound waves this weekend:
Let's remember to look out & care for each other when we're far from shore.

I'd go a step further -- the appearance of an especially hot but previously 
unknown track on someone's mix tape or CD will cause other DJ's to seek the
track out, increasing the demand for that piece of vinyl.  When all's said
and done, these "bootlegs" often function as free promotion for little known
artists.

That having been said, BMI and ASCAP has threatened to (and I think in
NYC they've done this once or twice) go after retailers of "contraband"
material.  After all, it's just as illegal to profit from the retail of
a verboten product as it is to produce it.  And technically, the pressing
plants are liable as well -- oh well, such is life in a country that,
to paraphrase Hakim Bey, has such a huge and arcane body of laws that
every man, woman and child is, wittingly or otherwise, an outlaw at some
level.

Subject: Mix tapes/CDs, pricing, and royalties
Status: 


There is no excuse for charging $20 for a CD and not paying
royalties to any of the songs on it.  The DJ is basically selecting tunes
and doing the mechanical work of fading between them -- the majority of
the effort has still been made by the people who made the music, most of
who would be glad to get greater exposure and even a small slice of
royalties for their work.

As a person who makes music, I know I would be incredibly pissed off
if someone packaged it and resold it for big bucks without my consent
and without paying me royalties.  Furthermore, I would be legally
justified in taking action.

I can deal with cheap mix tapes since they are not master-quality and
generally aren't filling anyone's bank.  I could legally contest these
too, but I wouldn't, since anyone who really likes my hypothetical tune
is likely to go find it and buy it as the tape wears out.  I would be
much happier, though, and even support their distribution, if artist
information (contacts, etc.) were included.  Cheap mix tapes are much
like shareware -- you like it, you go buy it.

Distribution and sales each take their several-dollar cut.  If you want
your CD in Tower you've got to pay their pound of flesh.  This is why
punk labels like Dischord sell CDs postpaid for $8 and albums for $6 --
they're making at least as much profit off direct sales and don't have
to pay suckfish to do marketing they don't want.

I'll say it again:  there is NO excuse for charging $20 for a CD and 
not paying royalties to the people who made the music.

Subject: mixing for profit...
Status: 

My last post regarding the selling of CD's for profit and those who wish to
punish them was aimed *mainly* at large conglomerate record companies.

The artists represented by BMI and ASCAP generally do not make much dance
(read house/trance) music.  Most house/trance whatever (I will call it
house) is done by independent labels like my own.  The only time I would
really consider pressing charges or trying to obtain some jack is if the
person really hit it big and was making bank from my music.  Otherwise, for
the effort it takes to track down somebody selling booties or copies, and
the cost of litigation, I would just as well ignore it or write a letter
issuing a warning *if* word got back to me that it was occuring.  It really
all depends on how prevalent the use of a particular track is, and how much
money the supposed pirate is making.

But this whole thing about somebody should give over jack for usage of a
track is a mixed bag with me.  On one hand, I think it is obscene to charge
that much for pre-recorded material, on the other hand the production costs
of putting out a cd such as spun and in the runs that it was in justifies
the price (I guess as long as no obscene profit is being made, but now
we're really getting into relativistics [sic] here).  Another point is that
a track taken from my record has been and issued en-masse it's great advert
for my product, on the other hand if they do not mention it at all what
hope do I have of selling my material.  So the real answer here is equity.
Thus my policy: Sell alot?  Pay me *AND* don't forget to mention in the
liner notes who made what.  Sell a little to none?  Forget the jack *AND*
don't forget to mention in the liner notes who made what.  Sell none?  Not
my problem *BUT* don't forget to mention in the liner notes who made what.

So under all conditions I get props for what was made by my company and the
artist is represented, even under the worst conditions.  Under the best
conditions everyone benefits.  This is fair and equitable, and emphasizes
sharing over greed.  But if a mutha****er *fails* to give props, I'll be on
'em  like white on rice, epsecially since it's so little to ask.  And in
this place (SF bay area) it's easy to find 'em & fine 'em.  If folks would
just be decent about what they do then all would be well.  The problem with
doing that with the CD's that have been released is that most companies,
even the small ones, want everything no matter what.  I'll take a little
now, for alot later.


Sampling:
I feel the same about sampling except...if you sample a small portion of a
track, like a beat, or a .5-1sec. sample.  You can have it.  If it's any
more than that, ante up!  For the smaller samples, no props, no jack.
Anything else, the company gets both props & jack.

20Hz is all about that,
John

As someone who buys the stuff, I like the idea of giving credit to the
artists who produced the material.  If the people putting out the mix tape give
credit for each track, and perhaps also indicate where one might send away
to get the disk it came from, I would find that very helpful, because so often
I hear a track I really like, and would like to get more like it,
if only I could figure out who the artist was and where to find the music.

	This will never happen because the DJs that release mix CDs and
widely distributed mix tapes would never openly publish the names of
their songs, much less tell you where to buy them.  This would let
every other DJ in the world buy all the same music that Garth plays. 
Sure, you can usually find out what the tracks are called, but
big-name DJs don't want you to find out that easily, because if you
could find all the same music that they have, who's to say that you
couldn't mix it better than they could?  I guess it's just their way
of keeping a competitive edge...

Subject: my trip back part 1/3


Hello sfravers,

Fancy here back from New York City's East 
Village.  Here's my follow-up on my travels across this land.  I lived in 
New York for about 5 months and went camping twice: to a rainbow gathering in
Vermont and then New Hampshire and to a rainbow gathering in Kentuky.  New York
was a trip.  There were lots of funky looking people living in the East Village
kinda like Haight St but with a New York flava.  There is the continuous sound
of emergency vehicles going on in the background.  When I was living/partying/
staying there, I met 4 people who eventually moved to sf.

Partying in New York was fun.  I went to about 10 raves and a bunch of 
weeklies, underground parties, and after-parties.  I even went to some great
raves in Rhode Island.  But all in all, I'm back in sf because I like the 
parties here even better.

Living in NYC was fun but it also had its down side.  In my opinion, NYC is one
of the places where you are as far from nature as you can get.  Concrete 
buildings line both sides of almost every street.  Soil is something that is 
not often seen.  There are a few empty lots in East Village but they are 
enclosed by fences.  When I stepped out the door, I would see asphalt roads,
concrete buildings, tons of people, tons of vehicles.  The sound of emergency
vehicles seemed to always be in the background.  The up side is that there are
tons of restaurants serving food from every corner of the globe.  And 
food in the East Village costs less than comparable food in SF.  I survived on
$1.50 fallafels for a month and a half until I got tired of em.  In fact,
almost everything in NYC costs less than in SF except for the rent.  Taxi 
rates, non-Korean corner store groceries, bottled water, herbs all had lower
prices in the East Village and Lower East Side than in SF.  For some reason,

without exception I found that all the Korean corner stores had higher prices
than neighboring corner stores & I was wondering how they stayed in business.
The answer is that in order to find what you want at another store at a cheaper
price one would have to walk a few blocks and many New Yorkers are willing to 
pay for convinience.  If you went to a 
corner store in the financial district or Upper West Side the prices of goods
would be more.  Gasoline and public transpo, and bridge and tunnel extortion 
fees costs more.  Public tranpo, and the bridge&tunnel crossing rates are 
controlled by a private firm called, "Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey" the same company that could put together the huge amount of capital to
build the World Trade Center which they rent out.

Upon finally leaving NYC I headed back down to Florida, the state that I said
I would never go back to ever again.  Well while I was in New York, I
corresponded by mail and telephone to my Public Pretender in Kew West who was
handling my court papers regarding that case of sleeping in my car.  Some of
you may recall that I ended up in jail for that.  I had no choice but to plead
guilty and after $45 and tons of long-d phone calls which my public pretender
almost never replied to, I was clear with respect to the law down there, except
that my finger-prints and mug-shot and personal info. file is on some database
in that god-forsaken-state, Florida.  AFter leaving NYC, I was drawn to Florida
like a fly to shit.  So there I was in Florida Keys again enjoying the 
beautiful view and but this time I really had to hide my car well when I chose
to sleep in it.  On the keys, this was very, very difficult because every place
is frequented by patrol cars (in the Keys, you see a cop car on the one and 
only highway about one every 3 minutes and once I counted 11 cop cars while 
driving about 3 miles) and all these officers have NOTHING TO DO.  Thus the 
smallest offenses are happily enforced.  

I considered living in Key West for a month or so but decided against it 
because Key Westers have such a small town mentality, and they seemed really
dumb compared to city folk.  I was amazed at reading the Key West newspaper
because it's got so many spelling mistakes and grammar worse than mine.
I decided to get out of Florida hell hole when my car decided it needed some
repairs.  That night I decided to stay at a motel and watch some TV and on the
local news, they talked about some child-molesting suspect and they showed a
sketch on TV of his face, AND it looked like my face!!!!  It never gave me any
trouble though.  About 3 miles away from the Alabama border, I decided to visit
a beach and say goodbye to Florida by getting stoned.  I parked at a local
volunteer firehouse parking lot (they gave me permission) and walked to the
beach and saw half a baby shark that was cut in half by some bigger shark.  I
got my bong out and began to take in the beauty of the sea.
  In either 
direction as far as I could see I was the only human on the beach.  Then outa
nowhere a volunteer firestation pickup truck approaches me and I quickly put my

bong back in my napsack.  Out of it stepped a cop and he asked me for my ID.
I aksed him if I was doing anything wrong and he said no.  Then he stared at
me for about a min. and then says I smell like pot and asked me if he could 
search my bag.  Florida has a pot-paraphanalia law that could get you jailed 
for some time totally depending on the judge.  I said, "yes/no".  And then he
asked me if the reason he couldn't search my bag was because I had something
to hide.  I told him, "I could either let you search my bag or I can not let 
you search my bag and I decided to not let you search it."  He then asked me if
I was arrested before and I told him "no".  Then he stared at me for about 5
minutes and I stared back at him.  My heart was fucking pounding for each of

those seconds and I was hoping that he didn't see how fast my heart was beating
through the pulsating vein in my neck.  I didn't say anything and he didn't say
anything and then he just took off.  After 5 minutes of calming down I went
back toward my car and when I was within sight of my car, I noticed about 15
people including cops standing around my car looking intently through the 
windows.  There were now 3 cop cars parked next to mine.  Everybody - about 4
cops and all the volunteer firemen and women were peeking into my car!!  I gave
an expression of utter disgust on my face as I walked up to them and they all
quietly walked away.  I drove to the Alabama border and got rid of my bong and
pot pronto.  That was my brush with the law and again it was in Florida hell
hole.

On to Alabama.  On my way from SF to New York about half a year before, I 
stopped at a deserted beach and became friends with a skinny dog that followed
me down the beach and we basically hung out with eachother.  This is one of the
beaches that I described seeing all those huge dead fish lying on the beach in
my post about half a year ago.  Anyway, I wanted to find this same beach and it
happened to be Halloween night and I stopped at a grocery store in the general
neighborhood of the beach to ask for directions.  There was a guy hanging
around in front of the store, and as I approached he asked me if I had a dead
body in my car (the back seat of my car was packed with half of my belongings).
It being Halloween, I said, "of course!".  I found the beach and was just 
about to get
stoned (using an aluminum can) with some pot that I had forgotten to throw away
when I saw cop lights behind me.  The friendly Alabama cop asked me for ID and
registration and when I asked him what I was doing wrong, he said that someone
had reported that I may have a dead body in my car.  So I let him search it.

I found the same dog that I had befriended a half year ago and we hung out for 
the next three days.  I slept in my car and the dog slept outside right next
to my car.  The dog was still at starvation-level skinnyness but it was happy
none-the-less.  Sometimes when we were walking down the beach, my friend the 
dog would run about and make these incredible leaps into the air seemingly out
of joy.  Often when it was rummaging about in the bushes  behind the beach, I 
would silently think, "where are you dog?", and it would come running towards 
me.  On my
last day at that beach I bought it a bag of dog food and opened it right before
leaving so it wouldn't run after my car like it did when I left it the first 
time.

I went through Louisiana, Texas and then up to Montana.  I drove along the 
bottom of a large canyon that looked about the same size, at one point, as the 
Grand Canyon except that I was driving along the bottom of it!  What a trip
that was.  I went to Yellowstone which was beautiful and it being November,
it was very cold BUT I saw almost all of the sights alone instead of being 
overrun by throngs of tourists if you go during summer/fall/mid-late winter.  
The park officially closes all its roads to cars in early Novermber but last 
Nov.  it was open longer since it hadn't snowed.  

>From Montana, I went towards Washington state, but 15 miles outta Butte my car
started to fishtail slightly.  Since this old car has a steering problem, I 
decided to wiggle my steering wheel to see if that is what was causing it.  I
was going 65 mph and the wiggling of the steering wheel did not seem to cause
the rear of the car to wiggle when suddenly my car veered into the fast lane
sideways and then slid across the 30ft. wide center divide and then onto the
oncoming lanes of the highway I90 and then onto the shoulder of the opposite
direction where it slammed into a barbed wire post.  As I was travelling across
the center divide all I could see was snow very close to the windshield but I
held the car in a forward direction so it wouldn't roll and just basically see
where it'd take me.  It turns out I had hit a
patch of highway ice.  I thought the car was dead, but it was still alive and
only dented in  right above a rear wheel so I couldn't drive it or open the 
trunk.  A kind tow-truck driver towed my car and bent the body of the car away
from the tire so it was drivable.  Everytime my car hit a bump the car 
scratched the tire but my car limped into Washington state where I 
found out in Spokane it is incrediblely inexpensive to get rough body-work. 
The tow truck driver estimated about $2500 to repair it, and I got a rough 
pull-out-the-largest-dent job done for around $65.

Subject: my trip back part 3/3



On my way towards Seattle, I drove along a beautiful river and there was a 
plaque there commemorating an Amer-indian tribe.  It said that during the 
settling of the wild west, the settlers came upon a tribe that "was very
religious" and "peaceful" and didn't want to fight.  So the tribe went extinct.

In Montana, Idaho, and Washington, I drove along lonely roads where sometimes
I had the feeling I was the only human being around within a 20 mile radius.
That's a great feeling.  I also saw so many hunters, hundreds of them.  They
drive around in their pickup trucks (so they can load a large dead animal on 
it) and usually have a gun rack with some hunting rifles showing in the back
windshield.  They usually drive alone or in pairs.  And they take hunting
seriously.  There must be an entire industry that exists on selling all 
different kinds of the latest hunting paraphanalia.  There's hunting shoes,
hunting ounfits,  hunting caps, hunting guns with all their attachments,
hunting knifes, hunting manuals, and all kinds of hunting equip.  Half the
pickup trucks I passed on the roads also were carrying a little 4-wheeler for
those hunters who are too lazy to walk through the mountains, and/or pull their
kill back to their pickup trucks.  And after staying in the mountains for a
few weeks (in my car) I can say that there's nothing fresher than being woken
up in the morning by the sound of single rifle shot echoing through the 
mountains :-(  All through the day in the mountains in Montana, Idaho, 
Washington, and Oregon I could here one hunter or another shooting his gun.
These guys drive for miles to get to their hunting grounds, wake up real early,
spend tons of time actually doing the hunting, and tons of money for all the 
hunting frills.  Like I said, many hunters take their recreation very, very
seriously.

In Washington state, south of Canada, I parked my car late one night at a 
beautiful beach.  In the morning another car came by and out stepped two
surfer girls.  Wow.  I have never seen two surfer girls by themselves even
when I lived in Hawaii.  Yay to women's lib in Washington.  Oh yeah, it was
in Washington state where I saw the largest percentage of road construction
workers who were female.

Now I must recount a story about my attempting to enter the Canadian border.  
When I was in New Hampshire, I decided to stop into Canada because I was so
close.  I must mention that I went up there with a friend who in my opinion
looks like a cross between a hippie and a punker.  Anyway, we entered Canada
and were told to stop and park at the Immigration/customs building.  We were
told to fill out a form and then asked if we had $400 cash on each of us.  When
we said no, they brought each of us to a little room separately, and 
interviewed us for about 15 min each.  They asked me questions like what bank
I had an account in, they asked me to show them my credit card and ATM card and
they asked me a bunch of personal history questions like where was I born,
where was I working, etc.  The irony of the whole matter is that they knew from
the beginning that they were going to deny us entry because we said we didn't
have $400 on each of us BEFORE they interviewed us.  Well they denied us entry
and then before they allowed us to leave, they searched the car thoroughly. 
They said they were looking for weapons but the way they were looking into my
clothes, toothpaste, bug-spray, car and everything I knew it wasn't that.
When we were finally told we could go, I told myself I will never go to Canada
again. 

Now back to my return trip....
I kept driving west until I hit the Pacific ocean.  In Washington, the signs of
logging hit me the hardest.  I saw evidence of clearcut, vast empty tracks of 
treeless land in Montana and Idaho but here in Washington, west of the Seatle
bay, there is an amount of logging going on that is embarrassing.  See, when
I first undertook this journey across the US, I had no idea what logging was.
Well I learned the first-hand way.  It turns out that the logging companies own
huge amounts of land privately, PLUS they also log on National parks, National
Forrests, State parks, and Indian reservations.  

And this is what they would do:  they clearcut vast tracks of land, often on
the side of a hill or mountain.  By clearcut, I mean they cut EVERYTHING down
in that tract of land whether the tree has a diameter of 15 ft. or 2 in.  The
sections of trees that are sellable then are towed along the ground to a 
transport truck.  When sections of trees are towed along the ground, it rips
up the ground like a huge plow.  There is a huge amount of waste and many
downed trees as well as root sections and other tree sections are left on the
field. Thus when a logging company is done covering
a track of land, there is not one plant left standing and it literally looks
like a hurricane came over and mixed up the soil with tree sections and just
tore up every square foot of a clear-cut field that doesn't have a stump.  
What also trips me out
is that the loggers who do the dirty work of actually sawing a tree down are
say, in my estimate, between the ages of 25 to 40 years old, and many of the
trees they are cutting down are between the ages of 200-2,500 years old.  And
they call forrests, a "renewable resource".  Basically, vast amounts of $$$ 
are being made here and that is what it's all about.

The saddest part about the logging is that if every citizen of this country
saw a freshly clear-cut tract of land with their own eyes, I don't think there
would be any logging going on in this country.  I've heard that the amount of
logging going on in the Pacific Northwest ranks up there in terms of areas on
this currently semi-organic, self-contained, large-scale spaceship where huge 
amounts of trees are being cut down.  

Next is this idea of what is termed a "National Forrest" by whoever.  In 
Montana, Idaho, but especially Washington, there are these signs along the
roadway that designates an area as a "National Forrest".   The funniest thing
about it is that sometimes there ARE NO TREES in some areas demarcated as a 
National Forrest, only decaying tree stumps.  I'm not kidding here.  They also
used the same trick that I've seen done in Florida which is to leave a 20ft
wide patch of trees standing next to a highway but clearcut everything behind
it.  If you don't look closely, you will get the impression you are driving
through a forrest.  But often, they don't even care enough to conceal it....
there's tons of blatantly clearcut forrestland right along the highway.  
By the way, not only are there huge patches of clearcut land in "National 
Forrests" but also in land clearly marked by large highway signs as 
National Parks, State Parks, and even many American Indian reservations.

Another funny thing that got my attention is all these "No overnight parking"
signs all the way along the pacific coast from the top of Washington state 
until LA (I didn't go further south).  But camping is allowed in State and
County Beach Parks for a fee of $7-$12 a vehicle depending on which 
county you're in.  $10 a day corresponds to $300/mo. rent which isn't bad 
considering the view if there is one, and the location but you gotta realize
there's no kitchen and no privacy and the park rangers come by checking on
everyone at night and in the morn to make sure you aren't a squatter in this
land owned by the people of the US.

I talked to a dude in his 40s who said that all these signs started
popping up along the beach parking lots about 7 to 8 years ago.  Now the 
county and state park service hold a monopoly on beach camping all the way down
the coast.  What ate me up was how so many travelling middle-aged tax-paying
American tourists don't say, "what the hell are we paying taxes for?" and 
instead crowd these authorized beach camping areas because it's the law.

All in all, I had a very exciting trip on my way back from New York.  I hope
you enjoyed vicariously living through a very small portion of my experience.

[re: the story just posted]

A pretty good rule of thumb is, if a cop doesn't need permission to
search your vehicle, he won't ask.

It's 100% okay to not consent to a search. If the cop asks why, a
perfectly legitimate reason is "I don't like people going through my
stuff." You don't *have* to have a reason, but that's a good one.
Cops can look in your windows all they want. Make sure nothing
remotely suspicious is visible.

If they can't search, they will try and trip you up with word games or
*anything* what might make you incriminate yourself.

Ever have a cop ask "Have you been drinking?" If you say yes, it's
over! Now wasn't that easy for the policeman?

The part of the story about him being pulled over is a good example of
what to do. (Good for him there were no K9 units nearby).

First off, does everyone really WANT Garth's tracks?  I'm a DJ and
I don't WANT to sound like anyone else, so I don't really care what
is in Spun's or Jeno's crates.  :-)

I would love to put track info on my mix tapes, but I'm afraid some
weenie lawyer (as opposed to a cool lawyer) will take the tape out
of context of the underground/dance scene and sue my butt all over
the place if I get too detailed as to what is what.  I don't even 
put my full  name or phone number or anything on my tapes, except on 
copies that I give to promoters as audition tapes.

The bit about keeping it secret for competitive edge has been
hotly debated here (not three months ago, in fact), so I won't
go into it now.  Suffice to say that enough peole came up with
enough counter-examples to show that "hiding" tracks is more the 
exception than the rule.

after a rash of breakins to Internet computers here and abroad.

     The federally finaced Computer emergency Response team issued the
advisory, saying thousands of passwords already may have been collected
illicitly by people using advanced surveilance software.  Anyone who
discovers another person's password can enter the system as that person,
gain access to his [sic] confidential files and destroy or alter them.
 
     CERT would not give details of the break-ins.  Eugene Spafford, a
computer security specailist at Purdue University, said he has heard of
dozens of intrusions in the past several months.
     
     CERT said it is sending out software to strengthen Internet computers
against intrusion.

I'm no lawyer, but here's something I've heard (this is a recurring
topic on rec.music.gdead):

If you are asked to get out of your car, lock the door behind you.
Apparantly in some jurisdictions leaving your car unlocked is
tantamount to giving permission to search. Also, you should keep
your glove compartment locked (especially if there's something
in it) and keep your registration, etc. somewhere else in the
vehicle. If your glove compartment is locked, it is a closed
container and a permit is needed to search it. If it's open,
it's simply part of the vehicle...

Once again, this is not official legal advice. But if you have
something incriminating in your locked glove compartment and they
go in there without a permit a good lawyer might be able to get
you off.

Of course, the real question is how cool do you stay under pressure.
Unfortunately cops make me real nervous even when I have absolutely
nothing to hide. I think if I had something incriminating I would
have a hard time cooly refusing to consent to a complete search.
Hopefully it won't come to that. One thing that I do know...  if you
have Schedule I drugs in your car, don't speed! If you don't give
them a reason to stop you, they won't even notice you!

Don't obsess on it, but never forget that there is stilla war
going on out there.

Ah yes, one more thing. One problem is that the only people who
refuse searches are those with something to hide. If EVERYONE
refuses to give consent for a search of their vehicle, even if
they're clean, then everyone would be much better off. Once again,
I don't know what my reaction would be. It takes balls to stand
up for your rights in the face of a cop who is doing everything
he can to get you to surrender them. Or maybe ovaries :-). But
there does seem to be almost a moral obligation for those of us
who get stopped when we happen to be clean to refuse just as
resolutely as those of us who get stopped with illicit substances
in the car. I wish that I could know that I would have enough
strength to do that, I doubt myself in this respect. But it's
something to think about.

Fortunately, this is irrelevant. Not consenting to a search is by no
means any admission of guilt. There are very strong precedents for
this.

One thing I need to make clear is that you should never try to
actually stop a cop from doing anything. Refusing to give consent to a
search means saying "no" if they ask, and saying "for the record, I do
not consent to this search" if they are searching you or your vehicle.
And the more witnesses hear you, the better.

If they perform an illegal search and find 1500 lbs of cocaine in your
trunk, as far as the court is concerned, that cocaine does not exist.
They won't give it back of course, and you'll be discreetly IRS
audited and they'll follow you for months, and so on, but cops ask for
permission for a reason. Because you will probably be afraid and say
yes, and then in the eyes of the court their evidence is good.

"The Internet" is a "black box" or "cloud" into which you throw
packets with a destination. They more or less magically emerge from
the cloud at the destination.

The cloud consists of networks, routers, gateways, high speed backbone
nets, and all kind of things you probably don't even want to be aware
of. As far as you and your software are concerned, the important thing
is that your packets get from A to B intact and in reasonable time.

Given that its often hard to tell what route a packet will take, it's
hard to try and monitor a specific connection from "the middle of the
cloud". It is not really that hard, however, to snag everything that
passes through certain parts of the cloud, and filter for stuff that
looks interesting.  What is probably happening is someone has been
packet grabbing and looking telnet or rlogin sessions and grabbing
passwords.

The bottom line is that Internet communications are very insecure. If
you have any sensitive traffic, it should be encrypted at the
endpoints of the connection.  PGP is good for email. I think
eventually public key protocols will help for encrypted rlogin
sessions and the like.

The issue jslee raises about due credit for use of tracks even if no

give credit to the musicians and producers on my promo stuff.  On the
other hand, it makes it trivial for any lawyers on the other end to
'check me out'.  

The Spun and Garth CDs are being distributed in such a way that they are
in the same grey zone that most mix tapes are in -- partly for fans, 
partly for promo directly to clubs and promoters.  Sometimes both.
But I think the industry types will take greater notice *because* these
are in a digital format.  It's perfectly easy to lift pristine samples
off of any digital source . . .

I think music belongs to musicians and audiences, and I'm hoping the
message from groundbreaking efforts like the Garth and Spun promo CDs 
is heard loud and clear by the industry: the new era has arrived, DEAL
with it.  Invent reasonable methods for compensation, handling of
tracks and samples, etc., suitable for the digital era and producing
a balance of interests between musicians and audiences (instead of the
inverted values of the last 100 years where the distribution system is
designed to soak both musicians and audiences for the benefit of paper
shufflers and deal makers) . . . or watch the world go by . . .

It has been my experience that the way you are dressed is enough probable
cause for a search.  Furthermore, driving in a certain part of town can
be probable cause for search.  The laws and courts are very lenient in 
favor of the police for vehicle searches.  They have "experience
and training" to recognize "suspicious circumstances" 

Consider yourself lucky if you are even asked about a search - then
you have one shot to remain calm and respond.  I would guess that they
ask in some cases to further substantiate their case for probable cause. 
They would be hoping for signs of anxiety.

I don't know if these are actual password lists. What's been going around 
recently is a large dictionary of common words used for passwords (*very* 
common so it seems from th' hubub). With it someone can set up a program 
to run through the list on any particular account. Eventually, they'll 
hit a match. Best defense is to pick a *good* password. Use numbers and 
letters or any special characters your system lets you use. And 
definitely stay away from short words or names. That's like locking up 
your car with scotch tape. Don't have anything to protect, you think? 
Doesn't matter. A hacker doesn't want what's on *your* account. A hacker 
wants access. And don't you think your very name and reputation is worth 
protecting? Look at your password now. If you can find it in the 
dictionary or any baby names book, change it. JMAR.

I can understand both sides of this argument. I don't make music, but I 
do a lot of graphic design and some of it gets 'lifted' here and there. 
There's really nothing I can do to stop it. As an artist, the only thing 
I can do is keep moving and producing. By the time something of mine is 
copied, I've generally made my money on the job and moved on to something 
else. Watchdogging my work takes away from valuable time I need to 
create. And really, we all have our own tack on things. Nobody can really 
do your thing better than you, regardless of how they try. If only the 
buying public understood this bit a little better.

I have disagree with your comparison between software and music Bryce. 
Software generally falls under the 'tool' category. Something to make 
something else. Music is more of an end-product. Software comes before 
music onthe protection scale in my book, but I think we're going to have 
to re-think intellectual copyrights across the board very soon.

And don't forget that the direct buyers of most of the stuff on these cds 
are djs. No respectable dj I know of would buy someone else's mix to use 
it. Mix-tapes and cds are generally aimed at folks like me. People 
without the money or time to pursue the record-shopping required. Yeah, I 
could go out and buy the actual legal version of a track I liked, but I 
challenge any non-dj to *identify* much less find some of these. Chances 
are it's already out of print and was rare when it *was* in print. If I 
can find the real version of it, I'll get it, but usually it's hopeless. 
If I can identify a track, but not find it, chances are I'll keep my eyes 
open when the artist releases something else. 

Artists should take this current fiasco as a swift kick in the butt to 
keep working and evolving. Noone can be a one-hit wonder anymore. Take 
Richard James. You copy his stuff onto a mix-cd. He may get pissed, but 
in all reality, so what? He's got 1500 other tracks, a hundred of which 
he'll probably release tomorrow, all completely different from the track 
you lifted. By the time you get it mastered and on the cd, he'll be gone 
and on to something else. You may get a 'classic' track, but it'll still 
be old. An extreme example of course, but it should get the point across. 
The 'artist-of-liesure' banking for the future on works of the past is 
dying. Art is becoming hard work again. Will it be good in the long run? 
I don't know. I hope it all turns out for the better, because it isn't 
going to go away. JMAR. snip!

like CERT, I won't go into any details, but from what i've seen, both you
and CERT are right.  what is probably circulating are lists of cracked as
well as captured passwords.

though you cannot protect yourself too much against network sniffers,
that's up to your sysadmin, you can use a good password.  the easiest thing
you can do to thwart a dictionary-type crack is to capitalize one or more
letters in your password, any will do *except* the first or last since
that's always checked for.  throwing a special character in the middle of
even a common word will also make things harder for a cracker.

following is the announcement part of the CERT advisory for those of you

CA-94:01                         CERT Advisory
                               February 3, 1994
                      Ongoing Network Monitoring Attacks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   
In the past week, CERT has observed a dramatic increase in reports of
intruders monitoring network traffic.  Systems of some service
providers have been compromised, and all systems that offer remote
access through rlogin, telnet, and FTP are at risk.  Intruders have
already captured access information for tens of thousands of systems
across the Internet.

The current attacks involve a network monitoring tool that uses the
promiscuous mode of a specific network interface, /dev/nit, to capture
host and user authentication information on all newly opened FTP,
telnet, and rlogin sessions.

In the short-term, CERT recommends that all users on sites that offer
remote access change passwords on any network-accessed account. In
addition, all sites having systems that support the /dev/nit interface
should disable this feature if it is not used and attempt to prevent
unauthorized access if the feature is necessary. A procedure for
accomplishing this is described in Section III.B.2 below.  Systems
known to support the interface are SunOS 4.x (Sun3 and Sun4
architectures) and Solbourne systems; there may be others. Sun Solaris
systems do not support the /dev/nit interface. If you have a system
other than Sun or Solbourne, contact your vendor to find if this
interface is supported.

While the current attack is specific to /dev/nit, the short-term
workaround does not constitute a solution.  The best long-term
solution currently available for this attack is to reduce or eliminate
the transmission of reusable passwords in clear-text over the network.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     Root-compromised systems that support a promiscuous network
     interface are being used by intruders to collect host and user
     authentication information visible on the network.

     The intruders first penetrate a system and gain root access
     through an unpatched vulnerability (solutions and workarounds for
     these vulnerabilities have been described in previous CERT
     advisories, which are available anonymous FTP from
     info.cert.org).  

     The intruders then run a network monitoring tool that captures up
     to the first 128 keystrokes of all newly opened FTP, telnet, and
     rlogin sessions visible within the compromised system's domain.
     These keystrokes usually contain host, account, and password
     information for user accounts on other systems; the intruders log
     these for later retrieval.  The intruders typically install
     Trojan horse programs to support subsequent access to the
     compromised system and to hide their network monitoring process.

II.  Impact

     All connected network sites that use the network to access remote
     systems are at risk from this attack.
     
     All user account and password information derived from FTP,
     telnet, and rlogin sessions and passing through the same network
     as the compromised host could be disclosed.


III. Approach

     There are three steps in CERT's recommended approach to the
     problem:

     - Detect if the network monitoring tool is running on any of your
       hosts that support a promiscuous network interface.

     - Protect against this attack either by disabling the network
       interface for those systems that do not use this feature or by
       attempting to prevent unauthorized use of the feature on systems
       where this interface is necessary.

     - Scope the extent of the attack and recover in the event that
       the network monitoring tool is discovered.


     A.  Detection

         The network monitoring tool can be run under a variety of
         process names and log to a variety of filenames.  Thus, the
         best method for detecting the tool is to look for 1) Trojan
         horse programs commonly used in conjunction with this attack,
         2) any suspect processes running on the system, and 3) the
         unauthorized use of /dev/nit.

         1) Trojan horse programs: 

         The intruders have been found to replace one or more of the
         following programs with a Trojan horse version in conjunction
         with this attack:

           /usr/etc/in.telnetd 
           and /bin/login -  Used to provide back-door access for the
                             intruders to retrieve information
           /bin/ps  - Used to disguise the network monitoring process
           
         Because the intruders install Trojan horse variations of
         standard UNIX commands, CERT recommends not using other
         commands such as the standard UNIX sum(1) or cmp(1) commands
         to locate the Trojan horse programs on the system until these
         programs can be restored from distribution media, run from
         read-only media (such as a mounted CD-ROM), or verified using
         cryptographic checksum information.
         
         In addition to the possibility of having the checksum
         programs replaced by the intruders, the Trojan horse programs
         mentioned above may have been engineered to produce the same
         standard checksum and timestamp as the legitimate version.
         Because of this, the standard UNIX sum(1) command and the
         timestamps associated with the programs are not sufficient to
         determine whether the programs have been replaced.

         CERT recommends that you use both the /usr/5bin/sum and
         /bin/sum commands to compare against the distribution media
         and assure that the programs have not been replaced.  The use
         of cmp(1), MD5, Tripwire (only if the baseline checksums were
         created on a distribution system), and other cryptographic
         checksum tools are also sufficient to detect these Trojan
         horse programs, provided these programs were not available
         for modification by the intruder.  If the distribution is
         available on CD-ROM or other read-only device, it may be
         possible to compare against these volumes or run programs off
         these media.

         2) Suspect processes: 

         Although the name of the network monitoring tool can vary
         from attack to attack, it is possible to detect a suspect
         process running as root using ps(1) or other process-listing
         commands.  Until the ps(1) command has been verified against
         distribution media, it should not be relied upon--a Trojan
         horse version is being used by the intruders to hide the
         monitoring process.  Some process names that have been
         observed are sendmail, es, and in.netd.  The arguments to the
         process also provide an indication of where the log file is
         located.  If the "-F" flag is set on the process, the
         filename following indicates the location of the log file
         used for the collection of authentication information for
         later retrieval by the intruders.

         3) Unauthorized use of /dev/nit:

         If the network monitoring tool is currently running on your
         system, it is possible to detect this by checking for
         unauthorized use of the /dev/nit interface.  CERT has created
         a minimal tool for this purpose.  The source code for this
         tool is available via anonymous FTP on info.cert.org in the
         /pub/tools/cpm directory or on ftp.uu.net in the 
         /pub/security/cpm directory as cpm.1.0.tar.Z.  The checksum
         information is:

         Filename                Standard UNIX Sum         System V Sum
        --------------           -----------------         ------------
         cpm.1.0.tar.Z:               11097 6                 24453 12 

         MD5 Checksum
         MD5 (cpm.1.0.tar.Z) = e29d43f3a86e647f7ff2aa453329a155

         This archive contains a readme file, also included as
         Appendix C of this advisory, containing instructions on
         installing and using this detection tool.

     B.  Prevention

         There are two actions that are effective in preventing this
         attack.  A long-term solution requires eliminating
         transmission of clear-text passwords on the network.  For
         this specific attack, however, a short-term workaround
         exists.  Both of these are described below.

         1) Long-term prevention:

         CERT recognizes that the only effective long-term solution to
         prevent these attacks is by not transmitting reusable
         clear-text passwords on the network.  CERT has collected some
         information on relevant technologies.  This information is
         included as Appendix B in this advisory.  Note: These
         solutions will not protect against transient or remote access
         transmission of clear-text passwords through the network.

         Until everyone connected to your network is using the above
         technologies, your policy should allow only authorized users
         and programs access to promiscuous network interfaces.  The
         tool described in Section III.A.3 above may be helpful in
         verifying this restricted access.

         2) Short-term workaround:

         Regardless of whether the network monitoring software is
         detected on your system, CERT recommends that ALL SITES take
         action to prevent unauthorized network monitoring on their
         systems. You can do this either by removing the interface, if
         it is not used on the system or by attempting to prevent the
         misuse of this interface.

         For systems other than Sun and Solbourne, contact your vendor
         to find out if promiscuous mode network access is supported
         and, if so, what is the recommended method to disable or
         monitor this feature.

         For SunOS 4.x and Solbourne systems, the promiscuous
         interface to the network can be eliminated by removing the
         /dev/nit capability from the kernel.  The procedure for doing
         so is outlined below (see your system manuals for more
         details).  Once the procedure is complete, you may remove the
         device file /dev/nit since it is no longer functional.

         Procedure for removing /dev/nit from the kernel:

         1. Become root on the system. 

         2. Apply "method 1" as outlined in the System and Network
         Administration manual, in the section, "Sun System
         Administration Procedures," Chapter 9, "Reconfiguring the
         System Kernel."  Excerpts from the method are reproduced
         below:

         # cd /usr/kvm/sys/sun[3,3x,4,4c]/conf
         # cp CONFIG_FILE SYS_NAME  

         [Note that at this step, you should replace the CONFIG_FILE
         with your system specific configuration file if one exists.]

         # chmod +w SYS_NAME
         # vi SYS_NAME

            #
            # The following are for streams NIT support.  NIT is used by
            # etherfind, traffic, rarpd, and ndbootd.  As a rule of thumb,
            # NIT is almost always needed on a server and almost never
            # needed on a diskless client.
            #
            pseudo-device   snit            # streams NIT
            pseudo-device   pf              # packet filter
            pseudo-device   nbuf            # NIT buffering module
         
         [Comment out the preceding three lines; save and exit the
         editor before proceeding.]

         # config SYS_NAME
         # cd ../SYS_NAME
         # make

         # mv /vmunix /vmunix.old
         # cp vmunix /vmunix

         # /etc/halt
         > b

         [This step will reboot the system with the new kernel.]

         [NOTE that even after the new kernel is installed, you need
         to take care to ensure that the previous vmunix.old , or
         other kernel, is not used to reboot the system.]


     C.  Scope and recovery

         If you detect the network monitoring software at your site,
         CERT recommends following three steps to successfully
         determine the scope of the problem and to recover from this
         attack.

         1. Restore the system that was subjected to the network
         monitoring software.

         The systems on which the network monitoring and/or Trojan
         horse programs are found have been compromised at the root
         level; your system configuration may have been altered.  See
         Appendix A of this advisory for help with recovery.

         2. Consider changing router, server, and privileged account
         passwords due to the wide-spread nature of these attacks.
         
         Since this threat involves monitoring remote connections,
         take care to change these passwords using some mechanism
         other than remote telnet, rlogin, or FTP access.

         3. Urge users to change passwords on local and remote
         accounts.

         Users who access accounts using telnet, rlogin, or FTP either
         to or from systems within the compromised domain should
         change their passwords after the intruder's network monitor
         has been disabled.
         
         4. Notify remote sites connected from or through the local
         domain of the network compromise.

         Encourage the remote sites to check their systems for
         unauthorized activity.  Be aware that if your site routes
         network traffic between external domains, both of these
         domains may have been compromised by the network monitoring
         software.

This comment really honks me off.  "People keep stealing your stuff, so
you should get more of it so you'll always have some."  ???

Consumers should take this as a swift kick in the butt, to wit:  If you
buy this type of CD you are giving money to suckfish who repackage someone
else's work and sell it as their own, giving the original artists no
credit and no money.  The artists will not be able to live on money they're
not getting, and will stop making music.

Mix tapes are only cool if:
1) The artists are credited
2) They are a primarily promotional rather than a profit item
3) They are a profit item and the artists are paid

$20 for a mix CD that can't be used for live performance is a profit item.
If they don't make very much money, that's too bad, but the artists are
making ZERO, and artists have to pay rent just like you -- in addition 
to thousands of dollars of equipment for even the junkiest techno setup.

Bullshit.  Anyone making underground dance is not living a life of leisure.
Say you have a hot track and sell 2K 12" singles.  You're talking about maybe
$3 profit per unit (maybe jsl can help out with better numbers, I haven't
priced vinyl recently).  That's $6000, which will pay for your gear and
maybe three or four months of expenses if you're living real cheap.  How 
many people have a hit every three or four months?

I'll say it again:  if no one profits I don't mind.  If suckfish profit
I lose my temper.

First off, art in the historical sense of the word is about process *not* 
product. Nobody can steal your process, just the product. The process is 
what keeps the product coming. Any artist who sits on their ass nowadays 
worrying only about the product will be buried by these practices. And 
*no* I'm not condoning it, but it's there and it's only going to get 
worse. So what are you going to do? Complain or learn how to beat it? 
There's a shakedown going on now. Everyone and their dog bought a 
computer and calls themselves an artist (musician, designer, &c.) and 
started churning out tons of product. Some good, some bad, some very bad. 
Now people are realizing it wasn't the quick buck and fun they thought it 
would be. "hey this is *hard*". Damn right it is. And as people start to 
drop off, the ones who will be left are the ones who should have been 
making their art in the first place, the people whose art and process 
mean more than the product and the money. 

Second: I don't think anyone is really stupid enough to think that Garth 
is responsible for the music on that cd. Yeah, his name is on it. Doesn't 
mean he's taking credit for it. He just put it together. If this same 
logic was extended, it should mean that instead of having DJ Garth on 
that flyer, you should include his play-list. Correct me if I'm wrong, 
but it seems to me that a dj makes a lot more money from spinning than 
they do from mix-tapes. And why not go after the promoters who charge $20 
just for you to go in and listen to the dj who plays all these 
un-credited songs? Again I'm *not* condoning the cd, your logic just 
isn't holding up.

This is a double-edged sword. Yeah if I'm a musician, I'd like to see my 
name on something I've done, but what's to keep Joe Consumer who wants to 
buy track 'x' from buying the mix-tape on which it's listed with 20 other 
songs for $10 instead of the 12" for $15? Then it's called a compilation. 
You buy a mix tape for the mix not one particular song. List the tracks 
and people *will* start buying it for that one song you want to make 
money off of.

Again, sorry. Nobody said art was easy and cheap. And if they did, you 
can only blame yourself for being duped. Even though I'm not a musician, 
I *do* know this. Ask me about my computer/electric/phone/studentloan/ 
printing/film bills. I do know that there are only a handful of artists 
that history respects in each century that have made money from their 
art. That's the way it is. In any form of art, the money is made by the 
distributors, presenters and sellers, not the artists. That's the way it 
is. If this is not to someone's liking, they should think about another 
career. I didn't make it this way and wish it could be different, but 
that's the way it *is*. Money or no, I keep designing because it's 
important to me and I have no choice but to do it (with a stubby pencil 
if I have to). I know others who feel likewise.

See above. Don't quit your day job.

By leisure, I don't mean an easy lifestyle (by any means). I'm talking 
about an artist who thinks he/she can spend the minimal amount of effort 
to put together a product and expect to make money off of it and feel 
important. An artist who cares for nothing but money and the quickest 
and simplest route to get it. Contrasted to the working artist who knows 
the score, and lives and loves their art every minute of the day (money or 
no). 

It seems that the whole reason there's a fuss about this is because it's 
on cd. Well <knock,knock> what happens when all recording is digital? 
It's not that far away. We've already got a handful of formats. All it 
will take is for the prices to fall (which they will soon enough). Time 
to start planning for the future and how you'll deal with it, because you 
just won't stop it. Nobody can and nobody will.

JMAR. That movie scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid.

To summarize the advisory, people who are in danger are the people 
who use telnet, rlogin, or ftp to connect to their site. Seems that 
passwords are sent over the networks as plaintext (what were they 
thinking?). People who have hacked root accounts can monitor and record 
the first 128 keystrokes of these remote logins, usually enough to 
capture your userid and password. If you connect to your system directly, 
this problem doesn't affect you. Still, it's a good idea to review and/or 
change your current password anyway. Get in the habit.

This might seem like a dumb question, but even if I change my passwords,
what's to stop whoever's doing this clandestine monitoring to intercept
it in the future?  Like tonight?

Do we now have to change passwords every day or something?

How much does it matter whether we have superuser priveleges at the
site we're telnet/FTP'ing into?

Again, from the advisory, a temporary solution has been proposed by 
asking systems who do not use the porgram the hackers are making use of 
to remove it. At least make sure it is monitored. The longer term 
solution is to make sure all userids and passwords are not passed as 
plain text over the network. They're working on that one. And no, you 
don't have to change your password every day. Ask your sysadmin on the 
status of your system.

Not much in vulnerability. But be sure your account, if hacked by them, 
will see more illlegal use than the account of joe user. Keep an eye on 
your account if the above is true. JMAR.

It only gets worse if you, as an individual, support it by buying the
stuff.  That is YOUR choice.  You can't fob it off by saying "oh, everyone
does it and it's going to get worse so it's really OK." -- that is, if
you're trying to justify it.  If what you're really saying is "I don't
care if other people profit off of work I haven't made a cent from",
that's your choice.  Just don't try to sugarcoat it with some lame
excuse about everyone else doing it.

Yes, but these are the people being hurt by these comp CDs.  Garth and

What does this have to do with anything?  Garth and the label are making

Any dance single is sold with the assumption that it is for DJ use.  Some
even state this explicitly.  The theory is that people listen to it, like
it, and buy it.

Your logic is based on incorrect assumptions and a frightening degree

Credit the artists and pay them.  It's very easy.

Yes!  It is very easy to do mix tapes right.  Credit the artists and give
them their due.

I'm a musician, and a programmer, and a hell of a lot of other things,
and your condescending attitude really pisses me off.  I am not asking
for art to be easy, or anything else.  I am pointing out that if you
are going to pay people for the privilege of listening to excellent
music, you should pay the people who make it as well as the people who
mix it.

If you accept that "that's the way it is", continue to act like "that's
the way it is", and support with your cash "the way it is", guess what --
things won't change!  YOUR actions determine the way things are, and
blaming problems on the status quo won't change that.

You are responsible for your actions, which determine "the way it is".
Sadly, many people spend a lot of time pointing fingers at everyone else
and saying "it's their fault".

 Money or no, I keep designing because it's

Great!  So do I, which means I don't want to support people who rip off
others doing the same.

They have.  CDs cost about a buck.  Why do you think it pisses me off to 
see artists not get paid when the end product costs $20?

***** POSITIVE IDEA FOLLOWS *****
I would love to distribute my music shareware.  I'll make 8-bit 10K mono
versions available for ftp free, and if you want 44.1K stereo you send me
a few bucks.  Cuts out all the middlemen.  How's that for a constructive
solution to our problem?

   This might seem like a dumb question, but even if I change my passwords,
   what's to stop whoever's doing this clandestine monitoring to intercept
   it in the future?  Like tonight?

[there are gazillions of possible network setups, i'm only covering some.
 there also are gazillions of 'only if but not if's]

the CERT advisory deals with network monitoring, exploiting the /dev/nit
(or equivalent) interface.  nit stands for Network Interface Tap.  it's a
way to nonintrusively watch packets that come over the net.  one common
name for a machine that's snooping the net is a 'sniffer'.

a lot depends on how you're connected.  how many 'boxes' do you have to go
through in order to login?  are they in the same subnet?  is your subnet
routed?  where's the sniffer?  say you rlogin from one host to another.  if
both hosts are on the same subnet behind a router that doesn't forward
local packets to another network and if the sniffer is not on your subnet,
then you're safe cuz sniffer will never see the packets holding your
password.  but as soon as you do an rlogin or telnet to another machine,
one that will take your packets over the same wire the sniffer is on then
everything you type and see can be captured.  this only applies to network
connections.  terminal dialups are a different story.

if you're going through a modem-pool that has serial lines going directly
into the box you're logging into, then your password does not go over the
net and no network sniffer will see it.  again, as soon as you rlogin or
telnet to another machine then the above applies.

   Do we now have to change passwords every day or something?

people who do change their passwords every day usually follow some formula.
so...  if you're running NIS (YP) which most people are, then when you
change your password using yppasswd (or passwd), your old password goes
cleartext across the net to the yp server in the rpc request.  i guess they
were assuming you'll change your password anyway so it wouldn't hurt.
unfortunately, your sniffer can keep track of your old passwords and guess
the next...

   How much does it matter whether we have superuser priveleges at the
   site we're telnet/FTP'ing into?

again, what matters is whether you can trust the wire enroute to your
telnet/ftp destination.  the nets at both ends may be secure but what about
everything in between?  this is why you never do root logins across unknown
nets.

one solution is run full kerberos, or use modified
rlogin(d)/telnet(d)/ftp(d) clients/servers that do encryption.

feel free to mail or call me if you questions...

Subject: explain this to me
Status: 


I have multiple crates of vinyl that I have bought in DJ shops to be 
used DJing.

The vast majority of this stuff has something on it like the following:

"All rights of the manufacturer and of the owner of the recorded work
reserved, unauthorized copying, lending, hiring, public perfornace,
diffusion, and broadcasting of this recording prohibited."

So tell me, how in good consience can any DJ record store sell this
stuff to anyone who isn't a well-known DJ with regular club gigs (this
is asked with the assumption that a club will be properly registered
with ASCAP and/or BMI)?

How, in good consience, can any DJ at all play this stuff anywhere
except in their own homes?  According to the above statement, they
can't even play that particular record in a club that pays the right 
ASCAP and BMI fees.

So how is it REALLY supposed to work?  Are DJs only allowed to spin
white lables and copies that are stamped "lent for promotional use
only?"

What I'm getting at is the current system forces DJs to break the 
rules in the strictest sense.  In order to be fair monitarily to the
artists and be fair access-wise to the DJs, the whole system has to
change.

Okay, say I make a mix tape and want to get permission to sell it.
Say it's a 90 minute tape with about 25 tracks on it.  Say those 25
tracks come from 20 different record companies.  Under the current
system I'd have to write to each one and possibly send each one a 
copy of the tape.  Then I have to wait for the company to contact the 
artist and get their say on it.  By this time so much time has gone by 
that the music is stale and no one will want the tape anymore anyway.

Perhaps if all I had to do was send in a short form (with basically
my name and address and the track's name, really simply) and a small
"share" fee to REGISTER my use, that would be acceptible.  The artist
gets all the money from the "share" fee, and I get to get my tape out
very quickly.  If someone gets my tape and looks up all the share
registrations and found out I didn't do them all, then my butt is 
grass.

Well, it's an idea.  Of course, the cost of the "share" multiplied
by 25 (number of tracks) would make it too expensive for someone getting
started as a DJ to cope . . . but if they program a good tape and
mix it up well then it will be worth the price they ask, so I guess
that works out.

As a community of ravers we should try to do something.  Consatnt talk
about raves changing the world has always left me disappointed as I never
see much coming out of the raves I go to except occasional donations to  a
charity or person in our scene.  There are a tleast 300 people on sfraves.
300 x $20 each equals about sixthousand dollars.  We could actually do
something that would test our ability as a community to organize, trust and
communicate with ideas.  I was thinking along the lines of trying to throw
a party once a month, an sfraves party, with the base amount of money we
can collect (this is only in theory) and doing something with any money
made and then keeping that base money.  Nobody would ever make profit that
is in sfraves.  Rsponsibilities would have to be on a volunteer basis.
Deciding who might be in charge would be hard but necessary.  We have a lot
of resourses to use.  Hopefully everyone could participate in a way maybe
switching around tasks monthly.  Please respond to these ideas with your
thoughts.  I think this is something we should try to do.  Let's start
making raves a community effort where we can all particpate.  Help me
elaborate these thoughts and we can start to do something.  The beginning
is near.

Well, Cd's cost "about a buck" in lots of 1000, not counting printing,

at least who want a 100% mark up.  Also, DJ tapes cost about $15, so

I think the concept of shareware music is going to be the major paradigm
in 20 years, if not in 10 and optimistically in 5.  

BTW, if you or anyone else wants to put up sound files (8-bit 8 khz mono
.au, yes it sucks, but it's the only truely ubiquitous sound format as
of now) on techno.stanford.edu for anonymous FTP/gopher/WWW access, let
me know.  I have a library of a bunch of digitized snippets of songs,
fully credited, as well as 5 1/2 hour 15 megs DJ sets (those are welcome
too).

My final comment is that JMAR is right when he says that putting out
CD's without crediting the songs is barely different than going to a
rave, paying $20, and hearing those songs, also uncredited.  It's not
like they hand out playlists at parties, but conversely if you hang
around and ask the right questions youcan pretty much always find out 
what song was just played if you really like it.

I don't know anyone who's said, "Well, I got Spun's CD now.  Guess I
won't have to go out and buy Freaky Chakra!".

	I think that the concept of shareware for *all* easily
reproducible products (books, software, etc.) will be the major
paradigm. I think the fundamental technology necessary for shareware
is making it *easy* to pay for-- lower the transaction costs.
	If I picked up a peice of software/music which I liked a lot
from some ftp site, and it said, "If you like this, send a $5 check to
Joe Author", I probably wouldn't do it. But, if it said, if you like

the First Bank of the Internet to Joe Author, I would likely do it...

Thus proving my point, which is that none of the money is going to the artist.

In what language?  They cost about 50c more to produce.  The only reason
that they cost more is that we are willing to pay a premium on it.  Most
underground punk labels sell full-length CDs for under $10 ppd.  Fugazi
has sold close to a million this way at $8 each, $6 for the vinyl.

Multiply that time times the number of good songs and you quickly end
up with an unmanageable number.

More likely I'd say "I like that track but don't know what it is."
Most people aren't as close to the 'scene' as you, Brian, and don't
have easy access to people with encyclopedic knowledge of the
latest music.  I've been trying to ID a break track for over a year
and still not succeeded.

So let me follow your logic... I pay $20 dollars and buy a Garth CD, he
gets ALL the money (let's say), the artists get zip.  I go around and play
it on my high quality stereo for my friends, shit maybe even have a party
and charge people a few bucks to enjoy the music, so let's see maybe over the
6 months or so that I do this 500 people get a listening to this music
that their enjoyment isn't filtering back to the artist in a monetary fashion.  

Now let's juxtapose(sp?) this situation with Jason (or Heather) Promoter
who has been having several successful underground parties.  They pack them
In at $15 a head and each party has 300 people, at the end of the night s/he
(being an honest promoter) pays her crew and the DJs, but not the artists that
the DJs played (she doesn't pay ASCAP fees) seems like you are going after
the wrong person if it is just a question of "looking out for the artist"
because the naked truth is that as far as cashflow is concerned, the promoter
is the recipient of the take at the door and doles out the money to the 
"usual suspects".  There is FAR MORE money available for artist by getting
illegal raves to fess up their ASCAP dues then to go after mixtapes/cds.
So now the question is are you the one who has been calling the cops on
undergrounds because they don't pay their ASCAP fees? By YOUR logic, this
would be the appropriate action for you to take if you are so concerned
with the artist getting their due, but of course actions like this would 
KILL the scene quick (you might even get killed also in the process :),
and you don't want that because, despite your rhetoric, YOU are a profiteer
of the scene as well.  The only reason that you are attacking the CD issue
(and mixtapes) is that you have this old skin, lame view that these things cut
into the sale of 12" which is how you make YOUR money.  Don't come with
that coy bullshit about the artist getting ripped off, you, my friend are
just as much a conspiritor as Garth, Spun, and the mixtape/CD manufacturer.
Maybe the clear solution is that the record sellers should tack the ASCAP/BMI
fees on to DJ specific music, but hey, that would mean work for YOU, can
you say in your heart (that is bleeding for all of these ripped off artists)
that you would faithfully pay your fair share of you profit to ASCAP/BMI so
that these exploited artists can eat?  I don't think so.

That's the record companies theory.
I bet if you talk to many (but not all) of the artists who make 
music for the Scene, their primary mission is to make music that
is HEARD and DANCED to internationally,  this Scene is NOT about ASCAP,
BMI, IRS, SSN ,FTB, Liquior Board or any other money grubbing pack of
gangsters who supposedly are collecting their "fair share" for the
underdog.

Yeah and writing letters to ASCAP/BMI is not going to solve things either.
This kind of behavior is reprehensible in the Scene.  And as far as I'm
concerned I'll never buy any records from gaia-mantra or any other store
that would do such a thing, and further more I would tell every DJ that I
came across not to buy from there as well.

Giamma I could do the hardware... I could bring about 4 Macs and a UNIX box
with a 14.4k net connection, and provide enough AppleTalk IP feeds for
anyone who wanted to bring a Mac of their own... Indeed, I set up my whole
system exactly in order to do stuff like this.

It would be sorta like the Net-jam thingees I was doing down at Stanford
last year. We could have a bunch of people v-raving, or go on group trips
to MUD's, or do guided Mosaic tours (I guess this could get kinda slow...).

I'd need some help moving hardware and setting things up, though...

Subject: My philosophy, an explanation, and a possible solution
Status: 


For anyone who has written me off as a total ass, or those who are
considering it, please do me one courtesy before ignoring me entirely
and read this.  I feel I have been misrepresented by people who are
arguing points I have not stated, and positions I did not take, and
since I do not have the courtesy not to bite back when insulted I have
come off as a lot more abrasive than I usually am.

===

These are my last words on the subject.  This is what I believe, and what I
propose.

I believe Frank Zappa when he stated simply "Music is the best."
I believe that making music is its own reward, and that any profit
gained from it is an unexpected bonus.
I believe that it is good to support those who make music, and bad
to support those who distribute or repackage it without the artist's 
consent.
I believe that by choosing to buy or not buy a piece of music, I
can support those who act in accordance with my beliefs.

I propose that artists state clearly their desired degree of control 
over their music, and that distributors and DJs respect the desires
of the artists.

I do not believe in forcing anyone to act in accordance with my
beliefs.

===

Some notes: If things worked like this, those whose music comes first
would get heard more, and those who were just grubbing for money would
get heard less.

My contention is that the choice should be left to the artist, and not
to someone who _just happens_ to profit from assuming a certain 
motivation on the part of the artist.

To me, informing on someone is the same, if not worse, than forcing
them myself.  I will not do this.

I hope I have not permanently alienated anyone by my tone.  I do
not, however, retract nor regret the substance of anything I have said.
I hope this makes clear my intentions.

===

My choice of distribution would be (and will, if I ever get the damn
stuff off of Beta PCM and onto DAT so I can master it) something like
this.  I hate legal boilerplate, but it is sometimes necessary
to protect oneself by using it.  Sometimes the line between asshole
and victim is very thin.

there seem to be two general threads here.  one is that we should have
more collective activity.  i submit that things have been slow
recently only because it's been winter... renegade season is just
around the corner and i for one am damn excited.  you'll see a lot
more SFR related events coming up... and actually, props to Ethan and
Bryce for working double-overtime to give us some free events during
the winter (at personal expense, no less) --- last winter was a lot
more static, not nearly as much going on.

the other point is more interesting and is something which i can only
offer a bit on.  it's hard enough to get SFR people out for a free
event sometimes.  it seems to me that it would be impossible to get
them to come out for a $20 event, even for a charity.  on the other
hand, SFR has the people and the resources and the knowledge to
organize a rave for charity.  it wouldn't be that hard to get the
promoters to help us out (someone on the list knows just about every
promoter) and the same goes for the DJs.  if we were going for the
entire community to attend and not just SFR, i bet we could get a
great turnout.  unfortunately someone has to front all the cash for
the event, and spaces for 500+ people don't come cheap.  (it seems to
me that if the event is for a charity, the space needs to be legal.)

now, on the other hand, if there is a charity who has a space we could
use, that would make complete and total sense.

just a few random thoughts...
Bob

this was one of the best events i've been to.

i've never been in DV8 (strangely enough) but liked the space, the 3rd
floor.  good ambient room with interesting musik, i lapsed into
semi-consciousness around 10:30 (got there early early early)...

by midnight the main room was going off pretty well.  the party got
comfortably crowded and rather hot in the two-ish time frame, but
never was too much to handle.

dubtribe turned in an awesome set, and the DJs did a very competent
job.  is it me, or was the music a bit faster and more interesting
than what i have heard garth play recently?

saw a good number of folkx, but it seems many people missed this one.
a shame!  one of the best parties i've been to with a great mix of old
friends, SFRavers and friendly new people...

good lighting too :-)

Well, we as a community (by which I mean the WHOLE house community with
SFR playing an integral part) have done exactly what you're talking about,
drenalin.  It was a while ago -- back in Sept. '92, a really key month for
the scene and SFR in particular.  A committee of all the major organizers
got permits to hold an event at the GG Park bandshell (where the Organic
event was held last weekend), and Brian and I attended the meetings, and
decided we would be responsible for the collection of funds (voluntary
donations).  On top of that, we essentially selected the major recipient
of the proceeds, and we delivered the cash to both beneficiaries.

What was done before *can* be done again -- I have an idea for another
outdoor event somewhere *much* nicer than GG Park, a space that can be
rented legally for almost no money at all.  My proposal is that SFR be
the core of the planning effort, but that we involve other key promoters
in organizing and publicizing, with their party names on the flyers as an
endorsement.  There's been some discussion about this on the sfraves-planners
list, and probably sometime soon we'll call a meeting for all to attend
to start planning and organizing.  I'd like to schedule the party for when
the weather gets a little more predictable, probably late April or early May.

Now that several key promoters are on this mailing list, perhaps we have
more power than ever to throw a tremendous party and raise maybe $1000-$2000
or more for a worthy cause.

The KEY thing to remember about this event is that it's not going to be
an EXCLUSIVELY SFR thing, but we will be providing most of the organization
and planning, and keeping it open to all people on or off the list to
contribute what they can.  SFR is but one clan in the larger fabric of this
community, and we want all to be involved.

Below is my review of that event, courtesy of the SFR archives.  The
party was held the afternoon after the first FMR at Bonny Doon, which
itself was a coup for SFR, since we had "broken in" the site with Connection
I.  The charity party might have even done better if it hadn't been in the
shadow (afterparty?) of the FMR.

INTRODUCTION:  RECLAIMING THE AIRWAVES!
Let a thousand transmitters bloom

by Stephen Dunifer, Free Radio Berkeley

Using inexpensive hand-built transmitters, micro-power
broadcasters such as Free Radio Berkeley and Black Liberation
Radio in Springfield, IL, are challenging the information
stranglehold imposed by the corporate media and enforced by
federal regulation.  Micro-radio is a First Amendment challenge to
restrictive federal regulations which only favor those with money
and power.

Most communities are denied their own voice.  Unless one has at
least $50,000 to start a 100 watt FM station, there is no way any
community without those resources can have a voice.  Before 1980
it was possible to apply for and receive a 10 watt Class D
educational station license with very little money in the bank.
Thanks to an alliance of reactionary elements, who sought to
suppress voices outside the mainstream, and liberal elements such
as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (NPR), who sought to
establish more "professional" stations (translation:  more likely
to be funded by corporate blood money laundered through
foundations), the FCC eliminated all 10 watt station licenses as
of 1980.  This move prevented the 90% of the U.S. population who
do not have the monetary resources from having a voice on the FM
band;  especially African Americans who are underrepresented in
the media by 600%.

If the airwaves were not dominated by the corporate media pirates,
there would be plenty of FM radio spectrum space available for all
to use.  Even in the congested Bay Area FM radio spectrum, there
are quite a number of frequencies that would be appropriate for
low power (.5 to 10 watts) community broadcast operations.
Unfortunately, like so many other public resources such as old
growth forests, the air waves have been hijacked and polluted by
the corporate state in its relentless pursuit of profit and
control of all public resources.

In response, there is a growing movement of individuals and
communities who have set up micro-power (.5 to 10 watts)
broadcasting operations.  Most notable of these is Black
Liberation Radio, which covers a housing project area in Illinois.
Black Liberation Radio has been under severe attack by both the
local police and federal agencies.  Despite police and federal
harassment, Black Liberation Radio is on 24 hours a day offering
some of the finest programs to be found anywhere on almost no
budget.

Frightened by this growing movement, the FCC comes knocking at
doors, slapping fines ranging anywhere from $750 to $20,000.  This
booklet is to help you deal with the FCC's tactics to stifle our
right to communicate with each other.

Just imagine the possibilities of having hundreds of micro-power
broadcasts like this across the country.  Cost is not a problem
since a basic station can be put on the air for less than $200.
Soon, an inexpensive UHF TV transmitter design will be available
as well.  With determination and purpose we can break the
stranglehold on the flow of cultural and artistic expression
information and ideas in this country.

WHEN THE FCC KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR

NOTE:  The following discussion assumes that you are not a
licensed broadcaster.

Q)  If FCC agents knock on my door and say they want to talk with
me, do I have to answer their questions?

A:  No.  You have a right to say that you want a lawyer present
when and if you speak with them, and that if they will give you
their names, you will be back in touch with them.  Unless you have
been licensed to broadcast, the FCC has no right to "inspect" your
home.

Q)  If they say they have a right to enter my house without a
warrant to see if I have broadcasting equipment, do I have to let
them in?

A:  No.  Under Section 303(n)  of Title 47 U.S.C., the FCC has a
right to inspect any transmitting devices that must be licensed
under the Act.  Nonetheless, they must have permission to enter
your home, or some other basis for entering beyond their mere
supervisorial powers.  With proper notice, they do have a right to
inspect your communications devices.  If they have given you
notice of a pending investigation, contact a lawyer immediately.

Q)  If they have evidence that I am "illegally" broadcasting from
my home, can they enter anyway, even without a warrant or without
my permission?

A:  They will have to go to court to obtain a warrant to enter
your home.  But, if they have probable cause to believe you are
currently engaging in illegal activities of any sort, they, with
the assistance of the local police, can enter your home without a
warrant to prevent those activities from continuing.   Basically,
they need either a warrant, or probable cause to believe a crime
is going on at the time they are entering your home.

Q)  If I do not cooperate with their investigation, and they
threaten to arrest me, or have me arrested,  should I cooperate
with them?

A:  If they have a legal basis for arresting you, it is very
likely that they will prosecute you regardless of what you say.
Therefore, what you say will only assist them in making a stronger
case against you.  Do not speak to them without a lawyer there.

Q)  If they have an arrest or a search warrant, should I let them
in my house?

A:  Yes.  Give them your name and address, and tell them that you
want to have your lawyer contacted immediately before you answer
any more questions.  If you are arrested, you have a right to make
several telephone calls within 3 hours of booking.

Q)  Other than an FCC fine for engaging in illegal transmissions,
what other risks do I take in engaging in micro-radio broadcasts.

A:  Section 501 of the Act provides that violations of the Act can
result in the imposition of a $10,000 fine or by imprisonment for
a term not exceeding one year, or both.  A second conviction
results in a potentially longer sentence.  If you are prosecuted
under this section of the Act, and you are indigent (unable to
hire an attorney), the court will have to appoint one for you.

Q)  Are there any other penalties that can be imposed upon me for
"illegal broadcasts."

A:  Under Section 510 of the Act, the FCC can attempt to have your
communicating equipment seized and forfeited for violation of the
requirements set forth in the Act.  Once again, if they attempt to
do this, you will be given notice of action against you, and have
an opportunity to appear in court to fight the FCC's proposed
action. Realize, though, that they will try to keep your equipment
and any other property they can justify retaining until the
proceedings are completed.  You have a right to seek return of
your property from the court at any time.

Q)  If the FCC agents ask me if I knew I was engaged in illegal
activities, should I deny any knowledge of FCC laws or any illegal
activities?

A:  No.  You will have plenty of time to answer their accusations
after you have spoken with an attorney.  It is a separate crime to
lie to law enforcement officials about material facts.  Remain
silent.

Q)  If I am considering broadcasting over micro-radio, is there
anything I can do ahead of time to minimize the liklihood of
prosecution?

A:  Yes.  Speak with an attorney before you are approached by law
enforcement to discuss the different aspects of FCC law.  Arrange
ahead of time for someone to represent you when and if the
situation arises, so that you will already have prepared a
strategy of defense.

Q)  What can I do if the FCC agents try to harass me by going to
my landlord, or some other source to apply pressure on me?

A:  So long as there is no proof that you have violated the law,
you cannot be prosecuted or evicted.  If there is evidence of
misconduct, you might have to defend yourself in court.  Depending
upon what the FCC said or did, you might be able to raise a
defense involving selective prosecution or other equivalent
argument.  If the conduct of the agents is clearly harassment,
rather than a proper investigation, you can file a complaint with
the F.C.C. or possibly a civil action against them.

Q)  If I want to legally pursue FCC licensing for a new FM
station, what should I do?

A:  It isn't the purpose of this Q and A sheet to advocate or
discourage non-licensed broadcast operations.  A person cited by
the FCC for illegal broadcasting will find it virtually impossible
to later obtain permission to get a license.  If you want to
pursue the licensing procedure, see the procedures set forth in
the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 73.  The
application form (Form # 301 A) is extremely complicated, and
requires a filing fee of $2,030.00.  If you want to contact the
FCC directly, call them at their Consumer Assistance and Small
Business Division, Room 254, 1919 N St. NW, Washington, D.C.
20554, tel (202) 632-7260.  Don't bother to try this without
significant financial backing.

Hold on. I was going to just drop this all until this popped up. Where 
are you getting the idea that I think it's right to steal an artist's work. 
I've had my stuff stolen as well and know how shitty it is.

What I'm *trying* to do is inject a little reality-check into this 
discussion. When your ship is sinking, you don't deny the fact that you 
are soon going to be underwater. You try to do something about it. If you 
can't fix the ship, you'd better learn how to swim. That's nihilistic? I 
was trying to focus the discussion away from things that we can't change 
to the things we *can*.

Theft is there, as much as you or I dislike it, but it's only a symptom 
of the problem. You have to find the reason it exists in the first place 
and work on that or it won't go away.

specializing in auditory crowd control, making people happy and keeping 
the ultimate end-users who indirectly fund a big chunk of this whole 
industry interested in the music in the first place. They need to make 
money just as much as the musician does, and the ones that I do know of 
don't make that much either. Mix-tapes are important to them for 
promotion, especially when starting out. As they grow, and as more DJs 
start popping up, it's important to be able to distinguish themselves out 
of the crowd so they can keep spinning. A mix-tape can help them reach 
more people who might just then stop by their party next time (because of 
the mix, energy and *type* of music they play, not any specific track).

	SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A San Francisco Superior Court judge has struck
down a city ordinance prohibiting dance halls that cater to teenagers
and young adults from operating between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., saying it is
unconstitutional.
	Judge William Cahill said the ordinance is too too broad because it
prohibits people between 18 and 21 years old from being at any site
where there is an instrument or device capable of producing or
reproducing sound, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
	The ruling is a blow to the city's efforts to crack down on late-
night dance clubs that police contend contribute to neighborhood crime.
	But the battle apparently isn't over yet. Attorney Larry Murray, who
is representing the dance halls, said city officials are trying to use a
law requiring clubs that allow dancing after midnight to apply for
permits.
	Murray said he has filed a second lawsuit challenging that practice
and expects a ruling in the next few months.

DJs are important in any scene, and without their effort, the larger 
listening audience for techno and house would have dried up or at least 
dwindled (or never happened in the first place) a long time ago. In the 
end, it pays to keep them working and earning money too. Now it seems 
that noone has a problem with promo mix-tapes, just those for profit and 
those without credits. Well, just how much profit is made off of most of 
these. I'd be shocked if it was any appreciable amount. And I'd be even 
more shocked if a good portion of this money went into anything other 
than keeping a DJ career going (read: buying more records). If I'm wrong 
and someone is intentionally making a bundle off of this, then yes 
they're not promoting, they're pirating and should be dealt with. 

As for credits, well we've already seen/read about the legal roadblocks 
in the way. A DJ who lists tracks on a (on even a break even) tape is 
putting themselves in jeopardy of a nice lawsuit unless they leave off 
*their* credit (which makes the whole effort useless). Mix-tapes are also 
pretty time-sensitive. A DJ wants people to hear what he/she sounds like 
now, not five/six months ago. (as per Laura) Stale music kills a tape. And 
by then, your record is probably sold out anyway, nullifying any extra 
purchases you would have received from the promotion.

Any solution to this mess has to provide the DJ with a quick and easy way 
to put their tape together legally. If not, the present situation will 
unfortunately continue. First off, nobody can ask you about using your 
music if you don't put any information on your releases. Luckily grigsby, 
from your last post, you seem to already  realize this and then some. I 
never understood the 'white label' unless of course, the music itself
is lifted from another source. Second, maybe ease up on the amount of 
verbiage needed for the credit. If I really want to buy something, all I 
need is your name, the title and (maybe) the record company. If I've got 
that, I can find it. Maybe give a price break to DJs who'll include more. 
As for the copyright, "all works are licensed from the original copyright 
holders and remain the property of the original copyright holders" or 
something a little more legally sound at the end should do the trick.

Finally, why not try a little (I *know* it's a dirty word) marketing? The 
people who buy mix-tapes for the music, buy them because they don't know 
where else to get it. If you give them a better way to hear you, it just 
might make the whole 'commercial' promo-tape deal moot. The Internet 
Music Archives idea is good. I visit there myself. But what about all the 
people who don't have live internet (are there any? <g>). Do something to 
distinguish yourself out of the crowd of a hundred other nameless records 
in the store. Funny enough, I've found some of my favorite artists 
through great cover art (long live Designer's Republic). Mix up a few 
cheap promo tapes of your own and pass them out at a party or sell them 
for cheap at a store. Word of mouth takes over from there. Announce your 
releases, non-commercial use be damned, on internet even. This may all be 
unimportant to DJs who have the time to go through lots of music, but it 
is important to the listeners who don't (and who are the ones who are 
supposedly buying all these mix-tapes). Mystery is fun, I love it, but 
(unless done properly e.g. Hafler Trio) it won't get you your money.

Of course the flip-side of the coin is that music that is a popular 
purchase for non-djs is generally not a popular play for DJs. I hear 
Orbital every once in a while, but who hears a DJ play the Orb (no matter 
how many times the Musicland in Bobsville has sold out). Aphex Twin is 
the next to go. Heard it only one or two times in the last few months. DJs 
seem to thrive on obscurity for their playlist (my opinion). Don't know if 
this forces a choice or what it means to a musician, just an observation.

All in all, if you can make this work, great. I *do* want to buy your music
and not a mix-tape, but I need you to want to sell to me and other listeners 
and not just DJs. Whatever happens, hopefully everyone will be happier. 
That's it for my last public post on this. Flame away or discuss my 
opinion with me directly. All I apologize for is my verbosity. JMAR.

One time, I was driving like a batoutahell down from Seattle.
Approaching a little burg, I slowed down to 55, but MISSED the 35MPH
sign at the edge of town.  Must have been the fog . . . .

After the standard BS of getting a ticket (which is now new and
improved in Oregon since it is a crime not to be able to prove your
car is insured at any time you are operating it), the following
conversation occured.

Officer: "Here's your ticket.  You're free to go.  However, I am
concerned that there may be drugs or weapons in your car.  Do you use
drugs?"

Me: "Oh, no sir!"

Officer: "Have you ever used a weapon?"

Me: (momentarily thrown by the bizzare implications of a broad
interpretation of the question) "Um, no, I guess not."

Officer: "Would you mind if I searched your car for drugs and
weapons?"

Me: "Yes, I would mind."

Note that the request to search was asked in the negative, tricky,
tricky, tricky.  Note that the answer made clear the driver's desire
to not be searched.  "I do not want you to search my car." might have
been a better answer.

Oh yeah, I was also clean.


> I wish that I could know that I would have enough strength to do that,
> I doubt myself in this respect. But it's something to think about.

I dunno, for me, it didn't even occur to me to consent to the search,
because I knew he was fishing.  If he'd had cause I would already be
in the middle of having my ass searched.  Playing that stoopid word
game with me made it easy.  All I had to do was figure out how to not
accidentally consent to a search.

It seems to me that not being clean would make it all the more
important to win the word game.  Sweating bullets is not a crime.  If
officer fiendly ASKS you for permission to search, think for a second,
then stammer out that you do not consent to a search.  Look at it this
way, if you get asked, you're almost home free!  Just say "No."  Or
"Yes."  Or whatever.

As far as getting pulled over to begin with, many jurisdiction use
"profiles" of suspected drug smugglers and what have you.  As I
recall, Texas used a profile something like this:

- travelling just under the speed limit
- travelling alone
- map on passenger seat
- some other stuff I can't remember

So, travelling the speed limit may have its drawbacks (they can get
you for other things, tail lights, license-plate lights, crossing
center line, failure to signal 100" before turning or changing lanes,
and so on).

A little story about a car search:

Junior year in High School and my parents are out of town for a week.
Friday night, big home football game. A good friend thinks it would be a
great idea to invite the entire stadium over to my house after the game. I
am not there to decline the invitation.

More than 250 people show up at my house after the game. Talk about peer
pressure. I consent to the party and proceed to have a great time.

1:30am, as the quarter rolls off my nose into the glass...

Mr. Cop1 and Mr. Cop2 show up, bust the party, and warn me to stay out of
trouble.

Saturday night - I invite several friends over again.

I am on my way back from picking up a friend from work. He has brought with
him a fifth of Bacardi Rum, and another friend. He ask me to stop in at the
7-ll on the way home. We go in the store, purchase some non-alcoholic
mixers, and leave the store.

As I am getting into my car, Mr. Cop1 pulls in behind my car (which is
still in the parking space in the parking lot) and turns on his lights and
siren (like this was really necessary).

He ask all of us to get of of the car. He ask me if he could search my car.
I immediately refuse. He says that he saw us leave the store with
non-alcoholic mixers and therefore has probable cause to search the car.

I tell him that I dont think he has probable cause, and the he should show
me a search warrant. He gives me an ultimatum... Hand over all alcoholic
and non-alcoholic beverages that are in the car, or he will search the car,
and arrest me if he finds anything.

I argue... "Just because we purchased mixers here, does not mean that we
have alcohol in the car. We have plenty of alcohol back home. :)"

Then he responds. "I know, I am the cop that busted your party last night.
I will return with a warrant to search your car."

Mr. Cop1 walks back to his car, and calls something in on his radio.

This is the first time I actually felt intimidated. While he was in the
car, we decided to give in and and get the bottle of rum out of the car.
When he came back he saw us with it and remarked... "Smart move fellows -
Ya'll were about to get arrested... Now I want you to open up the bottle
and pour it all out right here in the parking lot"


GlubGlubGlubGlubGlubGlubGlubGlub....All gone!

"Thanks for co-operating. I will be patrolling your neighborhood tonight,
so dont even attempt another party! Good evening, and stay out of trouble"

We return to my house, and continue to have a great evening.

When my parents return, I tell them the whole story. The were upset that I
had such a huge party, but also were upset that I was harassed by the
police. They consult Mr. Lawyer and Mr. Lawyer said...

"The cops probably did not have probable cause to search your car, but they
do have lots of power to interpret the law as they choose for any
situation. They are really into harassing underage drinkers, and since it
was the cop that busted your party, probably felt that he really had a need
to rid us of our alcoholic possession and harrass us at the same time. You
made the correct move by handing over the alcohol, otherwise you may have
spent the night in jail."

Ahhh... Memories....

so long

No.  Information is cool.  It's solicitating money or selling stuff
that would require us to deal with another set of rules and fees.

BTW everybody, an SFR sponsered GG Park party is being planned for

This last WICKED went off brilliantly.  The space was totally new 
literaly right around the block from the tenderloin police station!

Instead of partying, this night, I was working.  My job was to "work the door"
and do "security" and make sure folks are taken care of, so when they told me
the location, I thought they were completely MAD! But it worked flawlessly.

The space was a basement art gallery, with two large rooms that we filled
with sound reinforcement equipment  6 stacks of Comunity's in the outer room
and 8 stacks in the "main" room.  This event had a mappoint (remember those?)
on Howard street where people paid and received their ticket and directions
(verbal) to the party.  No money was taken at the door.  The Posse had their 
act together this time and the party started more or less on time with Jeno
dropping the first beat at about Midnight, It just got better from there.
Jeno, as some of you "craker jacks" on the list can attest, totally fuck it up.
Gone was the tired sets that he has been known to play recently, maybe there
is truth to the rumor that Jeno plays his best "when his back's to the wall
and the police are at the door", still I think he gets off on the energy of
underground parties. My responsibility was to get people in off the streets
(not too hard considering the weather) make sure that people don't bum-rush
the door, and to generally spread the Vibe.  By 1 a.m Jeno was kicking serious
butt on the dancefloor, the music was LOUD in the space but only mildly
audible outside, we stuffed some sound insolation in a couple of the remaining
"holes" that some of the treble could leak out and basically , from the ouitside
it sounded like a (veery good) band rehersal. By 2 a.m. I expected the fuzz
any minute, I had seen a couple of cruisers drive by quickly but I think
the rain helped in that:

			1) People didn't loiter near their cars.
			2) It was so cold and wet that the Police
			  in the cruisers I know must have had their 
			  windows up and the heat on, so they didn't
			  hear even the little amount of music that leaked
			  through.

2 a.m. came and Makie came on and started playing some sick shit that made
eveybody go completely off, this was some serious Acid House.

The temperature in the main room was pretty high but the loosely enforced 
ban on smoking and the large fans kept the climate bearable.  By 3 a.m.
Makkie was doin it and still no sign of the police.  By 4:00 I began to
smile cuz' I knew the cops weren't commin and probably didn't even know
we were there.  Garth came on at 4, I think he must have bought some new
records, I'm glad :) and Thomas closed from 6 -8 a spot that is not usualy
his but he did really well in.  All in all a very successful party in a very
ballsy location.  It reminded me of this piece of vietnam war history where
the Viet Cong launced and co-ordinated a major military offensive from an
underground command post DUG UNDERNEATH the US military's command post

	is it alright with you if we have an INFO booth of sorts?
I'd like to see info distributed on the following things...


	Substance info flyers
	Nutrition
	Try to get a Rave-Med program going for the summer months (I'll 
	work on this)

	And what I call "out reach" maybe have copies of the alt.rave FAQ
	to hand out to press and others.  Talk to passer-by about the scene
	especially cops and such.

It's probably a good idea to have seperate tables, that way one messsage
can be seperated from the others.

Bob Jesse might even want to set uo something.

This is a great idea.  I encourage people to distribute anything that they 
feel is anyway related to any of the things that the House scene represents
The idea of voter registration tables has also been bandied about.
Nonutilitarian information could also be included; Art work, poetry, 
essays -  maybe even the entire unedited SFRaves archives :-)

They're only being hurt if I can buy the original track somehow.  This is 
not usually
the case, since I don't know what it is, and usually have no way of finding 
out.  Even
if I could find out the name of the track and the label, odds are pretty 
good it is
out of print, given the small pressings that many of these records have.   
Whether
or not it appears on Garth's CD does not change this, unless the artists are 
credited on
the CD, in which case the existance of the CD changes it for the better 
(from both my
point-of-view and that of the original artist).

  OFFICE MEMO         Gathered                              Date:  2/7/94

Just a quick review of the Gathering....it seems that both of the big parties
went off this weekend, which is a good thing.  The Gathering was held in the
Richmond Civic Center, which some may call overused, but never bustable.  The
place has so much room that it never seems to get too crowded, and actually has
a second dance floor that you can dance on.

The best dj performance went to Jon Williams, followed closely, neck-ta-neck by
Tony.  Sound was brilliant, and the overall vibe was actually very friendly. 
People were actually making friends with others again.  It was a nice thing to
come back to.  The Dub Room was going off, which was frustrating--I kept
drifting between Farina and Williams to make sure I wasn't missing anything.  
Spun came on with a rather dark set for the time period, but Rick played a
wicked set that kept everyone grroooving...it was a cool party, a really fun
time.  Good ambient room with birthday boy Nick Philips, and, happily enough,
the music was actually at an ambient level, you could actually talk and
relax...

There were donations for Malachy being collected, even for those that made it
on the guest list.  

So.  good space, great music, great time.  The only weak part was the accident
that I saw right after I got into the city from the bay bridge..the heavy rain
took some people by surprise...too bad.

have a good week..!  Good to see everyone who I saw there!  The party threw me
back about a year ago...

Whether THC affects seratonin recreceptors or not I don't know

the filtering actually does remove elements of the smoke that can

Publicizing that "there's going to be a party" doesn't help.  Since you
obviously can't post the location of a break-in, no one on the list that
isn't on the grapevine will be able to go anyway, so all you're doing
is bringing heat down on yourself and other people who may or may not
condone such activities.

I am not going to bother taking a moral stand for or against -- I just
caution against feeling too secure in the "bubble effect" created by 
staring at a computer screen, similar to the thing where people in cars
feel like they're invisible to the outside and will pick their noses
in the middle of a traffic jam.  (Nothing against nose-picking; I enjoy
a tasty booger every now and then.)

If anyone here remembers the days when Thomas first stepped upon these
fertile shores, he always used to be the closer.  His first performance
was closing at the very first, underground, mappoint Gathering, and he
and Garth just blew the roof off the place.  For a while after that Thomas
was king, but gradually his reputation slipped -- I guess interpersonal
problems with certain promoters or something.  But I've always thought
of him being one of the great acid jazz DJ's.  Check out his mix tape,
sometime it's really unique, and captured him at his finest hour!

Speaking of the Gathering, it was as usual a fantastic social experience,
and the multi-projection guys did something really creative:  they devised
a screen consisting of three equilateral triangles arranged around a similar
triangle of "negative" space.  The multi-images worked really well on this
screen setup.  The vibe was there, especially in the ambient room (which
Mike Romo already gushed about  =)

The music...?  Well, Spun and Rick Preston had some fine moments, but I
can't say it was the most inspiring night for dancing (although I arrived
too late to catch Jon Williams  :(  ).  And it's kind of a shame
Martin couldn't fit it into his budget to hire a couple of people
to run a coat check on a rainy winter night...  just a matter of basic
consideration to your guests really.  I've lost three jackets at raves,
so I had to spend the whole night keeping an eye on the crannies where
I stuffed my jacket... it sort of detracts from the enjoyment of the night.

But it's good to hear Jeno and Garth are back on track -- they impressed
me more at the last FMR than I can remember in a long time!

Anyway, it's a birthday party with lots of DJs - Aaron O, Dutch,
Ghost, Harry Who, XL, Jay J, Bam Bam, Kenneth Paul, Carlos, Rick
Preston and more.  It starts at 8pm and may go to 6am if they
collect enough donations.  It is a 21+ party.  The End-Up
is at 6th and Harrison in SF.

The Elmo line (415.884.ABCD) may have additional info.

Status: 

i was pumped for The Gathering - a load of good DJs, and Martin as
promoter usually guarantees a trouble-free ride.  Richmond Civic
Center isn't my favorite space, but it's reasonably close to SF and
guaranteed bust-free.

i had a lovely time.  i didn't think the crowd was all that great but
i wasn't there to meet people or be friendly... i was there to bug out
and listen to some great music, and with that in mind, here's a little
breakdown of the music that was going on:

main room -
simon: housy/funky but largely boring.  technically, he's got it, but
there was no spark.

jon williams: i didn't think he was all that brilliant actually, which
is odd, since i usually love him.  this time he was playing relatively
fast stuff that was very straight up-and-down rhythmically.  what i
tend to call "nodding music" since it seems to encourage a
head-nodding movement.  boom boom boom and not that interesting to me.
i wanted More Tweak Factor.  this was just Hard & Fast for the sake of
it.

tony: he really whipped the crowd into a frenzy.  i stood in the
middle just to savor some of the energy, even though i didn't really
care for all the songs.  he plays some of the funky stuff, which i
like, but he also plays a lot of the progressive anthem stuff, which i
don't like, since most of it is constructed in a very basic manner
with obvious build-ups and lots of "you should scream NOW" stuff built
in.  i don't like such obvious manipulation.

spun: ah, my man.  he is the master, no doubt.  heavy tweak and
electro factor - big thumbs up.  he screwed up a lot of mixes, but i
didn't care, just because i loved the music.  nobody else seems to
play this style - a shame for me since i love it, but a plus for Spun
since it means he's basically got an "exclusive" act.

i missed most of josh.  i was starting to lose it.

in the outside hall they had a smaller dance area set up.  i missed
carlos (damn!) but i did catch good portions of...

joe harp: (i'm guessing - kind of a heavy-set fellow with blondish
hair - since he's the only name i don't know by sight from the flyer,
i have to assume it was he)... very nice!  on the hip hop edge for a
while before moving into housier territory.  excellent mixing ability
and nice flow.  one to watch.

mark farina: pure chicago house.  he mixed it up between the more
straightahead song-type stuff and the weirder more technoid variety.
i (obviously) preferred the technoid stuff to the wailing divas but at
least he kept changing it around.  technically he's excellent - watch
him at work if you get a chance - he does some very nifty tricks.

rick preston: funky man!!  lots of energy, a lot of fun, and technical
proficiency... rick is severely underappreciated in this town and
that's a shame, cos he's really got a lot to offer.

the chill room was, as has been mentioned, extremely nice.  at one
point it felt like the air inside had been turned into a 70% ganja/30%
oxygen mixture which, needless to say, had some really cool effects on
people.  the music was loud enough so you could hear all the details
without being so loud that conversation was hard.  big bonus points.

the $3 figure includes the cost of the artwork (running film and
printing the booklets/cards).

vinyl is about $.75 per unit in lots of 1000.  blank sleeves are $.5 -
$.10 depending on the color.  label printing and custom printed
sleeves cost extra, of course.

BUT that didn't stop me from trying to find out more about the
party -- after all, xtctrip (or whatever his name is) DID say
it was a techno party,  and I was in the mood to perhaps risk
jail to get a dose of techno.

So I sent him email asking for more info, and was completely ignored.
Which leads me to this:  why bother telling us it's going to happen
if you're not going to help people who discreetly inquire how
to find it?  It's sort of mean -- "hi, we're having a great party

Welcome to the Acid Jazz Mailing List!  This is a form letter (sorry, but
I am a real busy person).  This list talks about a whole range of "Acid

Rebirth of Cool on 4th and B'way Records to get a good idea of our styles.
It is a very basic list; there is no FAQ as yet, no archives (except in my

now, as opposed to waiting to learn all that.

To post to the list, send mail to:

If you want off of the list, send *me* mail directly:

If you lose my address, I post often enough, you will catch my .sig

As usual, be aware of Netiquette- read a few posts first before posting. 
I don't want the first thing someone posts to be "Have you heard of
Jamiroquai?  He's brilliant!"  Also, even though this list is unmoderated,
you can get yanked off if you start to post offensive shit.  I believe in
the 1st Amendment, but I also believe in respect.  There are plenty
of other venues for offensive stuff (see rec.humour).

I listen to a wide range of music, and so does everyone else- I like
techno, house, rock and jazz.  But this is an *Acid Jazz* mailing list. 
Please no requests for techno or garage or grunge info.  :-)  If you know
of a record that people *must* hear, ......mm OK, but always
try to include the "obligatory a-jazz/related" comment (OBA-Jazz.... :-))

Also- if you belong to some organization, group, fanzine, whatever- we
*want* to hear about you, BUT- check any "ads" with me first.  Personal
recommendations are great, but I hate being surprised by sponsored ads.

Also, one last reminder.  Acid Jazz and related musics are usually about
peace and the struggle against oppression (for our brothers *and*
sisters).  In that vibe, be respectful- disagree, but don't slam people.
Flaming over the list is *not* looked upon favorably- flame personally if
you have to at all.

I hope you like the list (imagine- based in Hawaii!!!  ;-))

Peace and respect,
Greg Beuthin.

Here's what I know, or what I think I know:

The typical raver does not buy much dance music at all. Of the ones
that do, some of it comes from compilations bought at stores, and some
of it is mix tapes.

The typical raver does not buy any 12" vinyl music.

The people that make the music know it is being played at dance
parties.

The people that make the music know it is being re-released as mix
tapes.

DJs play neither mix tapes nor mix-CDs at parties.

It would be difficult to impossible to get DJs to release set lists
and pay ASCAP for music played at parties.

It would be difficult to get DJs to release set lists of music
re-released on mix tapes.

Music is already at the very limits of what DJs will pay for it (based
on talking to 3 or 4 DJs).

Using the word "steal" to refer to copyright infringement is
incorrect. Copyright infringement is not theft and cannot be
prosecuted as such, as ruled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1985.

Most raves, if they make money, make very little.

Most raves are not commercial ventures but are rather underground
events informally organized (i.e. no incorporation involved).

Nearly all raves are paid for solely by the cost of admission (and
perhaps coat checks). There are no advertising tie-ins, corporate
donations, etc.

Given all of the above, the only sensible scheme I can think of is to
have royalties included in the purchase price of original vinyl.
However, this will probably drive up the price too high.

Perhaps DJs feel that the royalties are already being paid in the high
price of the music?

Maybe saying that "If you don't like it, don't sell your music." is
cruel, but the reality of the situation is cruel. I don't believe you
can extract any more money from anyone without killing off the scene.
And the scene is the music makers' only market.

Any solution has to work within those parameters. Accusations and name
calling will only have negative results.

One interesting consequence of heavy-handed legal action could be a
record-buying strike. The market is small enough that this could
happen, though I'd hate to see the record stores thus adversely
affected.

As Geoff said, and I paraphrase, this was THE place to be on Saturday!

I was all "cracked-up" to go to 16th and Harrison (a bunch of bullshit fed
to me by somebody), and when I got the address,  I was pleasantly suprised.

Wicked chose to get back to it's fucking roots, UNDERGROUND (literally), in
a whole new space!  That immediately put me in a mood to dance, someone
took the time and effort, after all this time, to do it RIGHT!  Full on
PROPS!!!!

Got there for all the boys sets.  Heard Jeno do what he is reknown for
doing....fucking it up!  He played quite well, and filled up the floor
quckly as he put on the tunes....absolutely BRILLIANT!

Next came Markie "THE MAN" Mark.  That's really all that needs to be said
since he is at the TOP of his form.  A great acidic set, that changed to
deep, and then mutated into, oh yes, my favorite, trip-hop (and this is NO
SHIT).  The beats were on and so was everyone else.  People were going
ballistic.

By the time Markie got off the decks, my faith, absent for a year, was
renewed that the boys were back in town, and in rare form for the evening.

Next came Garth, and I was ready at that stage to give him no due.  But he
suprised me with a great set!  Once he got going he was ON!

Thomas closed, but I only got to hear the first hours of his set.
Brilliant is the word!

After not attending a Wicked for about a year now I really didn't know what
to expect crowdwise.  But I was pleasantly suprised to see a multitude of
people from all different backgrounds, and pursuasions.  This was a real
treat to me since I have felt for a long time that this "scene" had become
rather homogenous, and quite boring as a result.  There were alot of fresh
new faces, and some old skool (although not as many as I had expected).
Overall the vibe was REAL friendly as people shared water, drinks (mostly
cokes/diet coke), and smiles (something I thought vanished a while back).
People on the whole were very cool, and ready to sweat (second sweatiest
wicked ever, and there was only one SM).

They had two chill rooms, that did not turn into "petting zoos" (I really
don't like all the groping and nonesense that tends to go on in those, er,
errogenous zomes).  A nice change.  The crowd was an older crowd, but that
is to be expected at times.

For me, this party rated an A+!

Great UNUSED space.
Great CENTRAL SF locale.
Great MUSIC.
Great VIBE.
Great PEOPLE.

This mother of a party went OFF!

Pax,
John

Dans la Matrice,  Sean Casey a dit:

That may or may not be the case for San Francisco, but from the volume of
12" and cd singles of techno sold in Montreal, i would be surprised if
all these were DJs... But again, this is where there are the most music
sold in Canada...

> Of the ones

No major store will sell mix tapes and the rare tapes i've seen were mostly
authorised compilations. As for compilations, i think it is a good thing to
promote techno to have CD comps. Sure some are pretty bad, but once in a
while you get quite excellent comps (FNAC, +8 etc...)

> The typical raver does not buy any 12" vinyl music.

Probably not. Who has a turntable now? some DJs and some audiophiles.
And even them have started the conversion toward CDs.

> The people that make the music know it is being played at dance
> parties.

Yes, but at least nobody is making big buck out of the song. Still, in
theory, a private DJ (doing business as) should pay ASCAP/BMI in the US,
SOCAN in canada and PRS in the UK. (have no idea for other countries).
Same thing with radio stations, clubs etc... If it's gonna be heard by
more than a few people (i'd have to check to see the precise number),
royalties are due.

> The people that make the music know it is being re-released as mix
> tapes.

They hope they are not released on mix tapes. The only excuse for mix tapes
is for a DJ to get a djing job. And even then, they should ask permission.
I mean, come on. How hard is it to get permission?? Plus that way, you'll
be in good term with the record label, and you may be able to get some
privileges. The DJ makes money on mix tapes (dont let anybody tell you
otherwise - unless it is a promo tape to try to get gigs which is given out
or sent for the cost of the postage). He is making money out of the work
of somebody else. Sure, the DJ works to make a mix tape. But the artist
who made the song may have spent a few weeks working on his 12" or single...
So, i think it is completely fair for DJs to pay royalties.

> DJs play neither mix tapes nor mix-CDs at parties.

So?

I dont see why. It is currently done by a good bunch.

> It would be difficult to get DJs to release set lists of music
> re-released on mix tapes.

Not. Heck, they must have the original vinyls if they did the song? Where
did they buy it from? If the fax/phone or address is not written on the
record, then just ask the place where you bought it from if the label is
too small to be in the usual registries (there are even quite extensive
lists on the net).

Raves, when non commercial are in a different boat than big time DJs selling
mix tapes or getting paid 500$ or 1000$ plus trip expenses for, say, 2 hours
of work? But commercial raves however, should pay royalties. BTW, royalties
are not that expensive (unless the states are very different from Canada).
It is more a token of appreciation to the artists (and add the tokens and
it is tangible).

DJs pay mostly for distribution and retailers, not the artist.

SF Rave report
==============

  Hello all you world ravers out there....  Here is yet again,  another
rave report as seen through MY eyes,  ears and sensory organs...

Come/Unity - Wednesday

  As usual,   it was BIG,  dispite the fact that it was mid-week.   Was
held at 1015 Folsom St space (One of my FAVORITE).   As usual,  it was
totally awsome.    I would estimate about 300 - 400 people jammed into 
this space,   and as usual,   I went totally insane,  and let the music
bash me around the dance floor as I let the music take total control.
Come/Unity raves are similar to the Wicked variaty,   and dispite the
fact that it was the middle of the week,   a huge amount of people attended,
dispite the fact that most had to work the next day,  but to a dedicated
raver,  sleep is something that can be put off.

SpaceLab - Thursday

  Unfortunately,  this is the LAST spacelab,   BUMMER!!  I really enjoyed
the Hardcore Techno and the faster beats that pumped out of the speakers.
It is most unfortunate that SpaceLab lacked attendance,  but was the reason
why it had to die.    Alex,  from Gaela Montra record store really cooked
and kept me sizzling around the dancefloor like there was no end.   Earlier,
when I got there,   the DJ (Don't recall his name) really didn't have it
together in the "Beat match" department.   Alex and Jonah were really GREAT!!
and I hope to hear them in upcoming events.

DubTribe Birthday party - Friday Evening

  Simon and John Howard really pumped out some wondeful housey sounds that
were totally funkey and amazing.    It was located at the DV8 lounge on the
3rd floor,   and the main dance area,  although rather small,  didn't provide
much dancing room (Almost as crowded as the EndUp at times).   The Chill out
room was really cool,  and very well done.    There was,  however,  a lack of
enough pillows and mattresses for all to use,   but it was fairly large,  had
a seperate bar,   and the temperature was really cool,  which is what a
chillout room should have.    

  Eventually,  DubTribe went on live,  and pumped out some wonderful creative
sets which really surprised me how well they came off.    Their vocal parts
were really great.    

  Although we were told that it was to end at 5 am,   the music stopped at
4:30.    Yukk!!  And I never even got a chance to dance the last set,  as
I was chilling in the other room expecting to just get out there and cook
for the last half hour.    Oh well!!  - And I was so pumped up...   so,
we went home to Mill Valley and tried to sleep.    My friend managed to
get some sleep,   but I just sat up,  staying awake,  working on some
crazy insane ideas I had.

The Gathering - Saturday evening

  Before the Gathering,   I spent a lot of time doing my exercises,  getting
ready to let loose with as much continious energy as I could muster up,  in
anticipation for the Gathering.    Had a wonderful time,  playing frisbee
in this totally awsome redwood forest in Mill Valley before heading over
to the Coffee Roastery,  and getting caffened up.    Lo and behold,  I meet
yet more raver friends at the Roastery,  and met my next door neighbor for
the 2nd time.    I remember meeting him at Funkey Techno Tribe rave last
summer.   We all head back to Eagle Cliff (Where I live),  which is an old
hunting lodge nestled up in the redwoods,  in the hills behind town.

  In the evening,   some people from the Netherlands dropped by to meet 
us here in Mill Valley,  so we partied a tad before heading out.   

  After calling the info line,  we confirm the location this time was to be
at the Richmond Civic Center,  a very large multi-purpose auditorium like
space.    There were 2 dance areas set aside,   one in the main auditoruim
area,   and the other next to the main entrance,  but wasn't used for that.

  Aaron,  my friend told me that Carlos was spinning in the main entrance
area,  so I headed out to hear him.   At that time,  Simon was spinning
a really deep house set that had me in it's total control.    As usual,
Carlos was going insane with his trademark scratching,   and mixing in
some special "subBeats" to the main somg playing.   He is one of the very
few DJ's that actually dances behind the turn tables,  and is totally
fun to watch,  as large crowds of people gather around to watch him spin.

  The Chillout area,  although was small,   was fairly hot,  so I stayed
away from it,   until I could cool down to the point where I wouldn't be
cooking.   I did find that the back stage area behind the turn tables was
the best place to chill.    Nobody discovered it,   and I had the whole place 
to myself so I could do my exercises after dancing long sets.   As usual,
it was crowded,   as I would estimate somewhere between 1500 to 2000 people
showed up.

  Jon Williams and Spun really did some brilliant work behind the turn tables
and Doran was also brilliant.   I heard some new songs for the first time,
and it was really refreshing to hear new stuff,  especially the acid house
stuff.   All were keeping the beat going constantly,  and it was really hard
to break away from the dance floor aftrer dancing for several hours continiously
non-stop.    It was my 2nd evening wihout sleep,   but I hardly noticed any
energy drain that evening,   and went around the dance floor generating as
many smiles as possible.   I noticed that earlier on,  some lights made it
easy to see where I was going,  but later,   the lights were shut off,  and
it was totally dark in the main area,   but when the strobe came on,   WOW!
what strange visual effects.  Martin O'Brian promoted the event,  in cooperation
with Preston of Toon Town fame and also Boogie Buffet.   As usual,  it was
put together very well,  and towards the end,   the DJ faded out the sound,
and all was quiet.    Everyone just stood around,   then one more song was
played (Typical Martin's special touch).    I really like it when I know
it's the last song because I really want to dance my butt off.    The lights
came on during the last song,  making it easier to locate friends,   and
I went totally insane during the last song,   trying to drain every bit of
my energy out,   but the song just ended all too soon.    Everyone was standing
around in a daze,  totally zoned out.   Then I said Hi to all my SFRaver
friends,  and we parted in the down pouring rain. 

   We manage to stop by a Dennnies in Emeryville before heading back into
SF,  and dropped our friends home,  then headed over to the DNA.    It was
really nice to chill out at the DNA,  as they got a really GREAT chill room.
It was really wonderful for me to stretch out,  do yoga,  expecially after
dancing my butt off at the Gathering.

   Afterwards,  I sent out there again to dance,  after feeling much better,
and got totally entranced with the great housey funkey tunes,  thinking about
my crazy ideas,  and losing touch with reality....

   After the DNA closed at 3 pm,  we headed over to the EndUp,  which was
very crowded due to the constant rain.    Dance floor was really wet and
slippery,  crowded,   but I mamaged to enjoy myself,  meeting the usual
friends that frequent the place.     BOY!  I can't wait till Boogie Buffet
opens up again in March.

   While at the DNA,  I got reports that Wicked (Also happening on Sat
evening) was HOT and Wicked.    I hope those people that posted the Wicked
reviews would also post to alt.rave

   All in all,  after attending yet another batch of 4 raves in a row,  I
had a womderful raving weekend that started last Wednesday,  and even managed
to get about 3 hours of sleep from Wednesday evening until Sunday evening.
I wanted to make it to Spundae this time,   but because of the relentless
rain,   and lack of money,  I decided to pospone it till next week.

Till Next time...   RAVE ON - And keep the scene alive...

[Re: Francois' contradiction of my observations.]

I don't mean to be rude, but his post in reply to mine contained just
about zero useful information. He simply contradicted me sentence by
sentence, and pretty much lost the whole context of the thing which is
given the limitations how does one extract more money from the scene
without shutting down the market.

How are DJs to obtain permission to release a mixed set? There are
probably over 20-30 songs on as many small labels in a set. That's a
monumental amount of work for a tape which will sell 50-100 copies.
They just won't do it. When I said "difficult to get DJs to do it", I
wasn't saying "it's difficult for DJs to do it" (which it is). Any
solution has to be practical for DJs, and all he suggested is
something that DJs just simply won't do.

And saying things like "the only excuse for" and "they should" is
still just focusing on the negative. He can say it all he wants, but
it won't help, and if one tries to enforce it legally, it won't help
either the DJs or the music makers.

Except for my comments at the bottom, I was only reporting what I see.
Refuting it line by line is pointless and merely inflammatory. Calling
me a liar? "Did so." "Did not?" What's the point? Well? Anyone who is
pro-music-artist want to suggest something practical that people will
actually do?

The painted floors had been damaged by the moisture.  There should have
been some space setup for smokers.  As crowded and hard-to-breathe it was,
we didn't need smokers secretly puffing away right next to you while trying
to dance.

With the exception that 4 friends were mugged at gun-point a few

You've probably already heard/read about how great the Gathering was, so I'll 
save the bandwidth and resist writing anything about the actual rave.

On the drive home, though, my roommates and I listened to our fave new CD:
"Strange Cargo III" by William Orbit, the perfect album to listen to during
a half-hour drive on a rainy Sunday morning.  The songs are beautifully
melodic and swim in a very ethereal ambience.  The whole CD is just dripping
with excellent production.  If you like the Future Sound of London or Orbital,
you will probably like this CD.  And it's domestic, too.  (This $13 CD is
better than most of the imports I've bought lately.)

	I definately  agree with you.  I'm sure there are Dj's willing to 
do it for free if we throw a party.  And some of the money we get could 
pay for the sound system and all the rest could go to a cause that we can 
agree on.  I'll be back in california during the summer and am willing to 
help out.  I hope everybody does the same.

Subject: A GWT Weekend
Status: 


 A Gathering/Wicked/Techno Weekend -

 Having been in a rave drought for quite a few weeks , I was ready to do
some serious dancing . [ I've been distracted from raving by work and
my inpending marriage - Mary and I got married at a drive-up window
ceremony in Las Vegas on Jan. 7th! ].

 So, being that the GATHERING and WICKED were going to be on at the same 
evening , I decided to go to both! And afterwards , I'd make an excursion
to the techno music stores in S.F. and Berkeley.

 I got to the Gathering at about 12:45 AM - everything was as people have alr
already descibed it in other postings. I have a few more grips about it
than other folks , but I still had a good time!

 * No coat check - this meant I had to lug my bag around , and with no
   ins or outs , there was no way to get back to my truck to drop it off.
   Also , it meant much more bags on the dancefloor , making for an 
   obstical course effect. 
    Also , having a bag on the floor meant I had to dance near it - which
   cuts into my dancing style. I like to roam around the dance floor ,
   even jog/run occasionally ; this is more bothersome with a backpack
   than without.

 * Not enough sound isolation between ambient room and main floor { but
   that's always been a problem with using that room. Maybe if they had
   used a room located between that location and the back dance area }.
   That means the volume has to be cranked up above what I think
   "ambient" levels should be , and there was still too much bass leakage
   for my taste. 

 Thanks to Capt. Crunch for showing me some back exercises in the ambient
room. It was also good to see some other folks as well - Bryce , 
Phil , Allen , and others.

 This new beard I'm working on must make me look more authoritive - I had
about 3 or 4 people come up to me and ask questions about where things
were ( or maybe , it makes me look more janitorial :-(  ).

 From a real-easy-to-find GATHERING to a take-you-chances map point 
WICKED : Another great event , limited only by my fatigue. After checking
out the neighborhood and finding a close place to park , I managed to 
avoid any muggers and knocked on the door. The doorman was Geoff White!
I took this to be a good omen. As I entered , my glasses immediatley 
fogged up! I amost slipped on the wet sloping floor on my way to the
ticket table. When I passed the large chill area and entered the dance
floor , my glasses fogged up AGAIN as the humidity wrapped itself around
me. 

 Good music , and a good vibe. As I remember , I saw Raphael there , and
John S. Lee . 

 I'm amazed that the owners of the space have let it be used before -
I can only imagine what the place must have looked & smelled like Sunday.
I bet they were among the folks doing the dancing!

 * There has GOT to be a way to get cool air INTO a closed space like the
   WICKED site , without 100+ decibel music getting OUT. If that method
   was portable , so much the better. Having a rave in spaces that aren't
   meant to ventilate large aerobicizing crowds is chummy for awhile , but
   I suspect the warm clamminess wears people out faster , also increases
   the chance of overheating.  

 
 -------

 After WICKED , I got the Sunday paper and had breakfast at I-HOP in 
North Beach. Upon compleating my German crepes , I drove to the E
Exploratorium's parking lot for a few hours snooze in my truck , with the
pit-pat of rain as a lullaby.

 When I awoke, I drove to the Haight/Fillmore area , to check out Tweekin'
Records. I nice store , with turntables and headphones for customers to
use to check out the vinyl prior to purchase. 

 Afterwards , I tried to get to BPM , but the gods of S.F. parking decreed
that Sunday was not my day to visit BPM , so I drove to Gaia Mantra on 
Valencia instead. Despite my phone call on Saturday to make sure that 
they were open on Sundays , they were not open THIS Sunday , so I
struck out there too. 

 So , on to Berkeley. The first store I stopped of at was Mod Lang , on
University Ave. ,  above the Shattuck Ave. intersection(s) , next to
Comic Relief. Nice selection - got an Exist Dance compilation CD ;I bought 
the Trance Europe Express multi-lp package for a lower price than what
Tweekin' wanted. However , Mod Lang had no preview turntables set up ,
although I didn't ask if they did in-store previews for customers.

 My last visit was to Amoeba on Telegraph - what a monster store! I was 
pretty much pooped out by then , so I just gave their bins a cursory
glance over. I must check them out later.

 ------

 Finally got home by 6:30PM , and glad to be home too , after driving 
around all night and day in the rain. I can't wait until I'm free to
rave again!

Well, i at least indicated that honest DJs did ask for permission and
pay royalties if the artist ask for some (which is not always the case)
when they are making good money out of the operation, not really
promoting the scene. I think a line has to be drawn somewhere of course
and i'm not asking small raves to pay royalties and giving the credits
to the records. But mix tapes are totally different. Now, either this
will self regulate, or i'm sure artists will get fed up and they will
use the copyright law to protect their rights. 20 copies is not a concern,
but when i see that some DJs put out 1000 mix cds (and on labels such
as hype or quality 10000 is not uncommon) then i definitely see an abuse.

> given the limitations how does one extract more money from the scene
> without shutting down the market.

You know how much money big DJs do, so it is only fair that they be fair
and at least give the name of the songs and artists. Most artists will be
happy to be in a mix tape and probably wont ask for royalties as long as
information on the track is present.

The first mix tape or two may be a bit longer to do but after that, not
only you will have a good database of labels, but labels will come to you
and say "you can use this and that if you want". I'm putting presently
a demo for a radio station and i'm currently contacting the artists. My
guess is that in all i'll have lost about 4 hours. 

> They just won't do it. When I said "difficult to get DJs to do it", I

With the exception of white labels that even the store dont know how to contact
the artist even thru the distributor, getting an approval is usually
straightforward. A fax machine will help save a lot of time of course.

> Any

I just suggested what is being done here. You dont like it, well what
can i say? I think it's time the rave scene gets rid of people who want
to make a fast buck (some promoters, some people selling clothes, smart
drinks, mix tapes etc...).

Being a DJ, bands manager, music maker, raver and software publisher and
using other people work and other people using my work, i've looked at
this quite extensively and i think it's only fair to everybody if
everybody go by the rules. I am pretty confident that it will self
regulate in the next 2 years if the software industry is a valid
comparison.

Status: 

Consumer alert: Extremely long posting follows!

I've been thinking quite a bit about the issues being discussed here
recently.  Here is a somewhat disjointed commentary based on my last
six months getting geared up onna DJ tip and visiting record stores
coast to coast . . .

What you say about the way the circulation of underground vinyl works
is true, Sean, but in the larger sense, this is only a small part of
the current dance vinyl market, most of which goes toward the club side
(disco, house, garage, rare groove, hip hop, rap).  The music biz hustle
definitely exists in that context, the fans do buy records as well as
the DJs.  In the UK and the Continent, the dance music market is probably
1.5 orders of magnitude larger than here.  Tracks we consider fairly
rare often show up on top-ten DJ lists I see in the mainstream slick mags
like DJ and Mixmag.  Those prized white labels turn out, more often than
not, to be promo copies of those same top-selling tracks (my white label
copy of the first 'Nush' was the first to clue me in to that).

There are also distribution mechanisms us regular folx never see -- the
record pools, remix services, promos and very-limited-pressing insider
discs.  (Although I have to say my limited experience with such things
indicates that quality is just as uneven as in the record bins at the
local DJ emporium.)

However, all of this is definitively NOT business as usual.  The advent
of first cassettes and, now, especially, low-cost high-quality digital
recording equipment is radically and forever changing the rules of the
game in the music business.  For the first time since Edison started
pressing wax, musicians have a shot at reaching audiences and get a
reasonable economic return without having to squirm through the A&R
(artist & repertoire) knothole, which is the consequence of the fact
that vinyl pressing plants and national distribution require mega-million
buck companies, who then make money hand over fist off a gullible public,
quasi-monopolistic market practices, and forcing musicians and producers
into various flavors of indentured servitude.  

The consequences of desktop recording on all of this are cataclysmic.
The big companies are really no longer needed.  The vertical monopolies
they build in order to produce enormous returns for themselves and 
riches for a very limited number of musicians were dependent on the 
extremely high hurdle rate for anyone else to get into the business.
How many major new record labels were started in the last 20 yeras
(not counting split-offs by industry execs)?  Virtually none.  The
motion was all in the opposite direction, with constant megamergers
by the big companies and swallowing the smaller labels whole.

That started a small counter-revolution with the revival of small
speciality labels in the 1980s to promote indie rock and other splinter
scenes.  And in the non-US/UK/EC world, vinyl was rapidly supplanted by
cassettes and rampant piracy since the First World music oligopoly priced
itself out of Second and Third World markets for all but the most popular
stuff.

Cassettes struck the blow against the vinyl empire, and CDs are supplanting
them both, in the mega-record company effort to maintain control.  But the
consequence is a fully-amortized vinyl production industry which *will*
take small orders and charge under a buck a unit, which was definitely not
the case a decade ago.  And cassettes are a cheap, ubiquitous and decently
high-quality method of production and distribution with universally 
available hardware on the consumer end -- at home *and* in the car.
So the new is bubbling up from the ashes of the empire's old abandoned
technology, and digital desktop production is rapidly making record
company monopoly on high-quality production facilities a thing of the
past.  They will continue to be a dominant but not suffocating force,
as a result, and turn more into distribution than production companies
(as indeed they already have been doing for nearly a generation -- my
favorite examples of this are how Sire and IRS have fared as labels
with major record company control/deals).

The majors will try and dovetail their efforts with the other media
deals being done (to the extent they're not already deeply involved).
You better believe the 'information supertollroad' will be carrying
major label product direct to your TV/multi device -- hey, DMX is
already doing it (though they haven't got the 'on demand' part down
yet).  

But for people doing innovative music, and audiences looking for it,
things are looking up.  It's much better even as bad as it is now,
compared to, say, 1979 when I was writing about the biz and reviewing
indie and major label releases, or 1973 when I first got into this game
as a college radio DJ and concert producer.

While A&R still plays a role even in the dance music world (where the club
scene is by far the dominant economic factor compared to our underground
scene), what is happening in the underground life cycle of dance/trance/
ambient music is extremely significant because the links between musicians
and audiences are shortening in number, time and cost.  DJs function much
more in the A&R role, in fact, than in the old push-the-hot-trax-whore
mode.  In an evolutionary sense, think of it as an extremely adaptive
simulation system with significant feedback loops between producers and
consumers.  This leads to very rapid evolution in audience music taste,
which drives musicians and producers towards the innovative tip (while
still keeping an eye out for the tracks that pay da rent).  In our scene,
the total units of vinyl or CDs or cassettes or whatever is not out of 
line for the number of people involved (given a somewhat higher rate
of economic preference for music expenditures), but the formula 
unique tracks * units * average market lifetime = total output/demand
significantly changes: the number of individual tracks has gone way
up, the number of units produced on average has gone down (because of 
the changing economics of vinyl, cassettes and desktop/small studio
production), and average track time availability is drastically reduced.
I can't even find top-ten tracks from *three* months ago in many cases.
The changing economics of the industry has moved us far in the direction
where the rate of change in the kind and variety of dance music being
produced is fast approaching the maximum net innovation rate of musicians
and the maximum net innovation demand of consumers.

I don't know if this kind of careening ever faster down the track is
going to sustain at this level for the foreseeable future, but it sure
looks like it. 

In a previous comment, someone mentioned that DJs have to screen hundreds
of tracks to find what they want to play.  That was an underestimate.
In a typical two-hour record store session, I've been screening 100 to
150 discs and as many as 300 tracks *per visit*, and running into very
little duplication across record stores (and I've visited a lot since
September).  The median stock turnover (the point at which half the
tracks are new since my last visit, setting aside archival collections
like the back racks at BPM and Star) is around 60 days now, and may
still be declining.  These are indications of a music industry, in our
event of it, in revolutionary upheaval.

A small label can produce and distribute a few hundred copies of a couple
tracks for well under $1,000 (assuming they do a fair bit of business
and have the advantage of volume buying over time).  That was unheard of
even ten years ago, when both the music production and unit production
costs were much higher.  Thus, the flood of releases.  Also, the relative
lack of quality.  I'm pretty picky, and I don't buy everything I like,
and some genres I don't touch, but I wouldn't be surprised if my roughly
3% buy/audition rate for vinyl is fairly typical for DJs.  I have about
100 discs in my 'crate' right now, and based on a 3% rate that means
I've listened to over *3000* disks in the store (not to mentioned countless
more at parties and on tapes and CDs).  Yet I recognize less than 20% of
the stuff reviewed in the DJ mags.  It's a surfeit of riches for the
diligent -- and the quick.  It wouldn't surprise me if something like
25,000 different recordings of dance/ambient/trance were released in
the last year (*not* counting alternate mixes, another major feature
of this scene).  95% of them are unavailable now. 

This reminds me a lot of my early BBS days, when I combed through a lot
of mediocre and even bad shareware software to find a few good ones
(including the one, Qmodem, I'm using to hook into the net and type
this message with).  Let ten thousand flowers bloom :)

I don't want to draw any strong analogies with the growth of the consumer
software market, because I don't see any.  It's just the feeling that
the doors are open and opportunities abound that I find so familiar.
It's what brought me back 'inside' the music game 12 years after I thought
I'd walked away from it forever.

Status: 

Yeah, I know everyone's sick of this thread, but here I go...

To me, music like good useful information, is a form of knowledge, and 
should be made available to as many people in as many ways as possible.  
Bootlegging, sampling, copying, remixing, etc. should be encouraged without 
limits, without royalties.  We need more distribution channels and less 
restrictions.  I am happy to see DJs and the producers of CD boots make 
money performing a vital service, which is to get the music to the people.  
I'd also like to see as much infomation about the music as possible;  who 
made it, sample sources, instruments used - anything that gives me more 
insight into the art and aids me in finding more of it.  Giving proper 
credit is desireable, because it represents true, useful information, but 
has nothing to do with money.

There is more good music being produced than we can even imagine by people 
who will do it whether they get paid or not.  When someone creates a work 
of art/music, they have done *nothing* for society and do not deserve to be 
paid.  It is only when it reaches the audience that a service has been 
performed.  

I feel that same way about software.  I write code and manage programmers,
and the rule of thumb is that whenever possible, good code should be reused.  
And you know what?  There are loads of really good programmers who would 
rather write their own code from scratch.  Creative people want to create - 
it has little to do with money.  Madonna is rich mostly because of her 
marketing capabilities, not her abilities as an artist.  If you want to make 
money in music, then get involved in marketing and distribution - *that* is 
where the link to the paying public exists.

I've been making music for a long time - I'm an original 808 & 303 owner 
and was making techno and acid trance long before the terms existed.  It 
didn't matter to me that there was no market for it.  I loved what I was 
doing.  When I finally got paid, sure I was happy to take the money; it was 
for doing the soundtracks for three porno movies.  But what really mattered 
was just getting distributed, having someone find me an audience; The 
feeling you get when you know that thousands of guys all over the country 
are jerking off to your creation is hard to describe, but it's priceless.

The 3 movies, available on video are _The Story of Prunella_, _Forgive Me 
For I Have Sinned_, and _Johnny Boy Blew_.  Get them for the music and
please feel free to sample, remix, or release it on CD.

You've probably already heard/read about how great the Gathering was, so I'll 
save the bandwidth and resist writing anything about the actual rave.

On the drive home, though, my roommates and I listened to our fave new CD:
"Strange Cargo III" by William Orbit, the perfect album to listen to during
a half-hour drive on a rainy Sunday morning.  The songs are beautifully
melodic and swim in a very ethereal ambience.  The whole CD is just dripping
with excellent production.  If you like the Future Sound of London or Orbital,
you will probably like this CD.  And it's domestic, too.  (This $13 CD is
better than most of the imports I've bought lately.)

It seems that these two statements are incompatible with each other. If
an artist creates 'good useful information' and 'a form of knowledge'
they certainly HAVE done something for society.

You seem to be saying, throughout your post, that you don't believe
musical artists should get ANY money for their work. I won't say that
without financial reward nobody would create music. You are correct
in pointing out that lots of people make music without thought of
profit. But if the artists don't make ANY money how are they supposed
to pay for musical instruments? Won't the fact that they'll all have
to have full time careers 'on the side' cut into their creative
endeavors just a bit? Other artists are paid, why should musicians
be somehow different? A painter hopes to be paid for their art so
that they have the ability to devote more or all of their time to
further developing their art, instead of waiting tables six hours
a day. I have to think that a musician might well benefit in the
same way. Besides, musicians have always been paid, going back to the
wandering minstrels who were treated to dinner and lodging in exchange
for their songs. 

I agree that current copyright laws and fees are a drag, and that
often groups like ASCAP seem to be doing more harm than good. But
I can't agree that a musician has no right to be rewarded for their
work.

Whether THC affects seratonin recreceptors or not I don't know
offhand, however there are more psychoactive compounds in MJ smoke
than just THC. A recent MAPS newsletter talks about a study of
bong-filtered vs non-filtered MJ smoke, and reaches a conclusion that
the filtering actually does remove elements of the smoke that can
cause negative effects such as drowsiness.

Not only that but I tried pure THC once a long time ago (synthesized with ether 
somehow by some Berkeley chemistry grad students I knew) and it's not the same
high.  It was more clear-headed and not as strong.  Kinda like smoking a fatty

Subject: music is NOT free
Status: 


ever heard of a musician who spent all of their time and resources
trying to make good music and wound up poor and/or used by the
record companies and never received a penny?

if you spend all of your time and resources making creative works
which make people happy you have a damn good reason to expect that they
exchange some units of effort (money) in return.

just because its art doesn't mean that its not hard work. a society has
many different things that make it good and those which demand hard
work should indeed be rewarded.

making quality music and distributing it are not easy and for most
people not cheap given that they want nice packaging and distribution.

where does the money come from to pay for the production?
the instruments? food? rent?

also there is quite a bit of specialization in art. not everyone
is/is able to be/or wants to be a professional artist. therefore
those who specialize should receive a return for satisfying the demand
for their creations.

it would be ideal that we could all work for only 2 hours per day
and have the rest as free time for making art but that aint the case.
there is far too much to get done- as chosen by our society- for people
to only work 2 hours per day.

anarchy sounds good to me until someone has to fix the sewers.

Only if society gets to hear it.

No.  What I'm saying is that the distributers of the music play an
equally important role in the whole process.  And since there are
not enough distribution channels and more than enough artists,
alternative distributers like DJs, bootleggers, sampler-techs,
remix engineers, etc. should be encouraged to spread the music  without
any restrictions beyond the truthful delivery of the product.

Of course I'd like to see musicians make money.  I wish everyone who
wanted to make music could be given the time and money to do so.  It's a
complicated issue, and in the context of this thread, one that is
secondary to the need for more means of distribution.

Hi!  I'm a first-year student at Berkeley, and my friend Sameer Parekh goes
to a
lot of raves.  He keeps telling me how fun they are, but somehow things
never work out that I go to one with him.  I'm from Alabama, and never
been to a rave, but I'd like to.  I also don't want to try going by
myself, either.  Any friends of his out there (thus ensuring that they're
good people 8-) ) who'd like to give me a ride?  I'm over on leri and
aleph, also.  Thanks!

	The thing that most of you don't really understand is that most DJs
aren't out there to make money off of "the scene" as we know it. 
There are only a few that are big enough or well known enough to make
a living out of it.  Most of us DJs are normal everyday people that
work a full-time job to make a living, and DJ once or twice a week
because it's something we love to do.  Every cent of money that I get
out of DJing goes back into buying new music and equipment, and I
usually end up spending a lot more out of my full-time job's paycheck
on music as well.  You can't expect people that go to a club or go to
a rave to go out and spend 10 bux a pop to buy new import vinyl.  You
can't really expect most people at a rave to even know or care who
the artist is that made the song that's playing at the moment.  Most
people simply know whether they like the music that's playing, or
not.

> music for the Scene, their primary mission is to make music that is
> HEARD and DANCED to internationally,  this Scene is NOT about 
> ASCAP, BMI, IRS, SSN ,FTB, Liquior Board or any other money  

	This I agree with.  I don't think the artists out there expect to
have every raver at a party go out and buy their single and
immediately sell 10,000 copies of their new hit song.  That's why
they press only 1,000 copies or so for DJ use.  Most musicians and
record companies have figured out by now that producing dance music
is not a way to get rich quick.  If you want to do that, go produce
the new Janet Jackson album or something.  People that produce dance
music are (for the most part) doing it so that people around the
world can enjoy it and have a great time dancing to it.  If they were
concerned about profits, they would be in some other line of
business.  If DJs keep putting the money they make for parties back
into new music, then the scene will stay alive and we will continue
to have great dance music.  Mix tapes can only help musicians in the
long run, because when a DJ sends out a mix tape, they get their name
spread a little farther, and become a little more well known.  This
means that they'll be hired for more parties, and get paid more money
which they can put back into buying more new music.  With the amount
of new music being released constantly, if you want to be able to
always play the newest stuff, you have to put all your money back
into it as a DJ.  BTW, I don't believe Garth made a cent off of his
CD.  I think some people offered to do it for him, and he let them
make it just to get his stuff heard in more places.

Status: 

Greetings!

I apologize for taking such a long time to get back to the list proper
concerning the Request For Comment I put out some time back concerning
a pre-party on the 19th.  I've been accepting responses for some time,
and doing a bit of behind the scenes work.

To date, I have received a substantial number of positive responses to
my proposal, with a few maybes and two no's.  Consequently, I've been 
working on acquiring a space for our use, and talking with folks to try
to find a consensus on the best features they would like to experience.

We have a space! Actually, i've talked with four members of sfraves 
concerning their houses, all of whom have volunteered their homes for
parties!  Wow! Hey, everone! that's great news! it's really wonderful
to see so many people opening up their homes to us all. so, we definitely
have a space to hold us all (well, maybe not if *everyone* and 5 friends
comes and stays through, but, there's lots of space in each of these homes).

A number of people have already volunteered to DJ.  I've been considering
putting up two sound systems so that everyone who wants to spin can.  I'm
very close to securing those two sound systems.  I would like to know more
about people who have sound reinforcement equipment, though.  So, you folks
with PA speakers, amps, equalizers, crossovers, etc. who i haven't talked
to, please send me some mail.

Also, i personally really enjoyed the "open-deck" quality of Friends and
Family, and want to continue in that tradition.  So, any of you folks who
want to spin, please let me know so that i can help coordinate efforts.
Don't be afraid to show up with discs... i love listening to DJs, and i'm
sure we all want to hear you.  

Also, if someone could bring a pair of CD decks, that would be wonderful
(for our CD spinning friends).

I have spoken with two people about performing live!  more! more! one
person i'm speaking with is considering ambient music in which the
"audience" gets instruments to play in the performance!

one party aspect i'm very light in (chuckle) is lighting.  any lighting
mavens out there who can give us a hand?

i have invitations/reminders available.  if you'd like one for yourself or
for your friends, please let me know.

i would like to get an estimate of the number of people who will be
attending so that we can choose the right sized space for this party.
Please email me privately if you will be coming, along with an idea
of how many others will be with you.  rough estimates only,
i just want to be sure we have a comfortable space for people.  not too 
large, not too small.

Thanks for your attention to this rather lengthy message.  I hope to see

Subject: Mother Earth Sound System is back!
Status: 


Hi folks!

I'm pleased to tell you that the Mother Earth Sound System is waking up 
from its winter hibernation, and preparing to come out into the spring 
air of 1994 with a revived sense of energy, committment, and hopefulness for 
the coming year!

Ok, what I'm about to write will probably be long, but it is the result of
a lot of talking the members of our sound system have done over the past
months, and represents our more or less collective psyche, where our heads
are at regarding the "rave scene" around here.  At the end is the dope on
our upcoming parties, so skip there if you'd like, but at some point
please check out this section in between, it is meant to make our position
on a few things more clear, to suggest some ideas, and hopefully to
generate some debate (positive, of course).

Over the past few months, it seems like the number of large parties has
dropped in favor of smaller, cheaper, more intimate events, a trend which
suits us just fine.  We prefer the higher degree of focused energy and
experimentation that can be achieved at a smaller party over the massives,
and we have enjoyed this sense of tight-knit family and freedom at our
past events mostly due to our less-than-aggressive promoting style.  This
year we plan on reaching a larger audience, one that we feel has been
ready for our sort of party for a long time.  This doesn't mean you'll be
seeing stacks of 4-color die-cuts from us lying around half the shops on
Haight, but we will be looking to expand our family, and to seek out
different talents to help us create the magic (hint: if you or someone you
know is a live musician, drummer, or some other type of artist, get in touch
with us!). 

Over the last year or so, even the last 6 months, most of us have heard
arguments that the "rave scene" in the Bay Area was too commercial,
lacking energy and community, boring, elitist, or just plain dead.  On the
other hand, many people seemed content with the scene around here,
claiming it to be much superior to LA, to the East Coast, or whereever,
based on musical tastes, BPMs, drug use, etc etc.  We've grown accustomed,
perhaps even comfortable with the cries for "change," for "keeping it
alive," for "community," or whatever typical rave slogans you like best,
and yet we haven't done a whole lot as a group of rave-goers, party
people, as a community, to make these slogans into something more than a
cool sentiment to put on a flyer for yet another massive.  "Change" from
what, to what?  Keep _what_ "alive"?  

I believe one of the strengths of the rave "scene" is that it has no
explicit dogmas or definitions, save perhaps for the need for mutual
respect and exchange of ideas and talents, to better ourselves as
individuals and hopefully our surroundings.  Since these conditions aren't
exactly commonplace, attaining them requires movement of some sort, away
from established ways of relating to one another and our environment, and 
towards some ideals that we haven't _really_ bothered to define yet.  And
at some point we WILL be forced to define ourselves and our motives, if
not from without then from within, and I think that is already what is
happening in our very own Bay Area "rave scene."  Are we to be a "scene,"
with acceptance and standards based around popular music, fashion(just
what _is_ "rave gear," anyway?), or are we to move, somewhere, anywhere
but this revolving cycle of predictable parties with predictable DJs,
music, fashion, etc? 

The Mother Earth Sound System seeks to retain that looseness of structure
that characterized the earliest gatherings (before they became "raves"),
that "anything goes" atmosphere, while at the same time promoting certain
more identifiable ideals...for example, respect and care for the
environment we live in (hence our name), respect and community-building
amongst ourselves as individuals, the exchange of information and ideas
(this is one of the primary aims of our zine), providing a conducive
surrounding to stimulate spiritual growth, and supporting specific
political/social causes or movements.  To this last end, we are planning
an indoor event to benefit the California Hemp Initiative for sometime in
March.  If you can help us with this effort in any way (especially with
locating a reliable indoor site for 2-300 people, and getting security and
sound for cheap), please get in touch with us (ph. #s below), and if
nothing else, inform yourself and your friends/co-workers/etc. of this
initiative. 

Well, my Diatribe Generator is sputtering, so I'll get to the party info:

A little elf told me that YSH is negotiating spaces, and there's a
good chance of a "We're Back" party in March :). Some people have
feared that YSH has gone away, but that is *definitely* not the case.
YSH has some new blood and a lot of enthusiasm, and they are
definitely positively going to throw some rockin' parties this year.

So keep your eyes and ears open and your dancin booties shined...

hmm.. after the ad for The PLeasure Dome 94 in Washigton DC (big event
with Dave Angel and Colin Favor and more !!!!) The Source (hmmm... must
say Robert Leiner, coz The Source = 1 dude) will bring knowledge
to sf. cool!
I seen it once in live and i have several of his tunes.... all i could
say is i think his one of the top techno/trance composer in this
planet!! His music is very 'construct' with a LOAD of 303 sounds in
it. One of the best live i ever seen (with arpeggiators).

I think I'm missing a few events because I haven't been out to pick up
flyers recently, so if anyone knows about anything on Friday, post the
info!  Tonight, This Old House could be a fun retro kinda thing if
they do it right, and the new moon party is starting to get rolling
with another outdoor party, and Roger S will be at Lift.  On Saturday,
Sharon returns.  For those of you who don't know, the Sharon parties
were some of the earliest big "raves", and later fell into disrepute,
due to perceived commercialism, broken promises, and other funny
business.  Anyway, it'll be interesting to see what happens (but not
really $20 interesting).  Finally, Sunday's Zuvuya lineup looks pretty
cool, and don't forget the weeklies!

Status: 

This is an article about Your Sister's House that I just turned out that
I am submitting to Together, UCLA's feminist newsmagazine. I just wanted
to offer it up to you for constructive criticism and/or comments...


"We are not interested in alienating that which is male; we are
interested in creating an opening for more women to become
self-expressed and to achieve their visions.  In order to genuinely
come together, we must acknowledge each other's power.  Perhaps what
once was damaged in the silencing of women will flourish again as we
all (men and women) reclaim our female power; a power to access
ancient wisdom, compassion, the connectedness of all things, our
intuitive cellular knowledge of the universe."
                                                          
--Your Sister's Rant

	Feminism always seemed like a derogatory term to me.
Feminism.  Male-bashing.  Militancy.  Hairy legs.  The convenience of
putting the term into an easy to manage, stereotypical package made my
life easier.  Redefining the term for myself meant that I would have
to expend some energy thinking about it, and there was simply no room
in which to do this.  Recent experiences have warranted much
introspective thought on my part, and due to my participation in a
collective called Your Sister's House, I have been given access into
the true "ism", seeing beyond the generalizations and viewing a
positive, empowering, and special phenomenon.
	Your Sister's House, a group of several women in San
Francisco, arose out of discontent about the state of the rave scene.
These women were mostly avid participants in "the scene" and, like
many of us who have participated in raves for some time, felt that a
certain energy and happiness was lacking from the parties of late.
Their concern for improving the scene led to an extraordinary series
of their own weekly parties on Thursday nights, called Your Sister's
House.  Beginning in June 1993, these parties were unique in several
ways.  Unlike most weekly clubs, Your Sister's House did not have a
regular location and was thus a "floating party", using different
locales in San Francisco almost every week.  Unlike any other club, it
started at 9 PM with a vegetarian meal and a discussions of concerns
facing people today (beyond the scene, there were discussions about
topics such as substance use, sex, and racism.)  Attempting to bring a
social responsibility to raves (a concept much talked about in the
scene but not much acted upon), huge amounts of information about
various community organizations, safe sex, responsible substance use,
and assorted philosophical musings were to be had at an information
table.  A five dollar donation was requested at the door, in stark
contrast to the higher prices that were currently in favor at other
clubs.  Most importantly though, what made Your Sister's House unique
were the DJs.  Long an oddity in the rave scene, female DJs were
featured here, surprising many people (including myself) who didn't
realize just how many of them there were.
	I have been intensely interested in music all of my life.  I
have been focusing my interests on the rave scene and the dance music
that encompasses itfor three years. An internship at a major radio
station in San Francisco had sparked my interest in becoming a
recreational DJ someday but I had never really done anything about it.
It was very inspiring to see so many women behind the decks, each
playing in their own unique style.  This encouragement and the
wonderful support of my boyfriend gave me the final "kick in the
pants" that I needed to learn how to do this.  I began practicing
constantly, and at the end of the summer, just before coming back to
UCLA, I produced a mixtape and submitted it to Your Sister's House.  I
played on September 16, and received a wonderful welcome, seeing at
least 100 smiling faces on my dancefloor for the entire two hours.
But beyond being a source of encouragement for myself and for other
women, there was something more.
	Upon reflection, I noticed that these parties differed from
others not only in the way that they were conducted, but they differed
in the makeup of the crowd and the "vibe" that the crowd consistently
put forth - the semblance of happiness and openness.  Your Sister's
House attracted one of the most diverse crowds that I have witnessed
at a rave.  There was a successful merging of female, male, gay,
lesbian, straight, young, old, Asian, Caucasian, African-American, and
Chicano/Chicana.  By providing "copious doses of female energy", more
people seemed to feel welcome than I had ever noticed in other, more
slightly "homogenized" parties.
	It was in this beautiful mix of people and the consistent good
time that seemed to be had by all week after week that made me
reassess my definition of feminism. I finally saw the "positive" side
of feminism, women working together not to detract from any other
group but to improve conditions for everyone.  The women of Your
Sister's House have been on a well-deserved break, hibernating for the
winter but expect to regroup and turn it out once again beginning in
March.  If you're ever up in San Francisco, give their voice mail a
ring at (415) 765-7670 and do not miss the experience.

Status: 


	Non-Rave related report.

	Friday a group of AIMsters and supporters began a march from 
Alcatraz to Washington DC.  Some 25 people have committed to walk the 
entire route of some 5-months duration.  The hopes to achieve to release
of Native American political prisoner Leonard Peltier, now languishing
in federal lockdown for 18 years.
	The presence of Peltier's mother at the sunrise ceremony over-
looking the bay, one of the clearest of the year, was perhaps the most
important political statement.  Seeing young punked-out teens protecting
the several 80 & 90 year old women dramatized a small part of what Native
American culture has to offer this WIRED world.
	As the rave community professes a new tribalism, I believe it is
important to understand, and possibly embrace their present struggles.
I was honored to be on Dennis Banks' drum, and lend my rhythm and heart
to the cause.  Playing a drum made for him at the founding of AIM, one that
pounded sounds for many important tribal events over the past several
decade was a profound experience.
	Despite the failed, misguided sentiments that drove several rave
rip-offs of native spirituality into the ground, the potential relationship
between the two cultures seems obvious, and important.  I trust that anyone
supporting the struggle to free Leonard, and the ongoing struggle for Native
rights in general, including land and religious issues, spend a portion of
each month's time/effort giving something back to what's left of the tribal
cultures struggling to preserve their remaining identity.  As Leonard has
become a symbol to Natives as Mandela is to many  South Africans, I also
believe it is important to give time and money to obtaining his freedom.
	Such symbiosis will benefit both communities, and we already 
realize the similarities between us.  Let's make events that truly build
on the potential of this relationship, and start by supporting what the 
Natives themselves deem important.
	I was truly stunned by the power in my heart with every beat of
the Dennis' drum.  Free Leonard!

Given current levels of automation and technology, we should only have to
work 5 hours per WEEK in order to provide all the material goods we need,
including houses &c.

Trouble is, there are too many people wanting to live in the same
place, so prices go up, and we spend all of our time earning more
money so we can crowd other people who don't have as much money out,
and guess what?  You're paying $1200 a month for a walk-up hellhole.
Why are rents cheap in the Midwest?  Because the cost of rental/buying
is much closer to the material and labor cost of actually making a
house as opposed to the bribe paid to the person who already had the
land.

Humans stepped out of the Garden of Eden the first time they settled in
one place and stopped hunting/gathering.  Once you plant stuff in the ground,
you have to make sure no one else takes it, and that's the beginning of 
"this is mine".

When you can only own what you can carry, private property isn't a big
problem.  This is the wisdom of many Native American tribes, as well
as many other indigenous peoples who didn't bother to claim land as
"theirs" and got destroyed by invaders who thought it was a big deal
and were willing to give up their lives to slavery (government) to
enforce their lines in the sand (or dirt, or rock ...)

> anarchy sounds good to me until someone has to fix the sewers.

You only need sewers when your population density is unsustainably high.
Every living creature on the Earth has taken dumps on the ground for eons.
It's part of the natural cycle of death and rebirth.  The trouble comes
when there is too much shit for natural processes to process quickly, and
it piles up, smells bad, and disrupts the balance.

This is the easiest way for people to tell if there are too many of them
in a given area -- can you all pee and dump in the vicinity without noticing
that anyone else does?  If so, some of you are surplus.

Guess what, that's almost all of us!  Hmm.  Now what?

Subject: Not rave related: sobriety checkpoints
Status: 

Hi,

I was wondering what you all think of the sobriety checkpoint
concept?  Pacifica is now doing random sobriety checks.  This means 
that on any (usually weekend) night of their choosing they pull over
trafic on a given section of Highway 1 and  1) ask if you have
been drinking  2) if you say yes you must go through a sobriety 
test  3) if you say no they give you a brochure about driving drunk.
Not really a hard test to pass if you understand the first question. :)
They don't pull over everyone, and I'm not sure what criteria 
they are using.  I live in Pacifica and I know two people that 
did get pulled over and two that did not and I can't really see 
what it was about these people that made one more suspect than
another.  The checkpoint itself consists of a mobile unit with a 
breathalizer and (I was told) 10-15 police units (could be less
I've noticed people have a tendency to exagerate when telling
about how many police are around :).  Nevertheless this seems like
overkill.

If you've heard anything about Pacifica police, or have had a run
in with them yourself you know that they can be a bit overbearing.
They also have a tendency to act on prejudices not only racial but
also based on personal appearance.  For this reason I am particularly
concerned about their motives behind these checkpoints.

I have mixed feelings about checkpoints themselves, I am discusted 
by drunk driving, but I also can't stand random interogation.
It seems to me that they are going about this in a questionable
manner.  They say that they're doing this for our safety and that
their purpose for the checkpoints is education and awareness.  They 
want people to know that they are out there and that driving drunk
is a serious risk.  But it seems to me that pulling anyone over
without probable cause just to give them a brochure is going a 
bit overboard.  They don't stop you for very long 10-15 minutes
I was told and this isn't a huge chunk of time but it can
still be inconvenient.

I am considering publicly voicing my opinions on this by calling
the police station and the local paper.  Before I do this I was
wondering if anyone out there had something to say, maybe point out
something that I've overlooked.

Thanks,
CC

Status: 

 I am writing to you from St. Louis where we also have random stops by the
police to check for drinking and driving.  The people here who I know that have
 been stopped, have not liked the situation.  It appears if they are biased on
the people who they stop.  If you are in your teens or early twenties, or have
a junky car(like mine) they will stop you for sure.  i belive this wrong, I
thought cops where only allowed to do random stops if they where random.  Also
they ask for your registration, liscence, proof of insurance, ect., and if you
are unable to produce them, they give you a ticket for that.  Another reason i
do not like it, is because the police are not out doing police things, like cat
ching robbers and such.  One of the TV stations did a report on this during the
 news,  all of the citizens they interviewed did not like it,  and wished for i
t to stop.

Subject: Checkpoints & the cops...
Status: 

Since I *always* use a designated driver (i.e. the one who is *least*
fucked up), I could care less about a checkpoint.

I also think the issue is pretty dead since the supreme court has already
ruled that they are constituionally correct, in most cases.  I am *very*
happy I live in SF, versus any of the other potential podunk suburbs that
surround this place and Berkeley.  Since SF is broke, they usually only
have checkpoints during the REAL heavy drinking times, like Saint Patrick's
Day, etc.  In reality I am all for them, as long as they do what they are
designed to do.  And you really have nothing to worry about *if* you're not
drunk, have a valid driver's license, registration is up to date, and have
no outstanding warrants.

As it realtes to raves, ravers/partiers (except the crew I hang around),
are generally not drinkers, so there is less to worry about.  However
ravers/partiers are generally drug takers, and that is a potential problem
if you cannot maintain during the stop.

I do think that if everyone were to just settle down, smoke a big fatty
before driving you *will* be less agrro, and more cautious.  So to prevent
accidents, light up, slow down, enjoy the scenery, and the feel of the
road.

Get blunted,

Subject: No more benefits....
Status: 

Since this year has started out so well, I was suprised to see certain
horses coming out of well used stables.  The benefit has returned, in many
guises and forms.  I can tell you this much...to everything there comes an
end, and as such, I think that it is time for all of these "benefits" to
end.

For one thing, most of the people in attendance could give a fuck who/what
the benefit is for (witness the massive confusion at *both* Malachy
benefits).  Next, I think that if there are "benefits" that they be geared
to a community or sector of society that genrally does not get much
attention.  So benefits for trees, whales, and overfunded diseases (read
AIDS), have enough money making power to stand on their own without the
"rave" community supporting them.

When will there be benefits for children's shelters (so far there was one,
but it had to split it's money with some rainforest tree action thang),
battered women, breast cancer, and homeless programs?  All of these are
quite worthy and underfunded causes that go hand in hand with this "world
peace, one love" credo often pushed by promoters.

The kids thang is really attractive to me since children (i.e.
non-legal-adults) have *no* voice in this society and as a result are
overlooked by everyone (read taxpayers).  Breast cancer has been completely
overshadowed by AIDS and it's funding has suffered as a result.  Also women
generally get short shrift in this society as a whole so...The honeless are
another group who is seen but often never heard.

I would like to see some benefits raised for "inner city" youth programs,
but considering the demographic of this, er, community, I doubt it would
pique much interest.

But this idea of a "benefit" for an individual is quite perplexing to me.
I mean it's fine for a one time thang, but when it is going into round
three I have strong objections.  So on the 19th, like soo manyh others, I
will be staying home. And every benefit thereafter that does not aid an
underrepresented sector of our society, will not get dollar one from me, or
most of my pals.  And maybe in time, the people who are *still* using this
as a cash/publicity cow, will get the message.

Staying home on the 19th and getting real blunted,
John

OK.  I have heard some great "rave" stories about individuals we all know

we all give our crfedo's for the year.  Just to let others know where we're
coming from.

My favorite, all the way back from '92 and making a serious return in
'93-'94 is:

Bathe before you rave!

Cage the funk, keep your shoes on!

Guest list credo:

After all is said and done, everyone pays for drinks.

So far the best one comes out of the present stance on copyright
infringement that has soooo many up in arms:

If they copy your song, sue 'em!  (Remember, in a litiginous society such
as our, the need to recoup financial compensation (i.e. make that buck)
outweighs all of the other ills of our society, like racism, sexism, and
all the other ism's.)

      -or-

Sue 'em, and let god sort them out!

I agree with this completely.  I have on two occasions written down
license plates of obvious drunk drivers and called them in.  
That driving drunk is wrong and dangerous is something that I fully
understand.  I think that most people on this list are clear on
this.  Kinda like preaching to the choir. :)

> personally i don't care how biased cops are in this case...i hope they
> catch every fucking single intoxicated driver on the road!

The point is, if they are biased, they won't be catching
every drunk driver on the road.  This is the first problem that
I have with the whole thing, the second is that if they had the
10+/- cops at the check there were parts of town in which there
wasn't any police presence.  Who knows how many people were 
driving dangerously through these areas.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Pacifica police are *bored*.
I could tell countless stories about things they have done to 
make their jobs interesting.  This isn't too say that I don't 
appreciate that they are here when I need them, I have needed 
them, and they have done a good job.  I don't want to police
bash, but as someone who pays for them I feel the need to 
question their methods from time to time.

Also because there aren't many good jobs out there.
They also have a miserable climate  (it hit 40 below there a few weeks ago).
The scenery is flat and boring and so are most of the people.
There also aren't any raves (well, hardly any), in fact, almost no music scene
at all unless you like country music.

Which probably started happening shortly after they discovered that everything

miles they saw more of the same.

What is sustainable for an agricultural society is higher than what is

Subject:  Review of A Rave Called Sharon.
Status: 

OK, here's a review of this weekend's A Rave Called Sharon:


But first, a caveat:  I don't normally slam events.  In fact, I've
been a bit put off by recent reviews which I thought have been
overly critical.  For example, I went to the Gathering last week and
thought it was wonderful!  No one on this list even mentioned that
the Gathering provided FREE bottled water, a warm clean space,
plenty of bathrooms, and lots of places to sit!

However, having said that, here's a brief rundown of A Rave Called
Sharon...

We arrived at 10:30 pm and got in line.  There was maybe 50 people
in front of us.  We brought our canned food donation so I figured
that we'd be in by 10:45 - time enough to get the advertised
discount on admission.  Boy, was I wrong.  It took us over an hour
to get to the door.

Once at the door, the security guard asked to search my bag.  I
don't have any problems with this.  In fact, I prefer to have all
bags searched.  I don't like the idea that people might be carrying
weapons into a venue.  In any event, I realized that they probably
wouldn't let me bring in a bottle of water, so I finished that
before I got to the door.  I used to work in a nightclub, and
realize that there is LOTS of money to be made in drink sales - OK,
fine.  However, the security guard took my bananas (I had two) and
said, "Don't ask questions."   I couldn't believe it.  He was nice
enough and seemed to be embarrassed to do so, but that still sucks.
I should have left at that point, but there were 8 other people with
me, 4 of which had already gone in.  So, I gave up my bananas
without complaint.

I had a Tupperware container with about 2 dozen chocolate chip
cookies in it as well.  The guard said that I had to give those up
as well!  Now I was getting pissed.  I asked why - again I was given
the answer, "Don't ask." He said to leave the container with the
pile of water bottles that they had confiscated.  I thought to
myself, "Bullshit on that!" He'd probably just eat them.  Besides,
Tupperware isn't cheap.  I asked if I could take them back to the
car - he said, OK.  I then asked if I'd have to wait in line or if
he'd let me cut to the front.  He said that I'd have to wait in line
again.  SHIT!  So, I dumped the cookies on the floor and kicked them
into the corner with the pile of water, paid and went in.

Two of my friends that were behind me had food as well.  A different
guard searched them.  He told them to take their food back to the
car.  They didn't think to ask if they'd have to wait in line again,
so they returned to the car.  Imagine their surprise when they
weren't let back to the front of the line!

In the meantime, I didn't know that this had happened, so I joined
my friends that had gone in.  We waited for our final two members to
come in.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, after
about 30 minutes, I asked the door person if I could go out to find
them.  Of course, I was told a firm, "NO - unless you want to pay to
get in again."  Another goon came down the hallway and yelled at me
to move out of the hall - even though I was talking to the door
person.

Now, about this space.  It was in a cheesy club called, Atlantis.
It consisted of:  one hallway (the one I was getting yelled at for
standing in); one sort of ambient room (about 20 feet by 30 feet)
with cargo netting strung from the ceiling (complete with one
blacklight, a strobe, and some really shitty visuals - gee, the
screen size was probably almost 4 feet by 8 feet); one main dance
area (40 feet by 50 feet?) that had a couple of strobes, a white
light that was sort of like a flashlight on an electric motor, and a
disco ball; and finally, a small cafeteria/diner sort of room that
had about 4 booths to sit in.

My guess at the total floor space is about 4500 square feet,
including the coatcheck room and hallway.  Into this were packed
WAY too many people.  It was hot and stuffy.  Dancing was next to
impossible.  There was only enough room to bounce up and down.  You
had to crawl/climb over people to get from one room to another or
down the hallway.

OK, so there we are:  7 out of 9 of us waiting for our other 2
friends.  We waited, and waited.  Finally, after we had just made
the decision to leave and find them, they were let in.  A total of 1
hour and 30 minutes after I got in.  Of course, after they returned
from their car, the security people made them wait in line all over
again.

We then decided to try some dancing, but soon became too hot to
manage.  Besides, things were so crowded that we were constantly
being bumped into, shoved, etc.  After confirming that the Sharon
people were still admitting people to this overcrowded space, we
decided that it would be in our best interests to leave.  So, I
headed to the coatcheck to get my fiance's jacket.  It took the
coatcheck girl 15 minutes to find her jacket.  During this time, one
of the security goons came by 4-5 times and yelled at me to clear
the hallway.  This was after I told him that I was getting my
fiance's jacket!  He finally threatened to physically remove me if I
didn't clear the hallway - it wasn't until I screamed at both him
and the coatcheck person that I was trying to get the fuck out, but
wasn't going to leave without my jacket.  The coatcheck girl finally
told him that she was really looking for my jacket, so he eventually
left me alone.  Oh yeah, the coatcheck was $2.00.

When I finally got my fiance's coat, we left.  It took over 5
minutes to crawl - literally - over people in order to get out onto
the street level.  This space was so overcrowded that this confirmed
our decision to leave.  I cannot imagine what would have happened
had there been a fire in that space.

So, we went back to San Jose and spent the remainder of the evening
at a friend's house listening to music, watching movies, etc.


That's it!  Talk about a waste of money.  My advise to all - DON'T
EVER GO TO A SHARON RAVE!  This has been stated on the net before, I
just can't emphasize this enough.


Of course, all of the above is IMO :)


- Chris


Oh, yeah - there were no supplies (ie. toilet paper or towels) in
the bathrooms!

You don't get that luxury.  The implementation is up to whoever does
it, and they will stop whoever they want at a checkpoint.  Once they
have this right, they will (and do) use it to justify other
encroachments on your freedom, all under the guise of safety and
saving that "one more life".

If you believe that one life is more important than your freedom, then
you should agitate to outlaw cars altogether, not to mention
pesticides, nuclear power, airplanes, motorcycles, bungee jumping,
skiing, hiking in the mountains, bicycles, steak knives, toothpicks,
raving, bees, abortion, nail guns, and all heavy or sharp objects, not
to mention all poisonous plants and just about every species of
animal.  All have killed people at one time or another, and would have
been preventable had they been illegal.

Besides, governments have killed more people over the centuries than
automobiles, handguns, and industrial accidents can ever hope to.
Rivers of blood are being spilled right now across the world over who
gets to be the government.  If you want to minimize the killing of
innocents, start figuring out how to survive without government right
now, and do it.

ObRave: What's the big deal about Aphex Twin that I'm missing?  I
bought Selected Ambient Works expecting something amazing, and all I
hear is Richard diddling around on some old Roland gear under heavy

instruments?  I'm bummed.  Sure, "We Are The Music Makers" is kinda
nice to listen to, but it's nothing that special.

** Checkpoints
(rave relevance: ummm, you might drive thru one on your way to a rave?)

Checkpoints used to confuse me.  It seems like the 5-10 police who
hang out in one spot could catch a greater number of "obvious" drunk
drivers if they were on different patrols.

The checkpoints are going to catch people who are barely over the
legal blood alcohol limit and who don't think they are drunk. 

These people are arguably less dangerous to the public than the
reckless driving, swerving really drunk drivers who would be 
definitely stopped by a patroling police officer.   

From a personal freedom perspective, I don't think the checkpoints

** Shit
(rave relevance: I give up, use your imagination!)

Welcome to the 1990's 

I don't think shitting behind bushes is a very good measure of the
population an area can support. 

It's not about land and owning it or carrying a Sun workstation in
your backpack as you hike across the open plains. 

People live in crowded, popular areas because they want or need the
variety of other people who can be found nearby.

That's the fun part about cities.

A little sewer technology and a higher cost of living damn near
define modern civilization.   ;)

Ever taken cold medication, driven to work, and found during the trip
that it hit harder than you expected?  Then you drove intoxicated.

Tell me you've never operated a motor vehicle when you've been ill,
angry, distracted, or tired, all of which affect your judgement and
ability to control a motor vehicle.

True, people shouldn't drive fucked-up.  People shouldn't do lots of
things they do every day.

> personally i don't care how biased cops are in this case...i hope they
> catch every fucking single intoxicated driver on the road!

I think you mean every single fucking intoxixated driver, unless you
only want the police to catch drunk masturbating drivers :-).

There are always plenty of people who will solve all our problems for
us, if we'd only be so kind as to surrender our libery to them.  Such
people are not to be trusted, and should never be accomodated.

Drunk driving is a problem, but is a much smaller problem in the US
than, say, poverty.  Notice that drunk driving fanatics always use
highly suspect statistics, such as "half of all accidents are
alcohol-related."  Hey, all accidents are "water-related" by that
definition.  The correlation of two phenomena does not imply
causation.  I suspect that better statistics don't exist, or they'd be
used.  

While being trashed does affect your ability to drive, I have never
seen decent statistics on how many addional traffic injurys and
fatalities are caused by drinking, nor have I seen decent statistics
on how much impairment is required to noticeably increase risk.

Loud car stereos increase your chances of getting in a wreck.  Should
they be banned?  Pets in the car increase your chances of getting in a
wreck.  Should they be banned?  You shouldn't drive in situations
where you can't safely operate the vehicle.  A legal blood alcohol,
combined with other factors, may mean that you still shouldn't drive.
Some people, under some circumstances, can drive safely with illegal
blood alcohol levels.  It's obviously risky as far as being illegal,
but that doesn't make it less true.  Of course, alcohol affects
judgement, so it can be a little hard to reliably determine that you
are straight enough to drive.

As far as I can tell, the anti-drunk-driving crusade is composed of
two main forces, a "temperance" faction that would like to prevent
people from getting fucked-up by making it as difficult as possible to
do so, and a totalitarian faction that uses drunks as a cover for
depriving us of our civil rights.  I consequently have little respect
for or trust of the anti-drunk driving movement.

Don't drive drunk.  Don't hand over your liberty, especially for
questionable gains.  Don't unquestioningly believe what authority
figures tell you.

Oh, and don't tell a cop you've been drinking.

Well, by that logic we ought to allow the police to search your homes

Rave report
===========

Thursday:

  Yow!!  No more SpaceLab -- This is screwed!!  But after checking out
my trusty Rave Guide,  thanx to those tireless people in SFRaves providing
us this GREAT service,  I noticed that "This Old House" was happening.
Before that,  we went to Nikkies BAr and Grill down on Haight st.   They
were pumping out a lot of FUNK and Jazz.    A good variaty of beats were
available to move your body around the fairly small dance floor,  but
we weren't planning to stay long,  as we just hooked up with a few more
friends.   After that,  we started to head out to "This Old House".

  It was in a NEW VENUE I have't yet been in,  so what the heck!!  I
deided to go.    Matt stayed home,  but Aaron decided to join me,   dispite
the fact he was very tired,  but he was willing to come along and if he
wanted to,  he could crash in my car.

   The Venue was located at the end of FELL st.   Right on the corner at
Market St.    As I rounded around the building I could hear some pretty
good housey sounds booming around,  coming from Anton's turn tables.

   The folks at the door were very courtious,  so I payed them the $5,
got stamped,  and entered the place.   Near the door were some tables in 
a darkened room,   nobody was even in there yet.    I entered the main
area,  where there was a rather small dance area,   and only a small number
of people were actually in the place.   I would say about 40 - 50 or so.

   The usual crowd were there,  but not that many SFRavers,  I met a few,
then started to dance.   Good tunes,  funkey at times,  but traditional
old skool house pretty much measuring up to the Raves list speal.

   Later on,  it was starting to pick up,  especially when Garth got behind
the turn tables.   Really good long sets,  few breaks,  kept me on the
dance floor for long periods of time.    great dancing area,   wasn't that
crowded,   but fairly small.

   About 2:30,  the music suddenly stopped,  and word got out that the
faschist SF pigs put a stop to it.   Drats!! I was told it was to last until
at least 4 am.   Oh well,  so I left,  and headed home.


Saturday:

  Friday evening,  we didn't go out to anything,  because of our work on
a special project we are working on.


Saturday:

   Went to the TAZ party on the Haight,  a small private party,   as we
waited until the Sharon lines died down.     Yukk!!  So they say,  get there before
11 pm and it's $15.   HAH!! What a fuckin joke....   There NO way one can
wait in line to make that low price unless they get out there 2 hours before
it starts.

   It was held in the Atlantis club at 1'st and Harrison.    As we drived
by at about 10:30,   I decided there was NO WAY I could make the 11 pm
deadline and save some money,   so we went to the TAZ party instead.

   At about 2 am,   headed back to the Sharon rave at Atlantis,   and noticed
there was a small LINE at that point.    I had hoped that Carlos had remembered
to put be on his guest list.   But that was un-necessary,  as Garth was walking
up toting his racord case,   and he let me enter with him.    GREAT!!   Sure
was glad that I didn't have to contribute to the Sharon promoters riches,  as
I've heard a lot of negative things about the promoters.

   As I was pushing through the very crowded hallway,   I noticed the same
Goons were there that were at 16th and Harrison.    Oh Shit!!  Not the same
16th and Harrison goons again.   Sheesh!!  How fucked.    As usual,  due to
the tight security controls by the faschist goons,   the place was very hot
and stuffy.    The dance floor was so crowded that the only dancing directions
one can do is in the vertical direction,  so I decided to first check out the
venue,  see who was there,   and decide how long I wanted to stay.

   This venue is also used by Groove Sunday,  an afterparty.   Hmmm!!  I
wonder how they will handle things in the morning.

   After discovering they actually had an outside "chill area",   I decided
to stay,   then headed for the dance area.    I managed to find a big enough
space to move around in,   and actually enjoyed the great tunes.    Don't
know who the DJ was,  as it was a hassle just to move around in the place.
Dance time vs chill out times was really fucked.    About 10 minutes,  
before getting totally drenched,  and 10 minutes to chill.     Hmmm!
Perhaps we should rate raves in units of DTCT (Dance time Vs Chill Time).
Where about 95% is good and anything less than about 75% would be pretty
bad.

   They had another dance area in the front part,  and temperature was
almost reasonable with DTCT about 80%.   But in order to get to the chill
area,   I had to crawl through tons of people to get to the back where
the outside chill area existed.    In the outside area,  they had a carpet
out on the asphalt area,  which was rather comfortable.

   All too soon,  the goons started to clear out the chill area,  just as
I finished a long dance set.   Holy Shit!!   The bastards wouldn't even
let me stand by the door in the cooler hallway.   This almost reminded
me of one of the events I attended at 174 King st.   

   At about 5:30 the music stopped,   and as I was standing around the
front,  rapping to people,  I hear gunshots in the area,   and everyone 
headed into the front doors of Atlantis.    At that point,  I cautiously
left,  headed for my car and got out of the area.    I drove by the End Up,
and it was still closed.    I headed out to get something to eat.

   Eventually,  I wound up at the DNA lounge,  where it was practically
empty.   Really good DJ's,  and is most unfortunate that people don't
come here.

Beach Party
===========

   Got Info on a beach party,   decided to check it out,   and WOW!! Great
warm weather,   and it's location was great.   Near some stables,   and only
a single house that might be of earshot of the music.   The area was way
down a steep cliff.   So we stumble down just as the music was starting up.

   Got into some pretty groovy tunes,   dug the warm sunshine,   and got
some sun.    After a while,  I wanted to get my sweatshirt,  so headed
back to my car,   climbed the steep cliff.     After returning,  I get
word that the faschist SF pigs decided that it was against the law to
have a beach party.   Strike two for the SF fashist pigs.

   Anyway,   as far as the best party this weekend,  I would have to
say that Sharon was the worst by far...   Probably because of their
selection of fashist goons,  and their unreasonable expectations that
aanyone can get in before 11 pm and save $5.    After that,  then $20
price was far far unreasonable for what we had to put up with the
constant goon harrassment.   So,  it is my utter conclusion that these
raves put on by Sharon should be either boycotted,   or some effort
should be made to get the word to the promoters that things MUST change,
and until they do,  lets not go to them.

   The best was the beach party....

Exactly. The police are serching for a crime without a warrent, but because the 
crime is considered so horrible it's OK.  The police also pat search just
about anyboby 
in a crack ridden area without a warrent. Now that they've gone this far,
just how far is it to setting up sidewalk drug checkpoints, (say near a rave), 
because of the dangerous things those kids do when they're under the
influence.

Poor logic my dear friend.  A raod is public, and therefore the public
trust/safety is weghed against the rights of the individual to it's use.
Your house is *not* public, so your logic, under this circumstance does not
hold.

If you believe that there is no "safe" level of alcohol, then you are
right.  However, there is probably always _some_ level of blood
alcohol, from non-beverage sources (mouthwash use means most people
have a measurable blood-alcohol for the morning commute), breakdown
products of other things we ingest, and so on.  So, if there is no
"safe" level of alcohol, then a huge percentage of all car trips are
performed by people with "unsafe" levels of alcohol, and we just
shouldn't drive.

Assuming that we want to continue driving, then there must be a "safe"
level at which all drivers can drive safely, given that they are not
driving unsafely for other reasons.  Oregon and California, for
example, set this level at 0.08% of blood alcohol.  Some states still
have a level of 0.1% alcohol, but the ones that have dropped to 0.08%
did not see changes in arrest or accident behavior, so that it seems
0.08% does in fact lie below the threshold of safety.

Now, tolerance for alcohol varies widely, even corelating against
blood alcohol as opposed to amount consumed.  There are genetic
variations, and tolerance effects, to the point where the typical alcoholic
Scandinavian starts to have their driving safety affected at a much
higher blood alcohol than the typical light-drinking Asian.

Therefore, if ALL drivers are safe at 0.08, some if not most drivers
will be safe at higher concentrations of blood alcohol.  Maybe only a
little higher, maybe quite a bit more.

To repeat your comment, 

> I know i dont' want to be driving on a road where people judge
> for themselves how fucked up they are

Today, people have to judge for themselves what they think their blood
alcohol is.  Most people have no idea how to judge that, I certainly
don't.  If you are on something other that alcohol, or some admixture,
you have to decide if you are "visibly intoxicated," which comes much
closer to "not straight enough to drive."

So, when you drive, you have no choice but to drive on roads where
people are deciding for themselved how fucked-up they are, and most of
them don't even know what the legal definition of fucked-up feels
like.

> but i just don't see where driving drunk is implied in the
> constitution

Driving is not just a "privledge."  Modern life and most modern cities
are constructed such that you need a car to fully participate.  You
need a car to fully exercise your constitutional right of assembly in
Los Angeles.  If I couldn't drive, I would lose my job.

I agree that setting things up this way is a mistake, but I can't
single-handedly change that.  I drink with people as a course of work.
I need to get home to my hotel or my house afterwards, so I take a lot
of cabs.  Sometimes, you can't get a cab, so you wait around until you
are pretty damn sure you are not drunk and hopeful that you won't fall
asleep on the way home, and you drive.  I imagine I've driven above
0.08%, but I can't prove it because I've never measured my blood
alcohol.

I wish I didn't have to drive, it's expensive, dangerous, and boring.
But I have to drive to pursue happiness as I understand it, and I have
to drink for the same reasons.  It's real hard to keep the two
completely separate.

Not everybody should be allowed to drive, but almost everybody does.
Something like 25% of all drivers in Oregon drive with no insurance,
which is illegal.  Most of these probably don't have insurance because
their driving records are so bad that they can't get insurance.

We issue driving licenses on the merest of provocations, without any
required training.  We allow almost anything that runs onto the road.
We provide mediocre alternatives to driving.  And we act shocked that
people drive abysmally.  I'm a shitty driver.  I'm probably better
than most Americans, I probably drive more sober than most, and I
probably have a higher tolerance than most.  That's pretty scary.

Status: 

I have never been into Halim.

I have never been into his tweeky drugged out friends.

I have never liked the IDEA of a Sharon party...

I have been to one Sharon and found that the experience really sucked.

Halim still owes people money, I hope everyone gets/got paid.

But his tepid attempts at making money and throwing the biggest party ever
has inspired many a partygoer to become party producers, dj's, helpers,
crew.  This is a good thing.

You know a party sucks when it's namesake (i.e. Sharon) doesn't even go to
the party named after her.

Halim has thrown parties in cow dung.

and like a Mantra...

Halim still owes people money.....

It sure is.  This quote/comment made a huge impression on me when I
first heard it, and still does, though it was applied to
reuse/recycling of paper:

"You can't throw anything away.  There is no 'away'."

Where do you think your turds go when you flush?  The moon?  Pardon me
for bringing up an uncomfortable subject, but they end up somewhere
near you.  Maybe if we're lucky a treatment plant breaks them up with
mass microbial action and turns them into fertilizer, like in Milwaukee.
Maybe they just get dumped into the Bay after being chlorinated.
Either solution implies something that is returned to the land
eventually, but in what form?  If you want to support a city you have
to support a much larger unpopulated area around it to deal with the waste,
roughly equal to if everyone did just whiz in the snow.  Of course,
most people don't believe this now, so we gunk up the countryside with
dumps and the watershed with shit and toxins, and hope it'll all go
away sometime.  Another good measure of too many people is if you 
can't drink the water.  You can't even do that now in areas considered
'wilderness' because of giardia, which live on too many people and
livestock feces in the water.  Ask anyone who's had it if you want
to know how serious that problem is.  It sucks to be climbing in 
Desolation Wilderness at 7500 feet and have to take those little iodine
pills in order to drink from the clear mountain streams.

> A little sewer technology and a higher cost of living damn near
> define modern civilization.   ;)

Sewer technology generally means you get to ignore the consequences of
your actions until it's too late to reverse them.  A higher cost of living
isn't a necessary part of modern civilization.

Imagine for a moment if no one could own land or property that they did
not live on -- much like what would happen if the police state was not
around to protect property 'rights'.  It's a nice thought, anyway.

I agree that driving under influence of alcohol is careless and sometimes 
potentially murderous  But is driving
really a privilege?  Aren't privileges usually "allowed" by some higher force?
If so, who is it that you worship to bestow upon you this privilege of driving?
Don't we pay the state taxes to pay for roads and traffic signs and traffic 
lights 
as well as a lot of road-contruction corruption and don't we pay for our gas 
and for our cars?  Don't we obey the traffic rules and pay for cops' salaries
to "supposedly" catch those who aren't?  By god, it's not a privelege, WE and a
few generations before us have made it happen!  

>personally i don't care how biased cops are in this case...i hope they
>catch every fucking single intoxicated driver on the road!
I just hope people would stop driving while under the influence, I do not want
EVERY driver's freedoms to be stripped in the name of stopping every single
intoxicated driver.

The Sharon promoter HAVE gotten word.  They just don't care to change it. For
them, it's a tried and tested way to make lots of dough everytime they're 
close to running out.  I have boycotted Sharons since long ago and my review
of the Sharon at Longshoreman's hall about 2 years ago? seems to match

It has nothing to do with the extent of the crime.  It has to do with
probable cause.  If the police do not have probable cause, they can only
check for anything within sight (hence the flashlight).  If they do have
probable cause, they can search your vehicle, but you have the right to
refuse them entry into your trunk.  If you do, then they must obtain a
warrant to search any futher.> 
You have redress if you feel your rights have been violated.  The police
must prove probable cause in court.
 >  > 
These procedures also apply to houses and other areas of privacy (like
telephone booths).  The police must have probable cause to search your
home.  For the most part, they must obtain a warrant, unless they feel
that evidence will be removed in the process.  Again, they must prove this
in court.
Without probable cause, police can only observe what is in eyeshot--from
outside your home (from 20 ft).  So if you don't like visual intrusion,
keep your blinds drawn.
These laws were created to deter crime and protect the individual. 
Abolishing the law is an irrational and detrimental way of solving the
problem--that all of you are doing drugs illegally.  If you want to change
the law, work toward legislation which creates a classification of drugs
and legalizes those which you feel are not immediately threatening (like
herb, sid, x...etc).  

Otherwise, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime.
Sincerely,
A Moderate with conservative tendencies (in this case).

the Nitrate record is certified 100% to give you flashbacks and frekouts
it is viscious, corrosive, lethal, and 100% toxic acid music. i would
suggest playing this one at 4am after a set of gabberhouse. for some
reason this record reminds me of what it sounds like when a UFO's

enter an ethereal zone beyond a black hole somewhere..... very creepy

I'm not sure this is a good idea, the officialdom is eager enough to shut
things down, this just gives them ammunition which they may also use on
good parties  (more likely than shutting down the bad ones, it seems).
They can use your phone call as part of the "community input" to push for
tighter regulation of all parties.

Besides, getting it shut down after most everybody's in already probably
saves the promoters money, since they got everybody's $20 already, and this
way they might not have to pay the DJs or their own people for a full night,
and the poor sots who paid to get in get even LESS of what they paid for
than they would have otherwise.

Better to just make sure that people have something better and cheaper
to go to the next time there's a rave called Sharon.

I just got through listening to  Jack Diamond's mediaHype record that I got
from, er Jack (i.e. Chris Hart), himself.

The lyrics (read rapping) is good.  reminds me of Disposable Heroes, but
waaaay more funky.  Very, very old skool feel, and that's what makes the
tracks so fresh!

Although I like the rapping (and am anxious to hear a live treatment of
Jacks vocals to a variety of music), the instrumentals are really fresh,
and quite FAT! Nice bass, great use of samples, and transforming (on track
1 side 1) done
just the way I like it.

Check out track 2 (side 2) - rap Like This, intrumental.
Track 1 (side 1) - Piano break.  I could listen to this during the morning,
or after a big hit off a fatty.

Nice one Chris!  I look forward to hearing more from Tenderloin Waxx!

Audi,
John

Note for all techno ravers:  This ain't no techno, house, nuthin!  It's
funky ass hip-hop served straight up, no ice and no fuckin' chaser!!!

Listen, I am half Scandanavian and I find this an extreme waste of time
reading these half-wit thoughts on checkpoints and drinking.  Like someone
menitoned earlier driving is a priviledge.  Its not a personal experience
like dropping or having a baby.  Who cares if Scandanavians have a higher
drinking tolerance! Who cares if the police piss you off if you are asked
if you have been drinking or whatever.  I'd rather drive with a pissed off
person in front of me or some crazy miscreant tailgating me than a fuckin'
blitzed bonehead weaving back and forth without a futher thought of
someone else's life.  Those checkpoints are there for safety.  Yeah, maybe
they were a dick to you.  Brush it off and thank God that you are still
alive to drive your damn car.  My dad was a cop and had to put up with the
strain and stress of attitude like the ones I've been hearing lately here.
Just remember who you call when someone breaks into your house or
apartment or you or a friend gets raped.  If I piss anyone off, I do
apologize.  I'm not trying to flame anyone or their own opinions;  I, too,
have done my share of cursing those pigs under my breath.  But I look at
the other side of the coin.  Everyone makes mistakes even asshole cops.
But lets just realize what they are trying to do-  make the road safer for
us and our friends at 3,4,5 in the morning when we have to drive home from
a night of dancing...Well, I've said my $.02 worth (I know I'm going get
it for this one=)!

Nope.  Your concept of anarchy is the media's.  True anarchy allows for
groups of people to form  societies based upon interdependence and mutal
need.  Different kinds of laws, mores, ethics are developed around such
standards.  For instance, the Native American people, before the European
holocaust basically lived in anrchic societies.  The same can be said of
many tribes of peoples (both nomadic and non) in Africa.  Our present form
of govt. is directly evolved from the Romans, who were far from anarchic.
They believed in order to the nth.

However, I do not think at this stage people (on the whole) are ready to
accept such concepts as valid.  I know at this stage in my life I am not.
However, I do recognize the potential benefits of such a society.  My main
problem with it is does it allow an anarchic society to prosper agianst
other societies that do not use/believe in the anarchic model.  History has
shown us that greed and the need for aquisition easily outpowers the
general amicable nature of anarchy.  Thus the vicious and ruthless spread
of Western Civilization.

Everyone needs to learn new ways of thinking before embarking on a new way.
Marx however did not think that such institutions would be necessary
forever.

>Whatever we were in the past, we are no longer.  We cannot regress to the

Your statement in genrally incorrect.  Mankind is just as brutal,
opportunistic, stubborn, and exploitative as we ever were.  As Khan once
said "...it is suprising how little humans have changed".  As for
regression, who ever said we have become advanced?  We still hate those
that are different, even though we have the intellectual capacity to love
everyone.  We still kill  living things in a wasteful way.  We live in
excess of the earth's capcity to maintain us. Come to think of it, we
already HAVE regressed into a more brutal and calculating, and wasteful
society.  The tribes are now drawn along economic lines, and then
political.  As for roaming, this society is just as nomadic as ever.  The
average family moves 7 or more times (according to the cencus and GAO),
there really is no sense of community (unless your very rich , then you can
live in a gated and sealed community.  Sealed off from all "undesirables").

The idea of some overbearing group to monitor anything is exactly the kind
of mess anarchy tries to avoid.  Popel come to a consensus.  The needs of
the many, reached by the many.  This is different than a majority rule ,
where it is done by sheer numbers, usually along racial, ethnic,
socioseconmoic lines.  Since this US of A was founded by the rich, the laws
have been constructed in such a way to gurantee their continued prosperity,
while the many suffer.  Nope, I do not think that big govt. is the answer,
except when it comes to roads, and waterworks, and even then, sparingly.

Anarchic societies have their own way of dealing with miscreants.
Banishment, or even death.  Much more efficient than our present means.

Wrong.  For all that it's worth I think that the "rave" community, at least
from my vantage point attempts to do this.  The problem is people have a
difficult time getting past the dance and the drugs.  On an individual
basis, I have made many new friends, and established many fruitful caring
relationships.  This is not to say that rave is an answer (I do not beleive
that it is), but it does show that people from divergent backgrounds can
get together without weapons and fighting nad have a good time.  I see
groups of people take care of each other all the time when I'm out.  The
best thing to see is to see these relationships blossom beyond the dance,
and extend themselves into general living.

I personally like breasts, period.  All any woman needs for jsl is  some
nice "back".  Not a flat one, but a real live onion!  I am talking the kind
of woman who, from a side view, is not flat as a board when it comes to the

Nope.  Dismantling is the key.  This govt. is nothing more than the Roman
Empire on steroids.  And people in this society are just as complacent as
the best Roman citizen.  We serve 'em TV, and they're hooked.  Look at the
time spent on Tonya "boongy" Harding (btw there is a REASON guys like her),
on the rating of video games, on violent lyrics/movies.  No time whatever
spent on issues of health, the homesless, social diseases such as poverty.
Even the famed welfare reform; it's goal is to get as many people off of
welfare as possible, but does not address getting people out of poverty.
It's all smoke and mirrors.  This is nothing but the famed "bread and
circuses".  This govt. needs to be completley dismantled, and people need
to spend some time reading the constitution, and reading in general.  Maybe
then they will appreciate what the constituion tries to provide, and maybe
I will then be able to trust us all to come up with something better.
SOmething that respects the individual, but is not remiss in adressing the
needs of a burgeoning society.  A set of laws that respects everyones
rights to be who they are as long as they do not impose on others rights to
be who they are.

Our current govt. and constition are far from this ideal of plurality.

Can't truss this,

Here's something I nabbed from misc.invest (where it was completely

I still found it to be somewhat insightful.  ObRave: in an ideal society, 
we'd have more time for raving ;-).  Seriously, though, I agree with JSL 
that the house community at least attempts to espouse and act out many of 
the ideals that would make this world a better place for most to live in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

>From "Small is Beautiful" by E.F. Schumacher

'Right Livelihood' is one of the requirements of the Buddha's Noble
Eightfold Path.  It is clear, therefore, that there must be such a 
thing as Buddhist economics.

The ideal [ in modern economics ] from the point of view of the
employer is to have output without employees, and the ideal from
the point of view of the employee is to have income without 
employment.

The Buddhist point of view takes the function of work to be at least
threefold: to give a man a chance to utilize and develop his 
facilities; to enable him to overcome his ego-centredness by joining
with other people in a common task; and to bring forth the goods
and services needed for a becoming existence.

The very start of Buddhist economic planning would be a planning 
for full employment, and the primary purpose of this would in fact
be employment for everyone who needs an 'outside' job.

But Buddism is 'The Middle Way' and therefore in no way antagonistic
to physical well-being.  It is not wealth that stands in the way
of liberation but the attachment to wealth; not the enjoyment of 
pleasurable things but the craving for them.

[ The modern economist ] is used to measuring the 'standard of 
living' by the amount of annual consumption...

The Buddhist economist would consider this approach excessively
irrational; since consumption is merely a means to human well-being,
the aim should be to obtain the maximum of well-being with the 
minimum of consumption.

Modern economics, on the other hand, considers consumption to be
the sole end and purpose of all economic activity...

[ Buddhist economics ] tries to MAXIMIZE HUMAN SATISFACTIONS by the 
OPTIMAL PATTERN of CONSUMPTION, while [ modern economics ] tries
to MAXIMIZE CONSUMPTION by the OPTIMAL PATTERN OF PRODUCTIVE EFFORT.
It is easy to see that the effort needed to sustain a way of life
which seeks to attain an optimal pattern of consumption is likely
to be much smaller than the effort needed to sustain a drive for
maximum consumption.

Simplicity and non-violence are obviously closely related.  The 
optimal pattern of consumption, producing a high degree of human
satisfaction by means of a relatively low rate of consumption, 
allows people to live without great pressure and strain...

Equally, people who live in highly self-sufficient local 
communities are less likely to get involved in large-scale 
violence than people whose existence depends on world-wide
systems of trade.

The Buddhist economist would hold that to satisfy human wants
from faraway sources rather than from sources nearby signifies
FAILURE rather than success. 

Non-renewable goods must be used only if they are indispensable,
and then only with the greatest care...  To use them heedlessly
or extravagantly is an act of violence...

It is clear that their exploitation at an ever-increasing rate
is an act of violence against nature which must almost invariably
lead to violence between men.

Well as long as that is what they are trying to do, I don't have a 
problem with checkpoints.  In fact I don't have a problem with checkpoints
that stop EVERYONE. But when they stop selectively, then it is a problem.
I may be specifically sensitive to this being an african-american male but
the bottom line is that I tend to get stopped and pulled over MUCH more then
any of my white friends and frankly I'm tired of it.

Seriously, did it not give you pause to accuse someone named Erik
Nilsson of racism against Scandinavians?  Det ar mycket roligt.

I did not mean to imply that all Scandinavians are alcoholics, what I
meant is that Scandinavians tend to have a high tolerance for alcohol,
and alcoholics tend to have a high tolerance for alcohol, so that
someone who is both alcoholic and Scandinavian is very likely to have
a high tolerance for alcohol.  

s/alcoholic Scandinavian/Scandinavian alcoholic/

Interstingly, in my experience drinking and driving is much less
common in Scandinavia, compared with the US.  I attribute this to a
several factors:

 - the transportation systems of Scandinavia make is less likely that
   you will be stranded somewhere in a drunken state.

 - alcohol is very expensive in Scandinavia (like, 1 bar drink >= $20)

 - Scandinavians generally have more respect for the law than
   Americans do.


Low drunk driving (and high tolerance among drunk drivers) is one
reason that Scandinavia is a comparitively safe place to drive a car.
There are other important factors:

 - Extensive driver training is generally required to obtain a
   driver's license.

 - Cars are required to be inspected for proper operating condition on
   a regular basis.

 - Drivers are required to drive with their lights on.

 - Speeding tickets are very expensive, up to ten times more expensive
   than the US.

 - Scandinavia is much more homogenous than the US.  Combined with
   driver training, this reduces cultural and regional differences in
   driving style, and makes it easier to predict what a driver will
   do.

 - Scandinavia has outstanding health care, sick leave, and injured
   worker's systems, so people who are not well enough to operate a
   vehicle are less likely to do so.

 - Public transport is more prevalent in Scandinavia, so that
   "amatuers" comprise a smaller percentage of vehicular traffic.

 - Scandinavians generally have more respect for the law than
   Americans do.


OK, so I lied.  Yet another post on drive drunking.

Hello all,

Many of us who still rave proudly have learned what our personal
freakout dance quota is. Many of us on this list have become selective
to the point where we seek and find the 1 event of the week we want
to support. In light of this mature rave behavior the funky techno

tribe  people have decided to be low key about the fabulous news for
this weekend in hopes that we will throw caution to the wind and not
only go to the come/unity,funky techno tribe but then be led by our
rediscovered spontenaity and head  into the park for another amazing
free bandshell experience. But as i mentioned, they know well our
party patterns and don't want us to forsake one for the other. I fully
appreciate their position, however , im a gossip and can't sit on the secret
any longer...and i am advising myself to throw caution to the wind and
go to 2 parties this weekend! (if the weather holds)

Ameba will have a tofu-kabob grand opening day party next month to 
celebrate our tea/media lounge grand opening.
 
Hawkwind was good but it took the ravers to get the crowd out of the

stupid face the stage and watch mode and start dancing with each other

Subject: no benefits
Status: 

After being advised not to get into this thread, i'm doing it anyway.  I 
want to begin with major congratulations to JSL for some honest and 
insightful postings.  I most strongly agree with the no more benefits.  Why 
do we have to denegrate everything with the idea of money, or the notion 
that we aren't accomplishing anything if we don't give money?  What comes 
next?  Maybe we can hire Jerry Lewis for a telethon so that we can really 
get publicity for our "good deeds". 

To me, there is so much more to our scene, i.e. 18+ hanging with 30+, 
people of different colors and orientation dancing together; not to mention 
the fact that very few of us know each others socio-economic standing
and are not concerned about it either.  That is what we accomplish: letting 
go of stereotypes and perhaps keeping some of those ideals when we leave a 
party; spreading those ideas with other people we meet.  

Now don't get me wrong, we should all give to charity and help where we 
can.  Go to a walk-a-thon or whatever and ask people to sponsor, but keep 
it personal.  What's more, because of the diversity of people who go to 
parties it is so unfair to believe that everyone has interest in any one 
cause; and who will chose what is "important" to everyone, after all i have 
diabetes -- why don't we have a party for that?  I type restraining orders 
for battered woman -- why can't we have a party for them, etc...  Why not 
just set up tables with information about different organizations...let 
people make decisions for themselves.  

To sum it up, the rave scene has always represented the last bastion of 
free thought, higher regard for individuality and the separation of leaders 
and followers.  Let us keep it that way.

just a quickie:

it's of course obvious by inspection that the "natural state" of the
human body is much thinner than the average bloated American.  this
may be a case of business selling back to us something which is our
natural birthright.  this is sort of an interesting contradiction, as
normally the media just trys to sell more and more and more = excess,
but in the case of fitness, they figure that they will sell more diet
aids and exercise gear, and still sell plenty of food, as Americans
are willing to shell out $$ to get thin.

i guess what i'm trying to say here is that there are non-consumer
ways of getting thin.  thinness is a more natural state than obesity.
(modulo people with chemical imbalances, of course.)  there is no
corrupt value in valuing an efficient body.

just my $0.07,
Bob

Together, 1015 Folsom.  Last Tuesday was excellent.  This Tuesday was
really good.  Cover $5.  Upstairs ultrabass funky lounge with active
ambient music.  Downstairs dark dance-o-rama.  More people last week
than this week.  Mixed crowd with probably more gays than straights
(tho i'm probably not very good at estimating, being straight).

Definitely worth checking out.  Ends around 4ish, gets going good
around 1ish.

Subject: New CDs!
Status: 


Just got back from DC and NYC where the weather sucked big-time, but
provided opportunity for fun trashbag-butt-sledding in Prospect Park.

Picked up some cool CDs at my favorite record store in NYC -- Downtown
Music Gallery (211 5th St, NY, NY).

Orb -- Live '93 -- Island Red Label -- a 2 CD set recorded at their various
concerts last year: Tokyo, Glastonbury, Copenhagen, and "Live
Orbient". Decent sound quality and good capture of the "best of tour" sound
and feel. A few parts seem to drag without the lightshow-cum-brainmachine
of the live concert experience, but for the most part, $20.00 well spent.

Divination (Ambient Dub Volume 1) -- Subharmonic Records -- Bill Laswell
takes on "ambient dub" with accompanyment by other Axiom cronies Nicky
Skopelitis, Buckethead, Robert Musso. Ranges from sounds i'd like to hear
in a rave chill room to interesting pseudo-techno.

Divination -- Dead Slow -- (Ambient Dub Volume 2) -- Subharmonic Records --
Bill Laswell takes on more "ambient dub" with accompanyment by Jah Wobble...
More ambient than volume 1.... Nice and spacy with tha boomin bass!

Latino Connection -- Charly Records -- Another entry in the "Caliente"
compilation series. This time, it's koo latin jazz ranging from Willie
Bobo, Eddie Palmieri, Art Blakey, all the way to Patti Labelle (???).

Jai Uttal -- Monkey -- Triloka Records -- I like that East Indian sound,
and for the most part, this album delivers it with a slightly too jazz
fusiony sound; I could skip the occasional english pop vocals, though. One
of them random "what the hell" purchases.

---------------------

Random used/cutout CD purchases (Downtown Music Gallery, plus Tower
"cutout" store, and Venus Records).

* Material -- Hallucination Engine ('94) -- Pretty Interesting, includes
  the already widely played "Mantra" and some interesting random "rap"
  by William S. Burroughs...

* Sly and the Family Stone -- Fresh ('73) -- Because I needed a copy of the
  funkiest song ever recorded -- "In Time"; at least half the other songs
  on this album rule!

* Best of House Music Volume 5 -- Disco Tech ('93 -- Profile) -- There
  be some serious slabs-o-cheeze here, with a few gems nestled in the
  velveeta froth. It was almost worth the $6.99 cuz it has Jump's "Luv It
  Up", Brothers Love Dubs "Ming's Incredible Disco Machine", and Son of God's
  "Harmania"....

* The Best of Rose Royce from 'Car Wash' -- this seems to be the source of a
  great number of techno, house, and rap samples. And most of their songs
  are pretty damn good too.

* Olatunji -- Drums of Passion.
* Mongo Santamaria -- Greatest Hits
* The Impressions -- Greatest Hits (cuz Curtis Mayfield Rules!)
* The Impressions -- The Young Mods' Forgotten Story (what he said!)

Cool off your automatic-response mis-understanding of racism.  Look at the
words.  They don't actualy say that the typical scandinavian is an alcoholic
or that asians are light-drinkers.  This person is talking about the typical
alcohlic of scandinavian decent or the typical light-drinker of asian decent
because there are genetic differences in people of different decents.  Racism
is discriminating or thinking less of someone because of their decent, not
acknowledging differences in culture or genetics.

Though the degree of individual freedom was far greater than ours, native
societies were not anarchic but to a small degree.  First, there were
strict governmental forms in most native societies.  Second, social pressure
was a fixed part of regulating behavior.  That there was great latitude in
individual decision-making belies these social & governmental strictures.
Some native societies were very organized and sophisticated.

I find it harder to criticize a party that is trying (or is putting on 
the appearance of trying) to support a worthy cause, than one whose only 
apparent motive seems to be profit.

I hear you there...in our promotion for KINDNESS, however, Mother Earth 
Sound System will be making the purpose of the party explicitly clear -- 
we plan to devote an entire side of the main flyer to "hemp facts"

I agree with you there as well, but the CA Hemp Init. doesn't seem to be 
receiving much support, and definitely not on the scale of those causes 
you mentioned above.

KINDESS will cost no more than $7, ideally $5 if we can manage it.

Greetings and felicitations, all!

Here are some more details on the party this coming saturday afternoon/
evening:

We will be starting promptly at 4PM.  To date, we have booked 13 DJs,
including Crunch, Phred, Jon D., Ethan, Seth, Tamotsu, Lee, M Normal,
myself :), Resonate, Giamma, Laura, and Susan of YSH.  This is almost
an exclusively SFRaves DJ list.  What an awesome collection of talent!
DJ spots are very tight, but if you have records or CDs, bring them along...
a spot just might open up.

There will be at least one live performance.  There will be two sound 
systems (possibly more).  There will be lighting and visuals.  There will
be free water (though bring your own bottles if you can).

We currently need comfy things to make the chill more hospitable.  Please
bring something if you can.

I have invitations/reminders available for anyone who would like to give 
some to friends.  We are trying to keep this party by personal invitation
only...so personally invite your friends!

I will be posting the voice mail number to this list on Friday by noon.
Please call that number after NOON on saturday for final location information.
You may also request the number by sending me personal email.  If all goes
well, we will be having a house party nigh unto the berkeley campus.  Our
backup sites are in San Francisco.  All sites are parking unfriendly, so
please car pool or plan to use public transit if at all possible.  All
sites are public transit friendly.

If you have something that you've always wanted to bring to or do at a party,
please bring it along.  This is totally a DiY effort.

As usual, this will be a free party, open to all ages, with no alcohol
served, and smoke free dance space.  We also anticipate an outdoor sound
system, so visualize clear, calm, warm weather!

Thanks!  And if you have suggestions on this or any other party we're
involved in, please let me know, and i'll do my best to help get your
suggestion integrated into the effort.

	The 303's distinctiveness does not come from its waveform complexity
	or from an abundance of features and timbres, but from one thing and
	one thing only: its internal sequencer.

	The funky, random portamento-like effect of the 303's sequencer can 
	be SIMULATED on other synths, but cannot be RE-CREATED.  

	The parameters which you are using in your judgement of the 303 are 
	irrelevant to the reason's for its fetish-like status.

	One could also make the case that any up-to-date digital synthesizer,
	such as the Yamaha SY99 or Kurzweil K2000 can outperform any outdated,
	out of production analog synthesizer.  I don't actually think this,
	of course.  :)

	I will demonstrate examples of music containing 909's and 303's,
	as well as a short live set of purely 909/303 acid (I don't know
	what else to call it :) ), albeit in a limited time space of 60 min,
	this saturday at the 2-19-94 party.

	Looks like there will be lots to choose from!  :)

	Oh by the way, are we ever going to see a smiley face in an analog
	resonate post?  Just wondering...

	See you all Saturday!

The conditions of governanace, cited above, do not  necessarily constitute
what we know know as  representative government.  They are anarchic in
fact.  To give the definition which I use, as defined by the Random House
College Dict:  A theory that  proposes the cooperative and voluntary
associations of individuals and groups as the principal mode of organized
society.

And that is precisely what most of the acient Native American/African
societies had.  Organization and sophistication are , as you well know, not
mutually exclusive to  our form of representative government.  An argument
can be made that it requires a *greater* level of sophistication to have a
society based upon anarchy, than one that is representative in nature.
Representative governments, from my view, are far less pro-active, and work
well in homogenous societies.  An anarchic model seems to work well in both
a diverse as well as homogenous since it is voluntary in nature and is not
imposed upon those who do not wish to participate (since they would be
banished if they were not in the *spirit* of the collective).

Anarchy does not mean that there is no rule, or no law.  It's just that the
members of said society would seem to have a greater say in the daily
management of a societies affairs, than what would be afforded through a
representative form of government.

Anarchy is an *ideal* model.  Too bad most are too greedy to implement it
fully, and the 1% of the power in this country would NEVER allow such a
system to take root.  Not without heavy bloodletting.

First of all, wouldn't your proposed model have to be small scale?  Its
not very practical to every day check in with millions of other americans
to see what's to be done that day.   Secondly, if it weren't small scale,
then wouldn't it need some organizing factor?  Lots of groups have in
their "constitution" that "it must never be organized", but inevitably
when that group expands a natural heirarchy develops because of the need
for organization.  These people are not "in office", but they do help lead
the group in where it wants to go.
Of course, when these leaders screw-up, other leader emerge.

You see, I used to be communist (i can hear the FBI knocking at my door),
but when I recognized it required small-scale groups and that people were
not truly altruistic, I realized it wouldn't work.  Greed is a facet of
the human heart too strong to break in anyone (and should we break it if
its going to be true communism?)

If you want an ararchic model, go form one.  No one's stopping you. 
Relocate to the mountains where no one will bother you.  The rest will opt
to stay under this government.  Unfortunately, you will find that unless
everyone volunteers for this model--every single individual--it won't work
because those selecting to stay under the established government will
enevitably dominate and enslave you.
I'm a disillusioned humanist too.  That's why I say work with what we
have, reform the government.):

There are communes in Europe that exist without government.  If you are
truly driven in this direction, seek them out.

Not really.  It all depends upon the number of people who have a common
gaol, and want to achieve it.

>Its

I do not *want* any government *checking in* on me.  The whole idea is to
decentralize, leaving people to form their own groups  and associations.
Who needs anyone to check up on them.  We are going towards a clan
structure anyway.  And I'm all with THAT.

>Secondly, if it weren't small scale,
>then wouldn't it need some organizing factor?

What organizing factor is needed other than people deciding that they have
common interest and values and wish to live beside others to accomplish the
goal of living?  That's the only factor needed.  And it is up to the clan
to make it's own rules and sets of governanace that fits their goals and
aspirations as a society.

Ok, so whats the point?  Anarchy provides for peaceful transitions of
government.  As  for leaders, it is up to the clan to decide how a leader
is chosen, if it is at all necessary.  It is not impossible for each person
in a society to have a voice.  It's just that *we* are not used to it.  All
that is required is a change in the way we think about things.  Our present
form of govt. gurantees that you will not be heard.  This sux!

I do not beleive that greed is an unbreakable cycle. It's just that it is
too difficult for the masses to give it up, or at least they perceive it as
to difficult to give up.

This is a discusiion about anarchy.  Like I said in my *first* post, I am
not an anarchist, nor do I think I am ready to become one.  That does not
mean , however, that I cannot appreciate the benfits of living under such a
system.  Being human, I can admire the intellectual value of something
without having to participate directly.

As for enslavement, this government has doen an *excellent* job enslaving
my people, then denying them the rights to exist with the majority in
harmony.  I have more to *fear* from this form of government than any other
form since it is majority rule.  And I *know* the majority/institutions (on
the whole) could give a fuck about most people of color.

Moving to the woods are out, since most people who live in the woods that I
would run into, are people who are running away from people like me
(African-American).  So that is out.  I am more than happy in doing what I
can to dismantle this system in any way possible.  That is why I like UG's,
that it why I appreciate the economy that "rave" fosters.

As for  reform of government.  Good luck.  You can't do much reform when
only 30% of the populace is votes.

I am *not* European, and have little desire to go to a region that has
spent the majority of it's time in the colonization of most of the world.
What I seek, I shall find in my own way, and in my own time.  I have every
right to dismantle this fucker as much as you have a right to participate
and reform it.  The fact is this govt. cannot stand under it's own weight.
And as people become more and more disillusioned it will be replaced.  The
constitution provides for that.
Fuck reform, take an iron ball to it, and rebuilt it right.  Decentralize
it, give individuals more rights, and use government for tasks that it is
best capable of, like building roads, and stuff like that.  The thing is
the govt. is soo big (and you seem to want it even bigger), it can't even
do the simple things well.

To close, your comments are refreshing.  Each of us has a different way of
establishing our goals.  I have nothing to lose by the dismantling of this
place, and it's old fashioned, racist, sexist, and colonialist ways.  This
place is a patriarchy that does not represent the diversity of it's
peoples, and in time, like soo many other great empires, will be replaced.
Nature dictates it.  So does history.

Pax eterna,
John

	Right, but what you don't mention is that the thinness promoted on
TV, etc, is not a healthy thin, it's a diet thin that is almost as
unhealthy as the obesity it's arguing against.  Thanks to the media, we
may have fewer obese people, but many many more anorexics and bulimics.

Definely worth the money ($25).

The implied assumption here is that people would form groups and
associations that are different from the ones that they are already
part of.  Most would probably not participate in forming anything,  
waiting instead for a leader to emerge for them to follow.

This has already happened.  The "rules and sets of governance" that
exist today evolved out of an initial state of relative anarchy (Unless
you believe that God or aliens handed early homosapiens a menu of
governmental systems to choose from).  

If we tore it all down and started over, what is is about human nature that 
is so different now that the same systems wouldn't just be recreated all 
over again?  It is true, that in the midst of the flux, societies that 
adopt governments more to your liking might form and perhaps be stable for
a few generations.  But that kind of reminds me of those survivalists out
in the mountains stockpiling weapons and canned food waiting for a nuclear 
holocaust to provide them with a world in which they can finally prosper.

AIDS/HIV "Overfunded? What? Guess I took a real long vacation and missed
out on when it started getting all the funding. Sorry, but if you look at
the breakout, you'll see how wrong you are. I don't have exact figures in
front of me, but last I saw something like 60% of the funding from the NIPA
was going to advertising the dangers of HIV to straight folks. Not that
this is a bad thing, but it really shows where the priorities are. And
local clinics still aren't getting shit. Color me biased, but it won't be
overfunded until there is a cure.

Couldn't agree more with you in regards to whales and trees, tho, I just
think there is some serious missapplication of priority to group the three
in the overfunded category.

Subject: Conclusion: Pacifica checkpoints
Status: 



After listening to the arguments about DUI checkpoints I went
ahead and called the police station to both ask a couple 
questions and express my concerns.

The first issue was that of randomness, and how do they 
determine who to pull over?  The answer was that it is based
on traffic.  If traffic is really backed up they let 
everyone through, if there is no traffic they usually go 
home.  In between that they go by a ratio of how many cars
are coming through.  If it is really slow it's about a 
1 to 3 ratio if it is a little busier it is more like 1 to 5.
The officer that I spoke with told me that it was somewhat
difficult to be discriminatory because it is so dark, they
really can't see who is driving what until the car is right
in front of them and by then they have already made up their
minds who to pull over.

An interesting note is that they are required by law to give
an "escape route".  They put up signs about a mile ahead 
announcing the checkpoint and allow people to take a back
road in order to avoid getting stopped.

My second concern was the effectiveness of these checkpoints.
If the checkpoints are to serve as a deterrent, are they
working?  They had no statistics on drunk driving incidents
before and after a checkpoint program was started in a 
community.  But the officer thought it was a good idea to 
find out if there was a change and he said he'd look into it.

Also, why so many units at the checkpoint?  Well, if they
arrest someone, they need the cars to take them to the station.
The checkpoint was manned not by local police but by the CHP,
this took care of some of my concerns about the locals picking
favorites.

All in all my conversation went well and I am less worried
about any problems that could come up.  The issue of freedom
and probable cause is still out there, but it seems that
for the time being the general consensus is on the side
of eliminating drunk driving by any means necessary.  There
will be another checkpoint this friday between Crespi and Linda 
Mar between the hours of 9pm and 2am.  The officer told me I 
could come down and watch if I wanted, what a rockin' friday
night that would be...

Also, for the record, they made four arrests that night.

Subject:  Comments RE:  A Rave Called Sharon.
Status: 

After writing the review of A Rave Called Sharon, I received many
messages asking why I paid the $20 to get in after going through so
much hassle at the door.  Well, as I said in the original review, I
was but 1 of 9 people in a group that carpooled up from San Jose.
By the time I had my first negative encounter with the security
people, over half of the party I was with had already paid and gone
in.  My choices at that point were rather limited in that I was one
of two people who drove - I wasn't about to leave the 4 people who
rode with me stranded in SF.  So, I paid the entrance fee and
attempted to make the best of the situation.

Also, I've been to other massives (including previous Sharon
parties) and had similar experiences at the door, only to have an
extremely good time once on the dance floor with my friends and
other happy ravers.   What made A Rave Called Sharon so bad was the
overcrowding.  If it had been in a bigger space or fewer people
where packed in, I probably would have had a decent time.  It was
the sum total of the experience that made it so bad.

Aside from Rocky Mullin, other people thought that a proper response
would have been to call the Fire Marshall and have the party shut
down.  Well, guess what?  I had the same thoughts...it took a whole
lot of restraint on my part to keep from doing so.  In fact, if I
had lived closer than the 45 minute drive home, I probably would
have.  The only reason why I didn't call is that I didn't want to
ruin the fun of other people at the party (if anyone was having
any).  I was very concerned about the safety of people there,
though.  However, I didn't think that it was my place to make that
decision for them.  My friends and I decided that it was not a safe
environment to be in (aside from being uncomfortable), so we left.
If you'll notice, in my review, I didn't blame someone else for the
bad experience I had.  I made the decision to pay the $20 cover
charge, just as I made the decision to leave.  In any event, I just
chocked it up for experience and decided to let as many people know
what happened as possible.  Hence the reason why I spent the time to
write a review and send it out over the net - so that other people
might benefit from my bad experience.  At the least, they'll have
more information to assess when making the decision as to whether or
not they want to go to another Sharon party.  Now, having said that,
I was rather surprised to see the following:

This strikes me as being extremely mean-spirited and egotistical,
not to mention being completely against what the rave spirit is
supposed to be about.  Comments like this would more appropriately
belong in the Top-40 club scene.  I mean really, after reading this
comment, why would ANYONE want to write about a bad experience that
they've had at a massive or any other party?  If they do, they're
just inviting you (Teresa Harris) to slam them!  Of course, I'm sure
that you have never had a negative experience of this nature.

In any event, I do appreciate the comments and support of people
like Rocky Mullin, Sean Casey, and others who replied in a positive
manner to my review and offered suggestions on how to make the scene
a better place.  I intend, and I hope others do as well, to continue
to write reviews of the events that we go to.  In that way, we'll
all have more information to base our future decisions on.

With that in mind, I know that Sanctuary is having their event this
Saturday at Club Atlantis (the same place as the Sharon rave I
went to).  I would be extremely interested in hearing from anyone
who attends this event to see if a different promoter can have a
good event in this space.


For now,

On Saturday, the pre-party becomes the main event!  Party 
Two/Nineteen/Ninety-Four was intended as a preparty for the
combined Funky Tekno Tribe/Come-Unity, but I think you should
all go to P T/N/NF, and make FTT/CU the after-party.  Look for
the after-after-party too...

MESS returns on Friday, along with Wicked; lotsa stuff Sunday
also, so don't get stuck at home!

Fact:  AIDS funding has gotten over 2 billion dollars during '92-'93.  Much
more than breast cancer, and cancer in general.  Please don't beleive the
hype of this disease.  I think that it is important, but more people die
from breast cancer than from AIDS.  More people die of cigarette smoke and
alcohol than from AIDS.  So, even though the benefits of such research
could yeild some very good dividends, it is a disease of behaviour, which
can be fought through education, and a *serious* re-consideration of
lifestyle practices.  For instance, if you do not have sex, oral, anal,
vaginal, or otherwise, it is highly unlikely you will get AIDS (unless you
get tainted blood, etc. but this is becoming even more rare since testing
has gotten better).  But many believe this is unpractical.  Whatever, I
really have no opinion as to how people should live, except to say you
cannot have your cake and eat it too when it comes to certain things.

Color me crazy, but there are other priorities that are still not adressed,
like the poor, poverty, and other social ills that have taken a back seat
to that overpoliticized disease.  But you never saw many up in arms, and
marching to aid them have you?  And it is funny how the disease has
somehow, during it's mobilzation missed out on minorities, and women.  But
that's what happens when emotions/politics get involved with disease
issues.  The many suffer to find a cure to a disease that may well be
incurable.  There are other important issues, let's not lose sight of them,
eh?

>
>Couldn't agree more with you in regards to whales and trees, tho, I just

I do not.  But to each his own.

How much spent on the homeless?
How much spent on poverty, education, toxic cleanup, cancer? (these issues
affect the BROADEST group numrically, and has much longer lasting
consequences.  Just look at the prisons if you need proof).

How much spent on AIDS: 2B - and not all of that was education (we spend
very little on ANY form of education in this country.  Unless you count the
amount we spend on incarceration which teaches plenty of people to be
better criminals).

You'd be hard pressed to find some programs as well funded as AIDS.  And
many want more?  My priorities lie with the whole, not just a segment.
AIDS should get funding, but so should other programs.  That is the jist of
what I'm saying.

the anarchic model did fine for them.  Anarchy, however, does not do well

This is Dave Barry's account of the Internet.  I thought it was pretty 
amusing...

**************************************************************

People often say to me "Dave as a professional columnist, you have a
job that requires you to process large quantities of information on
a timely basis.  Why don't you get a real haircut?"

What these people are REALLY asking, of course, is:  how am I able
to produce columns with such a high degree of accuracy, day in and
day out, 54 (!!) weeks per year?

The answer is:  I use a computer.  This enables me to be highly
efficient, Suppose, for example, that I need to fill up column space
by writing BOOGER BOOGER BOOGER BOOGER BOOGER.  To accomplish this
in the old precomputer days, I would have had to type BOOGER five
times manually.  But, now, all I have to do is type it once, then
simply hold the left-hand "mouse" button down while "dragging" the
"mouse" so that he "cursor" moves over the text that I wish to
"select"; then release the left-hand "Mouse" button to reveal the
"edit-menu"; then position the "cursor" over the "copy" command;
then click the left-hand "mouse" button, then move the "cursor" to
the point where I wish to insert the "selected" text, then click
left-hand "mouse" button; then position the "cursor" over the "edit"
heading on the "menu bar" again; then click the left-hand "mouse"
button to reveal the "edit menu"; then position the "cursor" over
the "paste" command; then click the left-hand "mouse" button four
times; and then.  as the French say, "voila!" (Literally, "My hand
hurts!")

If you need this kind of efficiency in your life, you should get a
computer.  I recommend the kind I have, which is a "DOS" computer
(DOS is an acronym, meaning "ROM").  The other major kind of
computer is the "Apple," which I do not recommend, because it is a
wuss-o-rama, New-Age computer that you basically just plug in and
use.  This means you don't get to participate in the most
entertaining aspect of computer-owning, which is trying to get the
computer to work.  This is where "DOS" really shines.  It is way
beyond normal human comprehension.

IT was invented by Bill Gates.  He is now one of the wealthiest
individuals on Earth -- wealthier than Queen Elizabeth' wealthier
even than some people who fix car transmissions -- and do you want
to know why?  Because he is the only person in the world who
understands "DOS." Every day he gets frantic calls like this:

   BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: Our entire worldwide corporate accounting
   system is paralyzed, and no matter what we type into the
   computer, it replies "WHO WANTS TO KNOW? (signed) 'DOS.'"

   BILL GATES: Ha-ha!  I mean, sounds pretty serious.

   BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: We'll give you $17 million to tells us
   how to fix it.

   BILL GATES:  OK, press the "NUM LOCK" key.

   BUSINESS EXECUTIVE:  So that's what that thing does?  Thanks,
   the check is on the way!

My current computer, in addition to "DOS," has "Windows," which is
another invention of Bill Gates, designed as a security measure to
thwart those users who are somehow able to get past "DOS." You have
to be a real stud hombre cybermuffin to handle "Windows." I have
spent countless hours trying to get my computer to perform even the
most basic data-processing functions, such as letting me play "F117
Stealth Fighter" on it.  I have personally, with my bare hands,
changed by "WIN.INI" and "CONFIG.SYS" settings.  This may not mean
much to your, but, trust me, it is a major data-processing
accomplishment.  Albert Einstein died without ever doing it.  ("Wait
a minute!" were his last words.  "It erased my equation!  It was "E"
equals something!")

I am not the only person who uses his computer mainly for the
purpose of diddling with his computer.  There are millions of
others.  I know this, because I encounter them on the Internet,
which is a giant international network of intelligent, informed
computer enthusiasts, by which I mean, "people without lives." We
don't care.  We have each other, on the Internet.  "GEEK PRIDE,"
that is our motto.  While you are destroying your mind watching the
worthless, brain-rotting drivel on TV ("Dave's World," Monday
nights, CBS, check your local listings), we on the Internet are
exchanging, freely and openly, the most uninhibited, intimate and --
yes-- shocking details about our "CONFIG.SYS" settings.

You would not believe how wrought up we get about this type of
thing, on the Internet.  I regularly connect with a computer group
that has a heated debate going on about -- I am not making this up
-- the timing of Hewlett-Packard's decision to upgrade from a 386 to
a 486 microprocessor in its Omnibook computer.  This has aroused
serious passion.  People -- some of them from other continents --
are sending snide, angry, sometimes, furious messages to each other.
I'm sure that some participants, even as we speak, are trying to
figure out if there is a way to alter their "CONFIG.SYS" settings so
that they can electronically punch their opponents in the mouth.
This debate has been raging, soap-opera-like, for months now, and I
have become addicted to it.  I tune in every day to see what the
leading characters are saying.  You probably think this is weird,
but I don't care.  I am a happy nerd in Cyberspace, where nobody can
see my haircut.

I went to Atlantis 3 or 4 weeks ago for after hours dancing (hip hop)
and I thought the space was just fine.  It wasn't nearly as crowded
as the Sharon descriptions sounded.

In a fit of procrastination I have drawn the floorplan.
Maybe this will be useful if ya haven't been to the place
before.  Regardless, I was entertained for awhile.

It is a fairly small place.
For scale, there were two pool tables along the far left wall.

Re: AIDS benefits

You have an excellent point in that many programs designed to deal with
poverty, crime, homelessness, ad nauseam are not funded adequately, and
are not successful.  But I don't think that you should write AIDS off as
overfunded, or even well-funded.  From the beginning of the epidemic, AIDS
research and programs have not even begun to approach receiving the moneys
asked for.  I realize this is typical of government programs.  But you
underestimate the importance of AIDS funding.  True, many more people die
of household accidents, car wrecks, smoking, etc. etc. than AIDS.  But the
reason money (and more money, believe it or not) is needed RIGHT NOW is
that the numbers of AIDS patients are continuing to increase exponentially.
AIDS is certainly, for the most part, preventable.  I know this well, I am
an AIDS educator.  But the problem is that not enough people follow
COMPLETELY the suggested guidelines.  And as a result, we are dealing,
year to year, with a bigger and bigger problem.  It IS something we can
stop, it IS something that requires more research and more education.  I
by no means am saying that we must hold a rave to support it.  But I am
saying that contrary to popular opinion, AIDS is still a very big problem.

I call myself an anarchist because it pulls my emotional heartstrings.

Realistically, however, its far too difficult to suddenly wean an entire
culture away from capitalist materialism, transforming it into a nation of
humanitarian anarchists.

Maybe it won't be accomplished in my lifetime, but to devote myself to a
"cause" seems bad because causes and movements diverge as time erodes ideals.

The only way to ensure purity of belief is to enstate a dogmatic system, and
dogma is one thing I shan't abide by (because it's blind to other options).

So what do I do?  Live like a Taoist!  Go with the electronic flow!

Besides, people USUALLY get what they deserve, anyways, and if this nation of
contented sops is capable of sending itself off into the abyss, then who am I
to stop the process of natural selection?  Why should I sully their carefree
minds with the stains of freedom and harmony?

Status: 

When I disputed John's original post, by stating that Native America was not
anarchic, John took a definition of anarchy relating to the voluntary
association of individuals.  My point was based on a much preferred and more
used definition, from the same dictionary, that anarchy means no gov't.

I guess this is all semantics, since John's basically saying that the early
freedom of native america has valuable lessons, but native america was in
fact quite highly organized.  Sophisticated gov'ts existed, in fact, some of
the most evolved democracies the world has seen.  Some systems, such as the
League of the Haudenosaunee, based upon the Great Law brought to the
Iroquois by the Peacemaker & Hiawatha, were very much representative gov'ts.
That no one was ever *compelled* by gov't to do anything except in the most
dire circumstances does not diminish the representative nature of such
gov't.

Freedom was absolute in native america, but it was not anarchy in the common
usage of the word.  

John is also correct in asserting that the settlers creating our gov't were
the power elite of the time.  But there was a most profound effect on this
power elite by the native systems, as well as on the general population.
Ben Franklin, for example, spent several decades studying the Iroquois
confederacy before he began formulating the Alpbany Plan of Union that led
to the Constitution.  In fact, Iroquois leaders spoke at the Albany
Convention.  It was the Iroquois who first advised the settlers that they
must unite their separate states if they wish to preserve their freedom.

In fact, the whole period of European *Enlightenment* rests partially on a
foundation of contact w/ the new world and its freedom.

In fact, the League remains a model of how different social groupings can
remain united, i.e, techno vs. hip-house.  (There, i've linked the threads.)

I sense this is not the place for this discussion, but at least i got a 
later word than John.  ?-)

experience is representative, and if AIDS can be held partially
responsible for this, the potential psychic damage to single people

Brock N. Meeks


 
Jacking in from a Non-Government Approved Encryption Port:
 
Washington, DC --  The Clinton Administration today gang raped your
privacy.
 
The White House Friday announced its endorsement of a sweeping new
security and privacy initiative.  Privacy, as we know it, will
never be the same. All the rules have changed.  Forever.  The catch
is that the government gets to write all the rules;  you get no
vote.  None.  Worse, you can't even read the fucking rule book
because it's classified.
 
The initiative involves the creation of "new products to accelerate
the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications
networks and wireless telecommunications links," the White House
said.  In English:  Law enforcement and intelligence agencies now
have an easy way to fuck with any and all forms of spoken or
electronically transmitted communications.
 
The policy is voluntary, of course.  You don't have to sign on to
it.  You don't have to use government approved encryption devices.
But if you plan to do any business with the government, you'll have
to use them.  And if the government gets its way, well, you'll end
using them whether you want to or not.  You'll have no choice (are
you sensing a trend here?). All telephones, computers, fax
machines, modems, etc. will come "wiretap ready."  It will be the
de facto standard.
 
If you don't use the government standard, you'll be branding
yourself a CryptoRebel.  Big fucking deal?  Maybe, maybe not.  But
think for a second. Perhaps some agency will be able to check your
"crypto-approval rating." Perhaps those favorable bank loans,
mortgage rates or low insurance premiums will only go to those with
high crypto-approval ratings.
 
But the White House is adamant about making sure you understand
this whole damn thing is voluntary.  And don't let anything sway
you from believing that, not even the White House backgrounder
materials that say no U.S. citizen "as a matter of right, is
entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product."
 
Just use the "balanced" approach of the government system, where in
this case the "breakability" of the encryption belongs only with
them. Everything will work out fine.  Just listen:  "Encryption is
a law and order issue since it can be use by criminals to thwart
wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution," said Vice President
Gore.  "Our policy is designed to provide better encryption to
individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law
enforcement and national security are met."
 
The Administration won't tell you exactly why they expect you
simply hand over all your privacy safeguards to them.  "Listen, if
you knew what we knew about criminal activity, this issue wouldn't
even be debated," said Mike Nelson with the Office of Science and
Technology Policy and co-chair of the Working Group on Data
Security, a newly created interagency task force.
 
Chicken or the Egg?
==================
 
The new policy was hatched in the super-secret recesses of the
National Security Agency (NSA).  And while Clinton was still trying
to find the instruction manual for his White House telephone
system, the NSA, FBI and other assorted agencies shoved their ideas
onto the National Security Council table.  Before the
Administration could blink, it found itself in the unenviable
position of having backed a severely flawed security policy that
has compromised the privacy of every U.S. citizen and drawn the ire
of every civil liberties in the country.
 
But the White House quickly put the breaks on, calling for a full
scale, government wide "review" of its security and privacy
policies. It gave privacy advocacy groups some breathing room. 
Surely the Administration, once it had a chance to actually study
this damn thing, would see it through it.
 
But the White House punted.  The review was a smoke screen. 
Instead, it provided momentum inside the Administration.  It was
from this review, ordered last April, that this new initiative
springs.
 
And when all was said and done, the White House screwed the pooch.
 
Clipper Sails On
================
 
The one trick pony here is the Clipper Chip, a device that can be
installed in virtually any communications device. The chip
scrambles all conversations.  No one can crack the code, expect the
government, of course.  The Feds hold all the keys. Rather, they
hold the only keys that count.
 
Each Clipper chip is made with 3 unique keys.  All three are needed
to descramble the encrypted messages streaming through them.  But
only the government's keys matter.  The key you get with your
Clipper Chip is essentially the chip's social security number. 
You'll never actually see this key, have any idea what its number
is or get your hands on it. If you try to sneak a peak at it, the
damn thing self destructs. Honest.
 
The other two keys will be held in electronic vaults;  fraternal
twins, separated by mandate.  Each of these keys will be held by
government agencies, called "escrow agents."  One will be held by
the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the other by
the Automated Systems Division of the Dept. of Treasury.
 
When a law enforcement agency, which could be your local sheriff's
department, wants to wiretap a conversation that's been encrypted
by Clipper they apply to each of the escrow agents.  The agents
send their respective key, electronically, to a "black box"
operated by the law enforcement agency.  As encrypted conversations
stream into the box, they come out the back side in nice, neat
sounding vowels and consonants, or in the case of electronic mail,
in plain ol' ASCII.
 
Yes, all law enforcement agencies need a court approved wiretap
before they can pull this whole scheme off.  This, the
Administration says, is where you're privacy is protected.  "We're
not going to use Clipper to listen in on the American public," said
Raymond Kammer of NIST deputy director.  It will only be used to
catch criminals.  Honest.
 
We Don't Need No Stinkin' Warrant
=================================
 
Maybe now would be a good time to mention the National Security
Agency. You know these guys.  Super-secret, spook agency.  Their
mission?  To monitor and intercept foreign communications.  Did you
catch that word FOREIGN?  I hope so, it's crucial.
 
The NSA is only allowed to intercept foreign communications --
spying on U.S. citizens is a crime.  They can't even pry into a
U.S. citizen's business a court ordered wiretap.  A judge would
never allow it.  Yet it was the NSA that cooked up this whole
Clipper Chip scheme.  Why you ask? Good question. But the
Administration refuses to discuss the issue.
 
Here's another they can't answer.  Suppose the NSA intercepts a
message from Iraq and finds it's Clipper encrypted (that damn
little black box is specially made to sniff out the Clipper's
algorithm and descramble it's social security number).  What does
the NSA do with this encrypted Iraqi message? How does it decrypt
the message? There's a classic Catch-22 running here.
 
Agencies need the Clipper keys from the escrow agents to read the
message or listen in on the conversation.  But to get the keys you
need proof that you have a warrant.  The NSA is *never* issued a
warrant.  You see, the NSA doesn't need a warrant to spy on FOREIGN
communications.
 
So, this begs the $64,000 question is:  How does the NSA get the
escrow agents to give them the keys to decrypt the message if they
can't show a warrant?
 
Answer:  They don't have to show a warrant;  they don't have to
cause; they don't have to show spit.
 
What's wrong with this picture?
 
"We have appropriate procedures and safeguards built into the
system for the NSA," Nelson said.  "I can't tell you what those
are, of course, that would divulging too much about the NSA's
operation."
 
Fox Guarding the Chickens
=========================
 
There will be absolutely no abuse of the system.  This is what the
Administration would like you to believe.  They also would like you
to believe that President's don't approve Watergate break-ins, that
arms are never traded for hostages, that the FBI never secretly
records civil rights leaders in the heat of infidelity and that FBI
directors have never shown a proclivity for red sequined dresses
and shiny high-heeled cruel shoes.
 
Representatives from four government organizations stood before the
press and outlined all the careful thinking and rigorous safeguards
that have gone into this system.  There are at least 9 different
steps that must be followed to get these Clipper keys transferred
from the escrow agents to the agency authorized to do the wiretap.
 
Fair enough, isn't it?  Well, it would be except for the fact that
the Justice Department intentionally wrote a giant fucking loop-
hole into the law.
 
Buried in the Justice Department briefing papers, outlining the
authorization procedures for release of the escrow keys, is this
gem: "These procedures do not create, and are not intended to
create, any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through
electronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures
shall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other
objection to the introduction of electronic surveillance evidence
lawfully acquired."
 
So, if somebody screws up, like for instance, asks for the keys to
be sent before they actually have a wiretap in hand, or has no
wiretap authority at all! there is no recourse provision.
 
Criminals As Dumb Shits
=======================
 
But what about that wily criminal element?  Once they get wind of
this, won't they seek out another type of encryption?  The FBI
doesn't think so. In fact, the FBI thinks criminals are such dumb
shits that they'll forget all about the fact that Clipper even
exists.
 
"I predict that few criminals will remember years from now what
they've read in the Wall Street Journal" about how these devices
were installed in telephones, said FBI's James Kallestrom.  (Of
course, if criminals are so stupid, why are they perusing the Wall
St. Journal... maybe he really meant the New York Times...)
 
So let's get this right.  The FBI is sure that criminals will "just
forget" that Clipper is installed in their phones and use them
anyway.  These are the criminals that also would be forgetting that
their multi-million dollar drug deals, not to mention their own
sweet ass, could be in jeopardy every time they make a call.  Yes,
the government really thinks so.
 
It's more likely that some bright, enterprising criminal mind will
create a worldwide black market that deals in "non-Clipper
Installed" encryption devices.  Damn, talk about an industry with
some growth potential.
 
Getting To the Data Stream
==========================
 
The whole damn program goes into the crapper, however, if the
government can't get access to source, to the digital data stream,
as it comes out of the telephone switch.  In order to do this you
have to tap the digital conversation.  That's right, you guessed
it: Digital Wiretap Access.
 
The FBI failed on its own last year to generate any support in
Congress for this digital wiretap proposal.   Hell, the FBI
couldn't even get a single member of Congress to introduce the
thing.  So the FBI broke the chain of command: They got the
President and Vice President to sign off on the idea.
 
The Administration will soon announce its decision on how it will
give the FBI the right to easily wiretap even your unencrypted
conversations. "Within a few months at most we should have
something decided," said Barry Smith of the FBI's Congressional
Affairs office.  The FBI's Kallestrom said it was "all but a done
deal."
 
This isn't a question of whether or not the Administration will
line up behind the FBI on this.  It already has.  It's only a
matter of paperwork, and the nagging little issue of how to pay for
making the telephone companies comply with the new rules.  But
these are small details, compared to the heat the Administration
already knows it'll take when they finally unwrap this puppy.
 
Private No More
===============
 
OSTP's Nelson quipped that these security and privacy issues are
the Cyberspace version of the Administration's muddied Bosnia
policy.
 
Like Bosnia, the White House expects the American public to "trust
us" on this issue.  After all, the Administration says, they know
a hell of a lot more than we do about what kind criminal activity
is really going down.
 
Trusting these law enforcement and intelligence agencies is one

So, if you're really pissed off, just pick up the phone can call

hello all you sfravers...

it's been a long time since I last posted and it's been a long time
since I last saw most of you.  I can't post this myself because I'm
not subscribed so brian is doing it for me, since he's such a nice
person (but we knew that long ago =).  the reason I'm mailing this 
is, well... 

I was just rummaging through some old files on my soda account and I
came across a collection of posts regarding last year's february fmr.
I read the somewhat lengthy post I made (some things never change...)
and all the replies and comments from everyone else.  it made me a
little nostalgic and more than a little sad.  I really miss raving, or
at least what it used to mean to me.  I miss the family I had there -
there people I met when I went out, the virtual family of sf, ne, mw,
and se-ravers... so much of raving was shallow and pretentious and
petty... but this made all the true happiness, the true friendships,
the real energy and love all the more precious.  the way I felt at
the feb fmr could never be exactly replicated - too much has changed
in my life, in other people's lives, in raving, in the world.  what
is truly wonderful, though, is knowing that it is entirely possible
to reach a state of such happiness and freedom.  thank you all for
helping to make it possible... I miss it all quite a lot.

the feb fmr happened just over a year ago... hopefully, today, I'll
get to see a lot of you - if you can make it over here to the east
bay.  most of you will probably get this after I see you but I wanted
to write when some of these thoughts were fresh.  this letter isn't
complete, there's so much more I'd love to tell you all, but this
is enough, for now.  I miss you all and I hope to see you soon...

love to everyone...

always, leah

ps - if you want to send a reply to the list, please cc a copy to me...
thanks

of course there is a hell of a lot of irony in the picture

a similar type of event as is in the picture (hopefully not like the real one)

its really funny that i just got leahs post right before posting this though
cuz it kinda did the same things for me
(of course leah probably wouldnt recognize the picture considering
she was such a wild partier that nite :)

ALthough, that wasnt all that great a party, it was a hell of a fun

what can i say, another house party for the sfraves crew. it was really 
good.  three rooms of music..2 dance rooms, though in the being of one it 
was ambient, and the other a live music room. 

all the djs were great (i moved around a lot) there was a lot  of music, 
but people didnt spin that long due to the time restraints. it was great 
seeing everyone, the toys provided were great, good smart drinks, 
etc. too bad it was raining!  

i had fun with the weird blinking lights crew -i think i should practice 
before standing in an inprovisational music arrangement, or at least know 
how to use the equiptment.:)

the funniest thing of the evening was that when we were setting up in one 
of the rooms upstairs, there was a $20 bill in a jar near the window. It 
was counterfeit, but when I returned to see if that bill was still there, 
it was gone. c'est la vie. so count that one as a lost and found item. :)

thank you for seth for the place, bryce and ethan yet organizing another 
party, all the djs, etc.

hopefully brian will be there next time, right bri??

Before I get any more thank you's for opening up my place for 2/19/94, 
let me just say thank YOU all for coming!  Yes, you! Without the people, 
a party is nothing more an empty space.  Thanks to everyone who helped 
out, especially Bryce, who was the glue holding the whole thing 
together.  

And a special thanks to all who brought visual stimulation!  We had lots 
to look at, including Dreamachines, blacklighted rainbow slinkies hanging 
from the ceiling, and a great lighting fixture in the hall upstairs.

Despite the furious downpour on what was originally planned to be a 
roof-based party, we managed to go off once again!!  I look forward to 
many more great SFR parties in the future.  Hopefully we'll be able to 
use this damn roof someday :)

Thanks again to all,

Seth

 Right off , let me thank Seth and his housemates ( and his co-op ) 
for allowing this party at this space. Also , thanks to Bryce for
coordinating all the players and getting it done. 

 --------------------

 I had an omen that the party would turn out right for me when I was 
able to find parking a half-block from the apartment. The party itself
fullfilled my expectations and more !

 Such a choice of music! And , besides the regular SFRaves djs , there
was some folks manning the mixers that I had never seen do it before -
Giamma on the CD mixer , Allen@Ameba upstairs , a YSH dj ( whose name 
excapes me at this time ) , and , as the first dj downstairs , Capt.
Crunch! 

 I liked to duck into the live music room every once and awhile , to
let my mind do some dancing while my body rested. A nod to resonate &
Weird Blinking Lights for the setup.

 Summary : Excellent!

 --------------------

 BTW: I think that having it on the roof wouldn't work - there was one 
noise complaint with it indoors and muffled by the rain , so having the
music out in the open might not be a good idea. ( Of course , maybe 
the non-music area was meant to be on the roof , reserving the 
main room for more dance area [?] ).

 ?: I wore out my legs at the party , and went home instead of continuing
on to Funky Techno Tribe at Caeser's . How was it?

Hi folks,

been a while since i've posted, but i just HAVE to tell you
some probably-only-interesting-to-me synchronous events.

OK, so i'm enjoying this rave thing. I go to the NASA tour,
and outside before the show i chat with a guy named Erik from
SPIN magazine.  We talk mostly about the net.views, including
alt.rave, sfraves, vrave. And of course the recent MOBY posts - 
told him about the 'FUCKING ANAL-RETENTIVES .... EMERSON-LAKE&PALMER
RECORDS' quote that i found quite amusing.

Then great fortune hits, and i get to go to SanFran for a weekend.
Fortune strikes again - captain crunch offers to take me with him to 
a rave. And one more strike o' luck - sfraves Friends&Family party
was that weekend, where i got to meet LOTS of fine people, including
one Laura La Gassa.

So fucking what, you ask. So i get a copy of SPIN with the review of
the NASA tour. (RoadWarriors was the title). It starts in Denver, and
includes comments about the net and the Moby quote (unattributed, so
you just have to take my word on our conversation). It ends in SF, and 
cites captain crunch as one of the noteable attendees. Pretty cool, i
think to m'self.

Then, this weekend i go raving and pick up a flyer - Guess what - 
Laura LaGassa is coming here! In March! An all-female DJ thing.

take care, you fine people

In-Reply-To: phred@well.sf.ca.us -- 02/21/94 16:36

so i went raving two nights in a row for the first time in quite some time.
i guess i have not really experienced terrybly good raves lately. son anyway,
on sat. went our sfr party, 2/19/94 and really enjoyed. good atmoshpere,
GREAT toys downstairs, cool music.  a good pre-rave warm. the afterwards,
kathryn and i headed to caesar's latin palace. i remember talking to people
and i felt a certain apprhension on several people's part. why ? ok, so it
is in a rather unsafe part of town, but so ? it was a really good party.
i had a very interesting, um, trip there and back :) and met some really
interesting folx from arizona, michael and sloane, as well as george
from oaktown ( is this right, kathryn ?) .anyway, it was a definite
recinnecting -type experience, and even the (pseudo)-gangsta presence
did not diminish it ( pseudo according to phred; he claims that seattle
has the gang-banger type folx/worriors show up at raves, while the folx at
caesar's were more 'wanna-be.' on this i guess i defer to his judgment).
if anything, it was an interesting if a bit scary experinece trying to connect
to these folx in trust , not fear . for me, i felt it SORTA worked. the
music was really good and the vibe was definitely in the house, positive,
supportive. caesar's was totally packed and there was a very good mix of folx,
some from the barrio, some from farther away, some new to this raving thing,
some 'veterans,' some young ,some old, tho' more were young. a good party.
there was one scuffle, but the security were very much on the ball, and
intervened immediately and so the vibe was not disturbed that much. it
felt great when the party ended at 7 am and we were all together, seeing
each other at the end of our ,um experience. it seemed that caesar himself
was on had, and i thanked personally an older gentlman whowas asking to leave
for havin gus in his place. he seemd actually rather pleased by the whole
thing!  the $20 price was a bit hi . anyway,
on sun. i rested a bit and then showed sloane and michael sf a bit, tho'
they had been here before. later, phred and i went to kennel club -phred
wanted to see/hear some world beat- and then off to spundae's 1yr b-day
party. there was  a huge line toget in, but once there it was quite good.
ok, so it was clubby, but the music was quite good and there WERE 3 rooms,
1 upstairs, 2 down, with various flavours house, a bit o' techno . the
crowd was pretty friendly, but it did get rather crowded. trhe price, $10,
was just right. it ended at 8 am, and it felt good, tho' not great.
take care/shalom/(b)rave it out

SF Rave report 
==============

This weekend was much different for me.    I guess I'll start off by
reporting on the SPAZ Wednesday rave at 60 6th St in SF.    This 
neighborhood is the sleaziest part of town,   but the venue was a
small bar and dance hall.    I had a difficult time trying to get
ice,  and they even charged for water.    It seemed that the bars
only interest was to make money anyway they can,   but I was able 
to find the promoter and express my concern.   I WAS even going to
purchase a drink,  instead I popped over to the corner store and
bought my drink from there to avoid the geedyness of the bartender.

The music was totally awsome.   Really trancey house music,   hardly
any vocal,  lots of synthesizer stuff.    Really new and refreshing when
compared with the big name DJ's record collection that I've heard all too
often.    Never missed a beat....  Danced almost all the time,  except
to go out and chill.

The only bad part is that the place closed at 2 am (yukk!!),   too bad
because the bar couldn't sell alcohol after that.     

On Friday,  I went to the WELL party,  at the Presidio Yaght club,  and
abstained from raving.    The WELL (well.sf.ca.us),  is a major Internet
accessable public on-line system,  origionally serving the bay area since
1984.    It's been a long time since I've chatted to the WELL folks,  so
we really had a great time.  Met a few ravers there as well.

This saturday was yet another very small SFRave party from 4 pm till 11 pm
in Berkeley.   Mostly attended by the small gathering of dedicated Internet
ravers from the sfraves mailing list.

I was scheduled to spin at 4 pm (Going on first).   Thanx to the generious
donation of records from Ir-dial of the UK,   I had a chance for the very
first time to introduce this great music to the SF area.    Some of which
was heard for the very first time.    I want to thank those folks in the UK
for sending them to me.    I had plenty of material to put forth good housey
tunes and didn't miss a beat for an entire hour.    Each DJ had an hour
to spin,  and 2 places were set up,  with a 3rd place housing a MIDI system
churning out some GREAT Ambient tunes.

After the party,   I was still rather tweaked out,  and decided to try and
get some food before heading over to Funkey Techno Tribe,  which I've heard
was to take place in the Cesars Theator in the Mission district (Not a very
nice area of town).   We finally get over there at 2 am,   but the lines were
so long and slow,   that we had second thoughts about going in.   It was
a Malachy benefit and NO guest lists,  and was a very steep $20.   So,
because we only would have had 4 hours of dancing before Cesars closed at
6 am,   my other two friends with me decided that it just wasn't worth the
steep $20 to attend,  so we headed back over the Golden Gate into Marin and
chilled out,  did yoga,   and eventually crashed,  with a vow to definately
make the Spundae 1-year anniversary party.    The other party (Sanctuary)
was also a rip-off $20 and rumors were that it was at Atlantis (Same place
as the Sharon rave last week that got such a poor review).

Spundae - WOW!!   For a Sunday evening,  it was just as crowded as the
Sat evening mega raves.    Only regrets I had was that the promoters
failed to mention that we were to bring a canned food item and get $5
knocked off the $10 price.    So we popped over to the all-night Quick
stop and grabbed the last two canned food items they had.  That evening,
it was reported they had a run on all sorts of canned food items,  and
the store clerk was surprised at the brisk sales.   We finally work our
way into the front of the line,   and they had 3 dance areas,  all playing
good funkey tunes and everyone having a great time.    I was in one of the
smaller less crowded areas,  when Aaron came up to me and said "DubTribe
is kicking some great tunes in the back area",  so I leave to discover
yet new great tunes coming forth that kept be whizzing around the dance
floor totally zoned out.   I didn't even notice when DubTribe finished
their live set,  as the DJ coming on,  beat matched to DubTribe perfectly
and I had been dancing there for at least an hour before I realized that
they were done.

I eventually left that area,  and checked out the main room,  where yet
more great funkey sounds were bouncing me around the floor.  

Spundae is normally held at DV8 lounge,  a great space,  plenty of cool
air and ventilation,  chill out opportunities,   and I had found a great
dancing spot next to an air conditioning vent that kept me out there
for almost 3 hours solid non-stop.   My knee is healing pretty good,  
now,  so I'm getting back to my usual aggresive style.   

I almost forgot as 7 am approached,  that I had to move my car before
the parking meters get enforced,   but curious as to how much longer
it lasted.    Really good vibes,   lots of "Old Schoolers" and the folks
out there returned lots of smiles and joy.   I'll remember this one for
a long time....   Good vibes,  Great and well ventilated venue,  large
dance area,  great chill out,  free water.. and only $5 to get in if
you bring a canned food item (for the needy).   I would have to give 
Spundae an 8 or a 9,  on a 1-10 scale,  and the DTCT 
(Dance time Vs Chill Time) factor approaching 98%.

Now,  to post this....   Till next time.... Keep the scene alive!!

Subject: A direct inet line to your home.. vrave terminals at sfraves events..
Status: 

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

	This is something that I've decided to do, and we have to get
working on things, quickly.

	Check it out-- if you're interesting joining this thing, mail
me, and we'll talk. (sameer@soda.berkeley.edu)

	The idea at this point is to get a place in June, and then get
our net link maybe in the fall or winter sometime. (We'll likely have
a SLIP link starting in June.)
	If you're not a hacker/tech/geek/etc. -- don't worry. Read
through this and if you think there's something you can contribute, we
can talk.

	The name "NEXUS-Berkeley" *really* needs some improvement. We
haven't thought of a good replacement yet.

	(This is still a draft..)

1) Introduction
	What's the NEXUS-Berkeley Project all about? It's a lot.

	There are goals, and there are dreams.

	Most of all though, we're optimistic. We know we can do it.

	So, then.. what are we doing?

	We're hardwiring the Gaia Consciousness.

	In other words. A bunch of people who want high-quality net
access to their home are getting together, pooling funds, so that they
can do it. That's us, the NEXUS-Berkeley folk.
	Our plan right now is pretty simple. We're going to find a
place in Berkeley to move into. Thus we all have to work on how a
bunch of net-fiends like ourselves can live together.
	Then we're going to get a dedicated line to the internet, and
connect it to out home network of computers. I'd like to see a
terminal in the kitchen, the bathroom, a few in the living room, and
personal privately owned machines in each individual's bedroom. All
this hardware will be wired together into a local network, which is
then connected to the internet, via a dedicated line of some sort.
	Then we're going to start moving towards self-sufficiency--
providing internet services to the local community to bring in income.
Minimally, the net-link should be paid for by our income. Ideally,
we'll have enough income to pay the rent.
	The first step is shell accounts, sold cheaply. We can't
compete with the giants, netcom, crl, etc. We will provide a service
along with the shell accounts that won't be found at the giants-- a
community-oriented personalized approach. We want to build a community
around this thing. We'll have a local BBS, monthly meetings, internet
tutorials, and maybe even parties, where the attendants can take a
break from dancing and log into vrave.
	We don't want just tech-folk, though. We want BALANCE. We need
writers, artists, teachers, techies.. If you have a talent, it's
likely that the NEXUS could put it to good use. We need teachers to
run the tutorials. Artists to make flyers and decorate the place.
Writers to write press releases and other written work. Sociologists
to study us and keep us from killing each other.

2) Technical issues
 A) The link

	We have a bunch of options for the link. For startup we can
probably only afford at 56k line. There's a few choices in that
regard. We can go with The Little Garden, a cooperative, whom Sameer
would very much like to deal with, because of the cooperative nature
of it all.
	There's Internex-- they provide ISDN, which is high-bandwidth,
but right now ISDN runs .01/minute. If ISDN ever goes to untimed
service it would be excellent, but I'm not counting on it.
	There's sharing 5 SLIP lines with another site, which has the
benefit of cost, and a max-throughput of 56k, but it's sharing it with
another site, which has its obvious drawbacks.
	  If we want to resell the link 56k can only last so long. T1
is an inevitable situation. We will probably end up with an overbooked
T1 [The Little Garden] and move up from there (time and money will
tell) The provider is also quite up in the air. We can't be positive
who we will want to deal with.  Demand exceeds supply, so finding a
provider who is civil and non-anal retentive about usage could be a
chore. (Sprintlink seems like a good option.)

 B) The computers and hardware
	We'll need a main computer (or cluster, depending on how much
CPU-power we need) which is owned by the group, some terminals, (bad
ones for the kitchen & bathroom, but good ones for the living room) a
router, and a CSU/DSU pair. Individual resident members should use
privately-owned computers for their rooms.
	I'd like to have it set up so that there's a main NFS-mounted
filesystem with most stuff, email, news, general files, but each
individual's private computer is very isolated and paranoid about
security, where they can store sensitive things such as PGP private
keys. CFS can also be installed on the personal workstations, so that
private computers need not have that much local drive space, while
preserving privacy.
	  The main choices of processors seem to be quite numerous. We
have pretty much ruled out intel processors at this point. Sun and DEC
seem to hold the most promise for servers.  We have to learn a lot
more about machines before deciding what will suit our needs. We can
get something used.
	  What kind of ethernet are we going to use? How fast will it
be? What vendor?

 C) Machine Speed/Upgrades
	We will constantly be wondering exatcly where our income will
be best spent. Trying to make sure all of the hardware we have is up
to the task is going to be a royal pain. Each upgrade brings new
problems and exposes new bottlenecks.
	  A vitally important factor is machine speed. People hate
waiting 30 sec to a min for their mail or news to index or for a
program to start. This gets people complaining fast.
	Batch processing: For incoming mail and news, we can deal with
slower machines here, but we will need power news and mail get backed
up at another site and we get hit with a deluge all in one day (this
happens more than you may think)
	We should probably allow users to use 5 megs of diskspace with
maybe a one dollar per meg per month charge for diskspace used over
five megs.  We need need to know this before we know how much HD space
to buy.

 D) Dialups 
	This is a HUGE pain in the ass. The system Aron currently on
staff for (eskimo.com) has a basic policy of 90% free. Meaning 90% of
the time you get through on the first try. This has worked out to 13
users per dialup. We will likely find something similar. Optimally I
would like to see around 10 per dialup, but resources will again be a
factor.

 E) Miscellaneous Services
	Games: Something where the user has a graphic client at home
and uses our machines to communicate with other users in the same
general area or around the world I know DOOM can be played on
networks.  It would be interesting to talk with id software and see
what we can hack together.


3) Social issues
 A) Residents
	We have to decide how many resident members we want. They all
have to be pretty compatible in living style, as well. It seems that
5-10 would work out pretty well, with seven as the ideal.  We also
need *balance*. We need techs, artists, writers, teachers, and more
sorts to round out the local community. A household full of
tech/hacker/geek-types won't be well-rounded enough for my tastes.
(Well all be net-fiends, though, of course.)
	  Residents will be those that can make a healthy commitment
of time and money to the nexus. Time and a desire to work are
*clearly* more important than the size of your monetary
contribution. We will however need a decent amount of capital to get
the ball rolling. All types of people need apply. We have enough
people to run the tech end of things even now (though we would like a
few more).
 	  We intend to try living together for a month or 3 to iron
out the kinks before sinking our hard won cash into a ton of
equipment. There are a ton of horrible nasty issues that have to be
worked out before we can even THINK of doing this seriously.

 B) Local community
	We can set up a BBS to serve everyone in the community, to
help foster the community-oriented aspects. Sameer thinks that the
local discussions groups should be accesible ONLY via the BBS
(hopefully we can find a good free BBS system for UNIX) because
there's an entirely different feeling when accessing something via a
usenet newsreader than a BBS interface.
	We want people logging into the BBS (if they want to login
directly to a shell that is cool too) as the default. Something that
is intuitive and user friendly. Something that encourages
communication between our customers. Encourages them to make their own
spaces within the BBS (various conferences or groups-- it should be
trivial for a user to start his or her own local group). We should
encourage people use the machines for thier projects and interests --
hopefully things we haven't even conceived.
  It is important to get the users as involved in the bbs as
possible. Aron has noticed that people will put up with a lot of crap
if you tell them *why* it is happening and *what* is being done to fix
it. Encourge folks to build a place where they will feel comfortable.
	Once again the community aspect of the bbs is key, it is the
only thing we will be able to offer folks that crl and netcom
can't. Although I do not want to do this at the expense of
performance, community is something that we can only work to foster;
if we pull it off will not cost us anything in the way of money.
	  Although 95% of all muds are complete shit there are a
select few that are very much worth playing.  They also do a ton for a
community vibe (at least some of them do) This is another thing that
can start small (depending on resources) and grow to hugeness.

  C) Nexus Fissioning
	  These are basically the issues of nexi fissoning, or ouside
parties with the recources to do so "glomming on". Most of this can be
addressed at a later date.

  D) Meetings
	User meetings are key. We nned to be able to meet these folks
face to face and show them that we are in fact real folks. It makes
people feel better about the service and enhances the community
vibe. Aron would suggest monthly meetings. Sunday afternoons are
usually the best time. A place like a pizza joint usually has no
problem with this since they get little buisness on sunday
afternoons. Also that is the time most people will be able to make a
meeting. Before Aron left Seattle eskimo was getting between 20-30
folks a month sometimes as many as 50. He's sure it has swelled since
eskimo's subscriber base has exploded.

4) Economic issues
 A) Incorporation
	We should get an EIN, and a bank account, and all that good
stuff, but the question is whether or not we should incorporate as a
non-profit?
	  It has been mentioned that the "safest" way for us to go
about organising as a buisness is to organise as a corperation. This
protects us from being sued as individuals and has tons of other nice
benefits-- limited liability. There are also numerous reasons we would
like a corporation for tax reasons, because by moving personal
expenses to corporate expenses we can get bigger tax writeoffs.

 B) Incomes for residents
	At the outset everyone will need day jobs.

 C) Self-sufficiency
	Once the nexus becomes self-sufficient (I'm optimistic)
dealing with new arrivals/departures will get VERY interesting.

 D) Shell accounts for the community
	We can provide dialup access to the net, and our edge on the
big providers will be the niche market I've been talking about. The
community-oriented approach will give us our market. I'd like it to be
sorta like the well but less expensive, and less elitist. Monthly
meetings for users, occasional parties, and the like will build a
strong commitment between the nexus and the dialup members.
	A good pricing structure could be $15/month, $30/quarter, and
$90/year.

  F) Anonymous crypto services


5) Projects
	Projects will be what gives us noteriety in the E and RL
communities. They will also be a major source of income (depending on
the nature of the project obviously). Hopefully, they will also be a
hell of a lot of fun. We need any and all ideas for more project
areas.
	People who joined the NEXUS-Berkeley will have to decide for
themselves how they can contribute using their own particular skills,
in their own project. Thus before anyone joins the NEXUS-Berkeley an
individual should write up an informal "Project Proposal" such that
their commitment is made firm and we know how they'll be able to help.
	We will be writing up a "Request for Projects" and posting it
among various newsgroups, so that interested people may join us if
they so desire.

  A) Programming

	Being a mostly E oriented group (although not totally E, but
that will be the focal point and that which brings us together, a
facilitator if you will) we will most likely have tons of programming
projects going. Some of which will relate directly to the BBS, others
which may have uses to a variety of people. Writing free software for
net distribution and the like. The majority of the things below are
just ideas I am throwing at you. Feel free to pick them up and run or
add your own.


  B) AI
	This is an interest of Aron's and he would like to work on
various things in this area.

  C) Graphics

	Eye candy anyone? SGI or Amiga kinda stuff here, Dunno how we
can turn it into money though I *know* there are many ways. We could
possibly offer the basic scanning and manipulation services in order
to help pay for the workstations and other assorted equipment.

  D) Cryptography
	Sameer is very interested in implementing and developing
cryptographic and anonymity tools through the Nexus for fun &
profit. There is a good deal that we can do, including pay for use
anonymous remailing services, anonymous IP forwarding (IP laundry) TCP
in UDP tunnelling so that nomads can have TCP/IP connectivity
whereever they have a telnet dialup.
	Each of these schemes can bring in a good sum of money, if
arranged properly

  E) Operating Systems
	Have you ever been 100% satisfied with the OS you were using?
Although the manpower (ok personpower) for such a massive undertaking
would not come solely from the Nexus.
	I do not see why it could not be a focal point for
development. There is a ton of public domain code to start with and
build on. I would favor a microkernel UNIX variant. We could offer
free accounts to other folks who are willing to do coding (up to a
reasonable level). We could offer a full blown killer OS for the price
of Windows or System 7. Aron fully realizes this is one of his "lofty"
goals, but he would love to see it happen.

  F) Zines
	Chris Blosser has expressed his desire to publish a 'zine for
his contribution to the project. It would be a wonderful form of
community building, including merely public relations all the way to
contributions from subscribers to the various services which we will
sell.

  G) Music
	Making money in that buiness?  If we had the space (correctly
zoned of course) we could put on shows of various types, showcase
slightly obscure bands, and make some money in the process. There is
quite a bit of shit to consider insurance and crap.
	We could incorporate the net into our music making-- some
intercity/international collaborative music-making would be an
excellent project. This could be incorporated into collaborative
artwork as well, similar to things such as the OTIS Project.
	

  H) Raves & Parties
	As for a raves and rave like parties, these are other things
we can do (both free and for profit though if anyone wants to throw a
$20 event we will kill them) We have a few folks who are knowledgeable
about what to do here.
	It would be really great to put on parties at which we have
terminals available, either logged into vrave or connected with other
Nexus-homes across the world each of them holding parties at the same
time, so that international parties can be arranged. Sameer has
mentioned this idea to many people and they are very interested-- this
seems a great way of getting people interested in becoming members or
simply attending our parties.  
	Of course there are concerns about securing the equipment and
noise in the neigborhood. And numbers of people.  This is a great idea
for community building.
	Do we even let folks know where the house is? All these
party ideas are great, but do we really want a ton of people we don't
know, knowing that we have 100 grand worth of equipment in our house?
Security is a big issue here, as well as the fact that we may not have
enough room to pull shit like this off. This is definetly something
that needs to be hashed out.

  I) Testers 

	We will probably end up with a wealth of people who want to
beta test our projects. We can offer incentives to these people as
well (although early use of the program should be enough).

6) The house
 A) Location
	Sameer wants it to be close to the UC Campus. Sameer attends
the UC, so I'd like to live close by. There's more people in the area,
which is a plus, as well. Choosing a place close to the PacBell's
Berkeley Cental Office would give us improved line quality and a
cheaper leased line.
	  The location is to be somewhere in Berkeley, while there is
also a small possibility that the house could be in San
Francisco. There are a variety of factors involved, some of which will
not be resolved for a while.  There is also a more miniscule
possibility that the nexi will fission off before even getting started
with locations in each city. (If we end up with say 20 *seriously*
interested people this would be the most likely scenario.)

 B) Size
	The house should be large enough to house 5-10 people (around
7 being considered optimum) When it comes to floors and number of
rooms, that is still up in the air this depends mostly on how people
want to live, some can handle living in rooms with one or 2 other
people while other people *need* thier own space.
	Ideally, the lower level would be with a kitchen, living room,
and bathroom, and the upper levels would house the private spaces of
all the residents, so that we can host parties while preserving the
security of each individual resident's space.

 C) Cost
	??? I don't know much much a 6 BR place near campus costs. I
read one ad that was a 6 BR place, allegedly "close to UC" for
$2400/month.

Status: 

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

	(Could some exi-bayer please forward this to the main
Extropians list? I've been busy lately and unsubbed. Thanks.)

	This young motivated, energetic, talented cypherpunk is in
search of some sort of summer position, internship, whathaveyou which
will use his skills to the fullest.
	I've been hacking UNIX for the past three and a half years
now, and I've been employed using UNIX for the past semester. I've
been spending much time outside of class & work learning perl and
other fun elements of UNIX-- I've installed linux and xwindows on my
roommate's 486. I've recently been working on a fully anonymous anon
server which protects users against direct attacks upon the server
itself.
	Although I spend a great deal of time outside class learning
to administrate my local machine, I have still found the time to do
well in my classes. I plan on majoring in both Computer Science and
Physics because they are both so compelling that I can't choose one or
the other.
	While I would prefer a position which is BARTable from
Berkeley, because I don't own a car, I can probably get a car if
needed.

Subject: Re: Weekend update
Status: 

Warning -- long posting!!

I started out the weekend by switching my flight from Friday am to
Thursday evening when I heard George Clinton and da P-Funk mob were
at Townsend.  Unfortunately, bad weather at SFO closed down one
runway and we were held up a crucial hour and a half.  By the time
I got to Townsend around 11:30, it was already sold out :(

Friday I went to the monthly Well party and given the bad weather decided
not to check out the MESS party at Hillegass St., although in retrospect
it would have been a good idea from the other reports I got.

Saturday started with Two Nineteen Ninety Four -- thanks so much to
Bryce, Seth and everyone who helped make it happen.  It was a big kick
to spin . . . I unleashed my promised 'house 2 da max' set and had a good
time.  One of these days I'll actually hit *all* the mixes, but there's
no question, doing anything for an audience teaches you a lot faster than
any number of hours practicing.  I was able to catch a good part of
the sets by Jon D, Ethan, Susan and Dean, and catch up with our sfraves
crew!

A prior commitment had us heading out the door at 8 into a torrential
rainstorm.  Eventually we made it to Slim's for NRBQ (rock and roll,
for you youngsters :).  Unfortunately, Slim's management is even greedier
than usual, so the show ended at about quarter after 10 so they could
clear the hall and start up with Booker T & the MG's at midnight.  Now,
Booker T is where I started all this vinyl nonsense back in 1969, so 
I was interested in returning, but after just a bit over an hour of the
Q and then being rudely booted out, we said 'good riddance' and headed
over to Hamburger Mary's for late dinner including a classic air guitar
performance by our server.

I wasn't ready yet for the expected crush at Cesar's so instead I went
over to Townsend, my old stomping grounds (literally :) though I haven't
been there in months.  The sound system is still superb and when I walked
in Markie had just started, so I spent a couple of pleasant hours grooving
to the club/house mix he provided.  A decent but not packed crowd, lots
of dancing.  Joe Clubgoer gives it three stars :)

Not that I really planned it, but I ended up then seeing Jeno and Garth
at Come/Unity to round out the usual wicked suspects.  I've been enjoying
Jeno much more since Xmas and this was no exception -- especially pleased
to hear him use Ripe's "Passion" and get a *big* reaction from the floor
(so "now I know" about using that one :).  Garth finished up with a
flourish including some onna acidjazztip.  

It was packed at Cesar's but not unbearable, although the floor flooded
when Garth came on.  And I just don't understand why people drift
aimlessly through the dance floor to begin with, but that goes in my
"What makes a clubber tick" research file . . . I also was stabbed
briefly by someone carrying an incense stick through the floor, no
damage but it was briefly surprising.  

I don't want to over-analyze the cultural mix, what I said to Ovid that
he quoted above is really just an observation that's hardly based on
any systematic analysis.  While 'rave' may be dead, one offshoot is that
Wicked, Come/Unity and others have evolved their approach to attrct
the interest of regular clubbers and the younger crowd -- this has
opened up the formerly elitist, stifling club scene in a big way and
that's generally for the good in my view, even though it means a lot
of these events don't measure up to the quality standards we might
otherwise have.  A peaceful, non-alcohol oriented event that mixes a
variety of races, classes, genders and attitudes in relative peace and
literally gets us all off the streets for hours at a time is a remarkable
accomplishment in these times.

Concerning the gangsta element, I think the hard-core gang bangers stay
away from these events for the most part, but the wannabe types or those
who are close to that scene get a very important new context at these
events.  There really aren't a lot of alternatives for younger folks in
those situations as far as social events.  I get pretty tired of the
sullen, forceful types who push their way through the floor and look
like their faces would break if they smiled -- but that's actually
just a small number out of the overall number, generally.  And really,
given the crowding and the potential for hassling, it's remarkable how
well these events go off.

Finally, I am pleased to give props the Lyons security people who handled
the front door.  Someone must be working with them, because they were
much easier to deal with this time, and I saw them defuse a situation
outside with someone who was clearly trying to trap them into a hassle.
Now if we can just get them to do like that at the Galleria . . .

After a few hours sleep, I went down to do a little record shopping at
Tweekin' and had a nice chat with Charlotte, who's now a resident DJ
for Zuvuya Sunday nights at 1015 Folsom *and* the DJ for the Broun
Fellinis *and* the house music buyer for Star Records (Susan is still
doing the imports and trance/tribal/ambient).  

Later I talked Ovid into going over to the Kennel Club; I come out of the
reggae/African/"world music" (hate that latter term) tradition as much
as anything, and I had heard great things about the club and resident
DJ Doug Wendt who does the big Sunday massive, but in truth I was
disappointed.  The tunes were heavily oriented toward hip hop, the crowd
was a pleasant but self-engrossed club scene, and the videos were domestic
shite interspersed with occasionally interesting abstract stuff.  
The spinning was just records, no mixing and no matching, with BPMs
wandering all over the lot.  Not enough African music at all, but that's
my own bias.  It was getting a little better when we left at 12:30.
However, I got lots of good ideas for my reggae/dub/African DJ planning
which I'm hoping will reach fruition in a couple of months.

(I should mention we ran into none other than Bryce on Divisadero on
the way over to the Kennel Club :)

Ovid dropped me off at 1015 where I hoped to sample Zuvuya for a while,
but it was basically empty when I got there, so I walked over to DV8.
Thanks Ovid for talking me into going to Spundae; I hadn't been since
Susie and I went there in September and had a nice time with Henrik at
the turntables in the basement bar.  

This was Clubber City of course, and I just missed seeing Dub Tribe, but
on the whole I had a *very* good time.  There was some kind of weird
floor show in the big upstairs room around 2:30, followed by a good
club house set (don't know who was spinning at that point).  I love the
sound in that room.

Then I went downstairs just in time to catch Jeno (yet *again*!).  The
little ceiling-mounted boxes in the basement bar are really inadequate
for sound, but he overcame that and did two solid hours of straight
ahead energetic house.  Between upstairs and downstairs I think I was
out on the floor about three and a half straight hours!  Things were
still going upstairs when I left right at 6 am.  

I logged in a little later and learned about the events in Seattle.
Left a message for Andrew Smith of XLR8R, he later returned my call --
it turns out he and some of the Seattle posse are in town all this week,
so we had lunch at the Mad Dog in the lower Haight, then checked out
Tweekin.  Finally I stopped by Star before heading back to Portland
this evening.  Whew!

Subject: Brief Update on Choclit Factory
Status: 

I spoke with Andrew Smith, editor of XLR8R, today about what happened
at the Choclit Factory in Seattle on Friday night.  Andrew says he
was taking a nap when some of this happened but here is the gist of it.

Around 6 am, as this weekly put on by our net.friends Glenn, Greg and
others was winding up, a couple of people got in a dispute and went
outside.  One shot the other dead, and then came back inside with his
gun, at some point pointing it at himself.  He apparently had been on
speed for days and was undergoing serious delusions.  The event shut
down and everyone stayed inside quietly while the police dealt with
the situation (apparently the police were quite impressed with the
self-discipline exercised by those in attendance).

The news media have carried the story regionally, but it seems to have
been billed as an 'all-night benefit fundraiser' rather than a 'rave'.
I haven't seen any of the coverage myself yet.

The Choclit Factory crew met on Saturday night to sort things out,
and basically are making a call for unity in our scene to help address
this specific tragedy and the underlying factors that are involved.
Andrew told me that Greg may be working on a write-up for the net,
so I don't want to speculate any further, and let me emphasize again
that while Andrew's report is from the scene, he did not witness the
entire chain of events.  

The new issue of the XLR8R had just been printed (copies at Tweekin'
and I believe Housewares and elsewhere), so there won't be anything
in the current issue, but Andrew promises substantial coverage in
next month's issue.

I've already said my piece on my initial reaction to this news, but I
want to reiterate the importance of helping with rumor control on this,
since the media coverage may or may not unfairly represent what happened.
In addition, please take all the reporting here as second-hand and
open to correction.  I thought, however, it would be important to
bring at least the outline of what happened to everyone's attention
so that the chances of misunderstanding are reduced.

Thanks.  Peace out.

In response to all the messages I've been receiving lately concerning 
the government's blind side on privacy:

When you have a bone to pick with your senator or congressman, you get 
people together and begin to mail your feelings en masse to the guy's 
office.  Well, we have an infinitely easier way to do it and the 
potential of coercing more into voicing their opinion as well: the 
president and vice president both have Internet addresses.  Sure, they 
don't personally read it, but does your congressman or senator, either?  
And besides, if enough do it, the general message *will* make it to the P 
and VP's ears.

Perhaps it is because I'm not old enough yet, but I still hold to the 
tenet that this government and it's actions should be an expression of 
*our* feelings.  

Could some kind of letter of disapproval be written up, consented upon, 
and then mailed out to all on this list and on others, to be bounced back 
to president@whitehouse.gov ?  Would anyone be interested?  

And why the hell isn't shit like "New privacy laws are kept secret" front

The President 
The White House 
Washington, DC  20500

Dear Mr. President:

     We are writing to you regarding the "Clipper" escrowed encryption
proposal now under consideration by the White House.  We wish to
express our concern about this plan and similar technical standards
that may be proposed for the nation's communications infrastructure.

     The current proposal was developed in secret by federal agencies
primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not privacy
protection.  Critical aspects of the plan remain classified and thus
beyond public review.

     The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
opposition to Clipper.  In the formal request for comments conducted
by the Department of Commerce last year, less than a handful of
respondents supported the plan.  Several hundred opposed it.

     If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop
new products will face extensive government obstacles. Cryptographers
who wish to develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be
discouraged.  Citizens who anticipate that the progress of technology
will enhance personal privacy will find their expectations
unfulfilled.

     Some have proposed that Clipper be adopted on a voluntary basis
and suggest that other technical approaches will remain viable.  The
government, however, exerts enormous influence in the marketplace, and
the likelihood that competing standards would survive is small.  Few
in the user community believe that the proposal would be truly
voluntary.

     The Clipper proposal should not be adopted.  We believe that if
this proposal and the associated standards go forward, even on a
voluntary basis, privacy protection will be diminished, innovation
will be slowed, government accountability will be lessened, and the
openness necessary to ensure the successful development of the
nation's communications infrastructure will be threatened.

     We respectfully ask the White House to withdraw the Clipper
proposal.

Sincerely,

[ Over 25,000 people, so far ]

Greetings,

I want to thank everyone,  especially Jessie and Seth for providing a
great place to hold the SFR party last weekend.    Especially I want to
thank those that allowed me to spin my new records I got from ir-dial.

It is most unfortunate that MOST people never got the chance to hear me
spin,  cause I went on first,  and as luck would have it,  the rain kept
MOST people from getting there early enough to hear me,   but eventually,
I might be allowed to spin in front of more people next time so more can
hear these new trancey tunes I have.

I believe that Brycer has taped my segment,   and hopefully the tape came
out.   If so,  I sure would like to obtain a cassette dub of my set sometime.

Thanx ---

I too really like the idea of the DIY parties. As I accumulate more
fun lights, science toys, and other fun stuff, I'll be happy to bring
them to free parties.

On a related note, how much do light show people make at larger
events? I might be willing to throw some non-trivial money at a serious
laser setup if I felt I could eventually make most of it back. I
_love_ lasers and there aren't enough of them at parties!

By the way, Greg and I had a *wonderful* time in the park Sunday. They
didn't do an event there, but it was a fabulous day, so we got out my
giant bubble making stuff and entertained people in the gardens and at
the bandshell in front of the science museum. At any one time we'd
have 20-50 adults and kids just totally going gaga over the huge
bubbles. It was a super fun vibe and very inexpensive. About $3 for 4
hours of bubbles :). We'll do it again sometime and bring a picnic
lunch and you all are of course invited ;).

I recently read with dismay about Wired Magazine's legal fight to
prevent the women's group WIRE from using wire.net.  For the first
time, a corporation threw lawyers at someone over an Internet address,
and believe it or not, it was Wired.  Somehow I had gotten it in my
mind that Wired had an enlightened outlook on things, that they were
proactive in promoting use of the Internet, and connecting people and
resources.  I had even offered to volunteer some of my time and
programming skills in order to help Wired offer better services.

But sometimes my optimism is naive, as I have found out in Wired's
case.  Wired is about money, and is not above bullying a women's group
into changing their name, even though it's highly unlikely anyone
would ever mistake it with wired.com.

I was just about to subscribe to Wired.  But because of this shocking
display of callous heavyhanded legal tactics, I am not going to
subscribe.  Rather, I am going to relate Wired's treatment of the
women's group to all the computer users I know, who will be extremely
unlikely to pay for the magazine knowing what it really stands for.

A minor set-up (red HeNe beam 1-5mW) runs about $100-200 for the unit and 
power supply. You basically can get a spot out of this and simple 
patterns. The more complex the pattern, the dimmer it will be. I don't 
have one myself, so I don't know if it's worth it to get one or save up 
for an actual visual display laser (which I believe starts at the 1-5 
Watt range). These set-ups can easily start running into several hundred 
dollars for the beam unit alone, not including the motorized mirrors (or 
whatever you call them).

I like lasers a lot, but I don't think their use is very inventive. Or at 
least I haven't seen much creative use of them. The only thing that 
really stood out was the wave pattern that the COme/Unity folks pulled 
off after the ceremony at the first Malachy benefit in Richmond. That was 
one powerful laser, probably the strongest show laser I've ever seen. By 
the way, did you know that there's an actual law in California that says 
any laser light show *must* be directed above the heads of the audience? 
I've never heard of a party ever being busted for it. 

For me, the most interesting way to go is *cheap*. You get pretty 
inventive when you don't have much money. And the results usually end up 
a little more interesting than the off-the-shelf variety. At the very 
least it draws attention to itself as a hand-constructed object (e.g. the 
dreammachine and hallway 'spots' light) which I think is more appropriate 
for the f&f parties. 

Ideas for the next party: A call for lava lights! How many can we collect 
for one room. I've only got one, but I'm sure there are several of you 
out there with one also. Imagine a wall of multi-colored lava lights. 
I've seen it once in Chicago and it's a great effect.

Shadow screens. I have a pop-up frame (about 3'x5') that I can attach 
some mylar to. Does anyone have any good projection material?

Let's get some ideas going. JMAR. click.

Status: 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
This is a notice to the entire nation of ravers of what happened here
in Salt Lake City last week.  I am sending this out so this person
can be stopped, and also so our city isn't completely black-balled
over the incidident.

Davey Wallbeck did not.  His promotions were always cash influenced
and geared in a rip-off manner.  He had been arrested previously for
check-writing and had continue to finance several of his promotions
in the same way.  The last time I DJ'd, I received a flyer from him
for a rave in which the Hardkiss brothers would be playing.  I had
met Robbie previously, and ran into Scott via Jon Drukman at the Orb
at Warfield.  I felt bad that their introduction to Salt Lake City
would be through Davey.  However, I never expected the resulting
disaster to ensue.

I was phoned yesterday by a friend who told me that Davey had not
only shafted the Hardkisses on their payment, but had left town with
all the rental equipment as well.  All in all, he stole a U-Haul
trailer, several thousand dollars worth of lights, and probably in
excess of $10K of sound equipment.  Even though I am not associated
with the scene anymore, I know how difficult it will be for the other
promoters remaining to throw gigs now.

I have no idea where Davey has gone, but be on the lookout for him. 
He is about 5'9" with long black hair.  He is almost oriental in
appearance and has a big greasy grin on most of the time.  If you run
into him, REPORT HIM.  DO NOT SUPPORT him, or you run the risk of
your scene being tarnished as well.

On behalf of Salt Lake City, I apologize to the Hardkisses and
Hardkiss Music over the entire mess.  People like Orbital, Garth,
Carlos, Moonpub, Mark E. Quark, Eli Star, and more know what kind of
good treatment is possible in Salt Lake.  I wish I could only make it
up to you.

There are only three names that I can absolutely recommend to DJs who
are thinking about coming to Salt Lake.  My own, TASTE, which for the
most part is only doing small, free, outdoor events,  Playscool, and
Mechanized.  If anyone else talks to you, get your cash in advance.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

	I can personally attest to the truth of this post, and being a DJ
here in Salt Lake, I'd like to add a few things.  First of all, Davey
is half-japanese, in case that helps anyone to identify him.  He has
promoted raves under the name of "Squish", and for a short time,
under the name of "Evil Puppet Head."  He was a partner in the Evil
Puppet Head clothing line, and while they are no longer in business,
he still has a small inventory of Evil Puppet Head merchandise, and
he's probably wearing it.
	I DJ'd at one of Davey's parties a couple of months ago, and made
sure to get my money in advance, because I've known for a while that
he is not above trying to rip his DJ's off.  Not only did he rip-off
the Hardkisses, he also attempted to rip-off Dazy, another local SLC
DJ.  The last 2 parties he's thrown have been completely
profit-related, renting the bare minimum in equipment, throwing the
party in abandoned warehouses that legally should have been
condemned, and taking money at the door (a sure sign of impending
bust).  The last 2 parties he threw were busted before 2 am.  I was
shocked when I arrived at the party I was to DJ at, and found that it
was in a warehouse that was totally unsafe.  There was exposed
electrical wiring everywhere; there were massive holes in the floor
(some as big as 10' by 10'), which Davey simply covered with plywood
panels.  There was also no running water.  I voiced my complaints to
Davey, but he simply had no real concern.  I could tell that the only
truly important thing to him was to pack as many people in at $10 a
head as he possibly could before the cops arrived.  No promoter
should knowingly throw a party that will get busted.
	If you do run into Davey, please report him to the FBI.  He is on
file there not only for check fraud, but also for grand theft.  The
scene here in Salt Lake isn't large enough that many people have
their own sound equipment or lights, and he's made it so that the
people that have been renting sound and lights to different promoters
are going to be a lot more hesitant to do this in the future.
	Perhaps Davey doesn't realize the extent of the damage that he's
caused for all of us, but we like to think that our scene promotes
peace, love, unity, and respect.  Davey has seriously damaged these
ideals, and the public's view of our scene.  If all ravers are viewed
by the public as drug-abusers, thieves, and felons, we won't have a
scene anymore and underground parties will be outlawed.
	I apologize for the length of this message, but I seriously hope
that Salt Lake City won't be looked down upon based on the actions of
a single individual.  I can also give good recommendations to
Playscool, Mechanized, and Taste, as these promoters have been
involved in the scene here for quite a while, and have always been
honest in the way they do business.

Peace, Love, and Bass...

I saw Jeno for the first time at the small Wicked party on Friday.  I 
wanted to thank him because I had such a great time there!  I love the 
music he spins and at times I became totally submersed in the music.  
Although I was really sick from a two month cold (flu?) I had a fantastic 
time.  I didn't see Thomas spin but I know I loved almost every second of 
Jeno's spinning.  (I didn't like a record that had this annoying whistle 
blowing as part of the background music.)

Yeah I've got a pretty good idea of what laser prices are. A used
argon laser with a decent power range starts at about $1800 and
another $900 for the power supply. If you're handy with breadboarding
(I am) you can put a set of galvos and an amp together for $200-$600,
depending on the quality of the galvos. Then you need to throw in a PC
+ soundcard + software, which, as I said before, is non-trivial money.
I wouldn't even think of tossing down that much money unless me and my
accountant thought I could make a good chunk of it back.

On the other hand, for smaller parties, I could put together a 25mw
HeNe + 2 galvos (& maybe 1 more for blanking) + amp for about a grand
with a little wheelin' and dealin'. This would be more appropriate for
smaller parties anyway, as red is a nice friendly color.

I agree that most laser shows are quite boring, and that the one at
C/U in Richmond was exceptional. I think the trick is not to use
canned software but write your own. I know where I can get some
shareware source in C++ to drive lasers for about $10. It would be
really fun to write one's own effects. I also have an idea for a
*real* head tweaker, but it's a secret until I can actually pull it
off :).

So, like I said, does anybody know how much visuals/laser people
make per show?

Subject: ...shock, loss, grief...
Status: 


Phred, thank you for taking it upon yourself to relay information and 
for trying to keep misinformation to a minimum.  It's to that end that 
I offer this posting, to try to get closer to what actually happened.  
But the fact is we still don't know _exactly_ what happened.  I myself 
don't have the whole story and as it was only witnessed a part of it, 
so there's not much I can say for sure other than the impact has been 
_deeply felt_ , is very far reaching, and is not over yet.   As the 
process of gathering information and reconstructing the events is not 
yet complete, and since there are many different accounts of what 
happened, this is at best an attempt at more accurate information and 
is subject to correction as we find out more.

At 6AM Saturday morning, Rafael Gonzalez was shot outside the Choc-Lit 
Factory.   Both parties were outside, and the sequence of events 
leading up to their being outside is still unclear.   They were _not_ , 
as local news media have indicated, ushered outside to resolve their 
"argument."  From the accounts that I've heard, there were no 
indications of a dispute or precipitating incident that anyone observed 
so chalk that one up to media inaccuracy.

At first, nobody knew what had happened because the moment of the shot 
itself was extremely sudden.  Word spread to various people inside the 
Choc-Lit Factory who sealed off the doors, called the police and 
medics, and took steps to find the suspect and make sure that he wasn't 
a continuing threat.  The police arrived shortly, took stock of the 
situation, took the suspect into custody and started their 
investigation. Throughout it all, everyone kept their cool and was very 
cooperative (though extremely shocked and freaked out) and the 
subsequent events proceeded without incident.  The police indicated 
that they were saddened that this event happened, partly because in 
their view things were going so well.  It is true that the police were 
very impressed by how well everyone present worked with them, and 
stated this to both us and the media several times.  The 
mental/chemical state of the suspect is still under debate and, again, 
there are still many conflicting stories.

The aftermath:  first and foremost, we have lost one of our own.  This 
has been an enormous loss to our community and the process of grieving 
has hardly begun.  Rafael was a talented artist, an active participant 
and generous organizer who gave _tremendously_ to the Seattle House 
community.  He was known by many, many people, was respected and 
deeply, deeply loved.  His parents loved him so much that even now they 
push through their hurt to open the book of his life wider, to find out 
the things of beauty that they never knew of him, to come to understand 
those things that he loved better.  I knew him personally, and will 
always feel the pain of his absence, and that those who did not know 
him will not get the chance to...and it hurts that he won't be able to 
see how much we've come together because this...

...Rafael, we will always miss you...
....and your spirit will live on in all of us...

As for the person sitting in a cell right at this moment, he was one of 
our own too.  That probably hadn't been talked about much up until this 
point, but he was.  That makes this all so much harder to take.  He has 
a much harder road in front of him now, and for him it is just 
beginning.  I suppose we could condemn him now, but what's the point?  
He doesn't need that, and it won't bring Rafael back.  He deserves our 
thoughts and compassion not for his actions, but for himself.  Right 
now all of us are attempting to understand what happened in him, how it 
came to manifest itself in a moment of violence, and how we could have 
kept him from getting to that point.  I can only hope that he is able 
to come back to us some day, to share and return our warmth, support, and love.

This incident has had a widespread and devastating impact upon all of 
us, and each person seems to be coming to terms with this in their own 
way.  Many are reevaluating their own personal involvement with and 
committment to each other and the community.  Some things I've heard 
center around _really communicating_ that we care about each other, and 
taking extra steps to genuinely connect with and take care of each 
other, even if sometimes that seems like a really hard thing to do.   
Above all, there is a commonly held resolve to _not_ let this tragedy 
destroy everything that the community has worked so hard to create, 
namely an environment of love, trust and sharing.  If anything, I think 
this tragic event has strengthened our collective resolve to make our 
world a better place, even if we have to work through blinding, 
stinging tears for quite some time.

Thanks for your support and kind thoughts.  Glenn sends his love and 
hopes to be in contact soon.

Peace.  Love.  And take care of each other.

Common courtesy is to respect other people's views even if one

Debatable. Very debatable. Once again, I can pull up a large list of
even more unrelated topics that weren't chased down by the list

It was a grievance of mine against Wired for doing something I
consider unethical. In any case it was not a grievance against Brian
Behlendorf, though he seems to act as if it were.

Look, when a company does something that I believe is very bad, I can
call them on it. My viewpoint is valid to me. Others are not required
to agree, though they might.

Which just goes to show that perhaps one shouldn't post when one is
tired and frustrated. One might see a debate, or one's opinion
expressed, and decide to make a very personal attack on someone one
knows.

And before one calls me an arbiter for calling the behavior of a
company unethical, one perhaps debeam one's own eyes and stop calling
the posts of others "garbage".

Don't we all. I don't remember you complaining when the discussion

Similar services such as what? The same services which come with just

I got news for you. Lawyers aren't omniscient. A lot of the time,
they're more harmful than good to their own clients. Most of them, I
believe, are bad for society as a whole.

No, the dispute was over wire.net. And it's not taking the issue to
absurd heights, if you've followed the growth of the internet.
Internet ".com" addresses are going the route of the UUCP namespace -
it's getting harder and harder to find a name that doesn't collide
with one already on the net. Now Wired is trying to set a precedent
that says you can't even think of a name that *sounds* like something
else. It's taking a scarce resource, and making it much more scarce.
It is *not* absurd to be concerned about this, and it is not
unreasonable at all to call such behavior antisocial.

	Yeah I've got a pretty good idea of what laser prices are. A used
	argon laser with a decent power range starts at about $1800 and
	another $900 for the power supply. If you're handy with breadboarding
	(I am) you can put a set of galvos and an amp together for $200-$600,
	depending on the quality of the galvos. Then you need to throw in a PC
	+ soundcard + software, which, as I said before, is non-trivial money.
	I wouldn't even think of tossing down that much money unless me and my
	accountant thought I could make a good chunk of it back.
	
	On the other hand, for smaller parties, I could put together a 25mw
	HeNe + 2 galvos (& maybe 1 more for blanking) + amp for about a grand
	with a little wheelin' and dealin'. This would be more appropriate for
	smaller parties anyway, as red is a nice friendly color.
	
	I agree that most laser shows are quite boring, and that the one at

That's not even what I meant or implied.  SFRaves has the appropriate
level of anarchy for me.  It's just that seeing as how I'm one of the

should be respected.  So, this is my last post about the subject

Thanks for all of your notes of support, condolence and encouragement.  
We'll relay these to Rafael's parents who have definitely appreciated 
knowing that there is a large number of people who loved him and cared 
about him.

Rafael's parents are making a huge gift to us.  They are allowing the 
community he put so much of himself into to help with the memorial 
arrangements.  They have arranged for public viewing, Thursday 1-7pm 
and Friday 1-8pm at the Columbia Funeral Home, on Rainier Ave. South 
and Alaska St.  The memorial service will be Wednesday or Friday next 
week.  We're working on getting examples of his artwork, scultpure, 
photographs, and stories for the memorial, so if you have any 
information on where these can be obtained, please give me a buzz back asap.

Since funeral arrangements are a sudden and considerable expenditure, 
we're both  organizing a benefit event and setting up a fund for anyone 
who would like to contribute.  A physical mailing address for the fund is:

Glenn Fajardo
430-12th Avenue East, #102
Seattle, WA  98102

or call the Choc-Lit Factory infoline (323.4304) and leave a message 
and we'll contact you.  Or if sending return e~mail is easiest, just 
reply to me.

What we've seen over the past few days is that we _are_ pulling 
together as a community, and that all of us are affected by what each 
of us does.  Many new doors for direct and honest communication have 
been opened between the individuals who make up our community, and the 
focus has been on making the positive outcome possible.  Again, thanks.

Peace!  And don't wait to tell someone you love them.

Talking about lasers, John A. Martinko sez:

> benefit in Richmond.

Sounds similar to an effect I saw Pink Floyd use at the Silverdome
back around '87.  They had two (Argon?) lasers sweeping a sine wave
that filled the entire dome.  It was kind of a trip, 40,000 people
cheering a beam of columnated light.

They ran it just after the break.  I supposed this was so they could
use the by then plentiful cigarette smoke as a dispersing medium.

I've played with HeNes and have "assisted" friends with slightly more
exotic stuff.  I may not be the best person to talk about lasers, but
there are a couple of points that should absolutely be discussed.

The first thing to remember is to BE VERY CAREFUL.  If you don't know
what you are doing, you can get yourself and/or others hurt in ways
that do not heal, ever.  Get a pair of laser glasses, if you can.
Know your power ratings.  Overbuild your setups, if a beam-splitter or
mirror were to come loose, a perfectly safe beam coming out of your
box in a perfectly safe direction could turn into something else.

Never leave a laser box untended.  I'd put a keyswitch (power switch
that requires a key to be energized) on it if it was going to be used
at parties or events.  A keyswitch will only cost a couple of bucks,
could save someone's eyes, and helps you build a case as a prudent,
safety-concious-type-person in case somebody does something really
stupid.

Most of industry is going to solid-state lasers for low-2-medium
power, which has dumped a fair number of nice HeNes on the surplus
market.  Maybe they're all gone now, I haven't checked in a while.
HeNes are temperature stable and fairly durable, but they don't like
being beat on.  They're basically light-bulbs, and like being treated
as such.  Solid-state lasers are pretty tolerant of vibration, but are
not particularly temperature-stable.  HeNes are red.  For various
reasons, it's usually easier to make a laser work at lower
frequencies: red or even infra-red.  Oh yeah, HeNe is Helium-Neon.
Because of the way gas lasers work, every laser of a given type is
exactly the same color as every other (exotic tunable lasers
excepted).  All HeNes are a red I'm sure you'd easily recognize.

Your power supply can cost more than the laser "bulb."  You can build
your own, though.  Commercial power supplies add a lot of expense to
deal with "igniting" a cold tube.  You can simplify your design, and
just use a start push-button.

There are a couple of ways of generating interesting laser patterns
with mirrors.  You can mount mirrors on speakers.  High-power tweaters
are supposed to work best, although I've never wanted to sacrifice
one, and haven't run accross any damaged in useful ways.  Take the
cone off, and mount a mirror between the center of the speaker and the
frame, in such a way that it can freely change angle as the speaker is
driven.  Mylar tape works as a hinge, I think Scientific American had
and article describing such a setup maybe 8-10 years ago.

Now, hook up your speaker to an audio source.  The lighter your mirror
is, the higher frequencies you'll be able to use.  If you mount two of
these at right angles, your can drive the spot in X and Y.  An old
analog synthesizer or even a drum machine can generate interesting
patterns.  If you have something that can generate stereo programmable
waveforms, you can even make simple vector-generated shapes.  You can
record these on casette tapes, and use the volume, balance, and tone
controls of your amplifier to wiggle them about.  Your second mirror
will need to be bigger than your first.

A typical thing to do is to mount mirrors at angles on little
speed-controllable motors.  Old 8-track motors are getting hard to
find, but the casette ones can frequently be made to work.  Bounce the
light off of the first mirror at a shallow angle, and you can line up
several stages in a shallow arc.  

You can put a "beam chopper" in the beam path.  This is just a disk on
a motor with a slot cut in it, so that as the disk turns, the beam is
alternately obstructed and revealed.  Put a speed control on it, and
you can get various "dashed-line" effects.  If the speed control can
stop the motor, you can turn this effect on and off w/o too much
trouble.

If you have a bit stronger electronics skills, you could use stepper
motors for more exotic effects.  Steppers are available surplus, or
from the guts of dead floppy, hard disk, and CD drives.  Careful with
the CD laser though, it's no fun to look at, only dangerous.

Ice cream shops frequently sell small quantities of dry ice.  AV
rental places frequently carry smoke machines, which are better for
parties.


Happy lasering!

For me, the most interesting way to go is *cheap*. You get pretty
inventive when you don't have much money. And the results usually end up
a little more interesting than the off-the-shelf variety. At the very
least it draws attention to itself as a hand-constructed object (e.g. the
dreammachine and hallway 'spots' light) which I think is more appropriate
for the f&f parties."

Silverdome, eh? Well, fellow Detroiter, The effect you describe is 
probably the same thing. I can say it's trully amazing to see a green 
plane slowly descend on the audience. The had just fired off the fog 
machines beforehand to increase the effect. Had to pick my jaw up off the 
floor.

As for the techniques you described, now *that's* my kind of tinkering. 
You can be assured yaur meesage will be saved for when I actually do blow 
some money on a set-up. Fiddling around and building stuff by hand just 
seems so much more fun. Where's the best source for tubes? I've sent away 
for a few catalogs I saw in Nuts&Volts and I'm waiting to see what they 
offer. What's the minimum wattage needed to project across a medium-sized 
room (about 30-60 feet)? HeNe is fine as red is a less jarring color 
(inmyopinion) than the green argon ones (though I secretly hope to get a 
blue someday *sure*). Thanks for the info. JOHN.

Great idea! I get a little leery about open flame around a bunch of 
people though. I bet cyalume sticks could take care of that, and when was 
the last time you saw green light spilling out of a pumpkin? You can be 
sure you'll see them this fall. <idea filed into permanent storage> Of 
course we can make shadow masks out of other things too. That's basically 
the idea behind both the dreammachine and the 'spots' light. 

Mark some pumpkin carving down on your calendar for this october! JOHN.

MULTIMEDIA MAGAZINE TO DEBUT ON INTERNET



First there was "Internet Talk Radio," a weekly radio talk show broadcast to listeners
tuned to their desktop computers. 

Now, get ready for The Electric Eclectic, the first Internet talking magazine. 

Nathaniel Borenstein, the magazine's creator and a member of the technical staff of
Bellcore Corp. in Morristown, N.J., describes his creation as a multimedia
"metamagazine." 

"I'm thinking more and more in terms of The Electric Eclectic not being so much a
magazine as a do-it-yourself magazine construction kit," Borenstein said.
Subscribers will be able to design their own virtual magazine based on continually
evolving topics , or "threads," and choose the frequency of delivery. 

Computer-delivered magazines are not viewed as a threat to traditional magazines,
according to some publishers. "It will be not so much a direct competitor as it will be
for the customer's time," said Malcom S. Forbes Jr., president and chief executive of
Forbes magazine. "The consumer is going to have more choices." 

Forbes adds, "We're looking and sniffing and willing to experiment. We're not
wedded to the post office." 

The Electric Eclectic, to debut later this year as a non-commercial service to the
Internet community, will display pictures, sound and text on a computer screen. 

Vinton G. Cerf, president of the Internet Society, plans to contribute an article, using
sound, that shows how hearing-impaired people can benefit from computing and
networking technology. Cerf is close to the subject -- he is hard of hearing and his
wife is deaf. 

Borenstein said anyone with a PC or Macintosh and a few common hardware and
software items should be able to experience The Electric Eclectic's multimedia
attributes. 

Magazine threads will be transmitted using "store and forward," a technology that
allows users to receive high-bandwidth materials on a low bit-rate modem by
stretching out the transfer time. After the material is loaded into computer memory,
it can be accessed and played back in real time.

Racist stereotypes about alcoholic Scandinavians? I'd never heard that one
before, but now I have, thanks to you.  I'll have to try extra hard to
overcome those unfair misconceptions, now that they've polluted my mind.

Steven's Creek Surplus in San Jose carries the following colors:

I know that's a bit of a drive for you, but almost any military
surplus store should carry them.  I've found green Cyalume sticks in
auto part stores as well (check the roadside emergency supplies

Geez, if they're so high tech, you think they'd be able to figure out how to 
format text so that it wraps correctly on an 80-character screen.

Subject: White House Wiretap Bill
Status: R
 
 
CyberWire Dispatch//Copyright (c) 1994//
 
Jacking in from the Budget Busting Port:
 
The White House today began floating its version of the controversial
digital wiretap bill that requires all communications systems to be made
wiretap ready.  The bill has teeth.  It gives the Feds the right to shut
down any telephone, cable or computer network that fails to give law
enforcement what it wants:  Easy access to any and all conversations.  Bar
none.
 
The new bill, a copy of which was obtained by Dispatch, is a "new and
improved" version of the fatally flawed FBI digital wiretap bill that
atrophied on Capitol Hill during the Bush Administration.  That bill was in
flames before the ink dried on the draft copies.  It mandated compliance
from industry within 120 days of passage ("fucking impossible," one
telephone executive said at the time) and required you and me to pay for
making the FBI's job easier.  "No fucking way," was the general consensus,
from industry as well as a wellspring of privacy and civil liberties
groups.
 
The Clinton policy wonks, however, seem to be twisted students of history.
They've bought off on the general principle of the bill, but sought to take
the sting out of it.  Here's what those brilliant Thirtysomething
workaholics have decided:  They'll allow telephone companies to pay
"reasonable costs" for all software and equipment upgrades to make this
happen.  Then these phone companies can send the bill to the Feds, and
Uncle Same will pay them back all "reasonable costs" for the wiretap
access.
 
Brilliant scheme, right?  Except, what's wrong with this picture? First,
there's absolutely no definition of reasonable cost. Second, although the
government pays for it, where the hell does the government get its funds?
That's right:  Joe and Jane Taxpayer.
 
Or perhaps Clinton will simply cut the appropriations budget for the
Headstart Program?  Or how about trimming a few Cruise missiles from the
procurement list?  After all, as Dispatch has reported, someone is going to
have to pony up more than $1 billion for all this.  Talk about a budget
buster.
 
Three Years or Yer Out
======================
 
If the bill passes, and it must first find a sponsor, industry will have 3
years to comply with its mandates.  But the heavy lifting is left to the
switch manufacturers and equipment makers. Once they get their act
together, all this software and hardware is turned over to the carriers to
install. But they have to hustle:  No grace period.  Three years, max.  And
just for comparison sake, it's taken the phone companies more than 7 years
to code in equal access dialing, a job that was supposed to take three.
 
If that wiretap deadline isn't met, the Feds can actually shut down the
telephone network, a cable system or even computer networks like
CompuServe.  That aspect of the bill is "unconstitutional," says Jerry
Berman, director of Washington office for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.  "Injunction power over communications of the U.S. is a prior
restraint and far too broad under the First Amendment," he said.
 
And if those sexy digital calling features such as call forwarding or ISDN
applications foil the Feds *at all* they can demand that those services be
*shut down* until they are brought into compliance.  Oh yeah, and while all
that complying is going on, the telephone companies get kicked in the ass
to the tune of $10,000 per day.  That's the motivation factor.
 
Senator Patrick Leahy said Congress "wants to ensure that the
Administration's law enforcement goals are met."  However, that can't be
played off other concerns.  "We can't jeopardize the legitimate concerns of
business by empowering the attorney general to have the final say in how
far and how fast technology advances," he said.
 
Of course, there's the National Security Agency to deal with here too, but
nobody's saying a damn thing about them.  The NSA, however, had a direct
hand in helping craft this bill.
 
The White House meets Thursday with industry officials to break the news to
them.  The Administration will trot out the FBI to give its usually dog and
pony show rap that "we need to stop child pornographers" so pass this bill.
White House meetings with privacy and civil liberty groups takes place on
Friday. Stay tuned...
 
Meeks out...

Hate breeds more hate, regardless of the target.  One way raving has
affected me is with it's emphasis on a more positive approach toward
our imperfect world.  Instead of flailing my arms and screaming with
selfrighteous anger at the things I disagree with, I tend steer that 
energy toward the promotion of the things I believe in.  So instead 
focusing on my hatred of racism and ignorance so much, I now find myself 
expressing support for the the acceptance of diversity and the promotion
of greater awareness.  This may seem like nothing more than semantics, 
but this more positive slant toward life has really made a difference in 
the type of person I am, as well as my effectiveness on infuencing 
things around me.  I highly recommend it.

Coming from a city where there is the largest Finnish population in the
world outside of Finland, and being part of that culture, I can tend to
agree with the genetics bit (seeing it first hand in my family), but that is
certainly not the case with all or most scandinavian based cultures.

As well they should.  The KKK is a terrorist organization that lynched,
killed, burned, and raped many African-Americans, as well as others of
non-white origin.

>but how many people protested Republican fund raising events,

Why should they?  I am much angrier at the sellout Democrats and their
hipocracy than the direct and straightforward manner Repubs represent
themselves.  Let me remind you that the MAJORITY of the actively lynching
south (back in the day) were DEMOCRATS. I trust neither, equally.

Not enough.

According to you.  The KKK has left an indellible impression upon the minds
of over 22 million  African-American US citizens, not to mention those of
Jewish heritage, Japanese descent, and a host of other non-white citizens.

>Everybody hates the KKK. We're taught in school that
>KKK=racist, and racist is bad.

Call me cynical, but when I see young skinhead mothers, and hosts of people
saying "things are much better now...." I wonder how much we really have
learned.  Hate is on the rise, so obviously this message has not sunk in
yet.

>But not the Government, they're not racist.

The govt. is inherently racist.

gets closer to becoming a reality, the clubs are starting to thaw, allowing
a host of denizens the opportunity to get out of their caves and head into

SUNDAY MORNING AFTER HOURS

Lighten Up starts up in mid-late March (I was told March 20).  The venue
has not been chosen yet, but I'll hedge my bets on 1015.  It will be really
fresh, with a whole new vibe than what had been done with Boogie Buffet.
Preston will be working the space in whole new ways, and providing an even
better environment for all Sunday morning peoples.  Watch for it!!!

There are a group of DJ's thinking about doing something on Sunday as well.
But I cannot talk about it until they have secured a space.  These DJ's
will be doing the do on Sundays, providing an alternative to 1015 madness.
When I can say more about it, and wehn it will start, I will.

Besides DNA (which is still going on), I understand that Paul of DNA/Boogie
Buffet is also doing a Sunday thang, but once again, I dunno what it's
gonna be called (I have not spoken to him personally about it so....this is
second hand), but if anything it should be all Paul, which means it will be
all about a good time.

I know there is some other stuff going on, but these above are the new
digs, so check 'em.

You know, I picked up this mag from it's first issue (like many of us), and
have been, eh, somewhat encouraged that it's progressing along (I guess I'm

gives good article.

The one interesting thing I have found is the sheer NUMBER of old skoolers
who work for the mag, and ravers in general.

I hope the presence of these folx influences the mag in some different
directions every now and then.  The most interesting thing I found was in
the microserfs issue, where they, in a couple of articles, mentioned
"underground parties".  You could tell it was territory  new to them (just
in the awkward way the term was used), but they're growing.

I think it pretty cool to see people come from one culture and go into
another.  The most fascinating thing will be how these new immigrants (i.e.
old skool ravers), influence the mag in terms of it's content.  At least
the mag has the potential for change, and is a nice break from the
unpredictability (esp as it relates to circulation) of MONDO (hell I LOVE

As for WIRED's dealing with the internet.  No biggie, that's just ONE

The thing that I find interesting is the following line of logic borrowed
from Noam Chomsky, and extended with my own clipper chip paranoia...

(1) NAFTA passes.
(2) Days later, the crime bill passes
(3) Months later, more crime bills pass, w/r/t digital wiretapping. 
(4) "Three strikes your out" prison sentencing emanates from slick-willy's
    sphincter-like oral orifice.
(5) Come/Unity was cool. Huh huh huh huh. Gangsters suck. Heh heh.

What do all these things have in common? #5 is there so that I don't
get flamed for posting something nontopical on sfraves; #1-#4 are there
for the following reasons:

The passage of NAFTA is a boon for corporate management, the finance
industry, stockbrokers, and other such nonproductive members of
society. For labor, it will be a complete bust. It entails that we'll
be seeing massive layoffs of "workers" as their jobs move to Mexico and
other trade agreements begin taking advantage of cheap labor pools in
Indonesia, Korea, and the former Soviet block. Don't believe all the
Clinton hype about job retraining -- most of those people are going to
end up in shanty towns, and eventually, in prison.

All this is great for corporate CEO's and upper management. They have
much to gain from NAFTA since they won't have those steenkin' unions
and "overpaid" whiny workers. By tapping on the lack of labor reform in
the 3rd world, American corporations can pay lower wages, don't have to
worry about worker safety, work hours regulations, hiring of underaged
workers. It'll be a great return to the profitable sweatshop days of
yore, back when amerikkka found greatness through slavery, and then
worker abuse.

Eventually, the massive unemployment in the US is going to result in a
highly polarized society of haves and have-nots. The haves will just
move to more exclusive suburbs with bigger guard gates, fancier alarm
systems, and private schools (they'll probably even get tax refunds for
it....).

The have nots will start working in the US for 3rd world wages or face
starvation/unemployment. The US will in fact become more like a 3rd
world country in which the top few percent hold most of the wealth, and
the rest are dirt poor scum.  Massive unemployment among the
disenfranchised means higher crime,  carjacking, theft, robbery, more
drug use, more drug sales.

That's where the crime bill fits in -- as a way to manage and repress,
the "revolt" that is going to be a natural result of NAFTA and GATT
policies amongst the losers of the new policy. Isn't the timing of the
NAFTA hulabaloo and the crime bill quite interesting???

ANd now we have the digital wiretapping bills. What with an ever
increasing amount of our data being recorded and transmitted digitally,
we have an unparalled capacity to monitor the detailed goings on within
the country. The problems of archiving and filing the information that
plagued the STASI in East Germany will not be necessary --
supercomputers will collect and catalog immense amounts of data on  all
and sundry with incredible efficiency -- red-flagging anything that
seems out of the ordinary.

And what better way to snare the revolting have-nots than to catch them
in the act of planning or discussing  a crime whilst they forget that
their clipper-chipped phones are relaying crucial information to the
FBI and NSA. After all, we're talking about uneducated workers turning
to crime -- the educated criminals that understand the ramifications of
the FBI digital wiretap bill will all be working for the CIA, NSA, FBI,
Police, or managing the prisons.

And all those three-strike-your-out lifers are gonna make good slaves
anyways -- you don't think we're gonna let them just sit there watching
TV and pumping iron for the rest of their lives..... After all, slavery
is what made Amerikkka great (financially and militarily mighty,
morally and ethically corrupt). So why not just play some semantic
games on freedom versus slavery, so we can still preach the doublespeak
of democracy on TV, while talking of the prisoner's "debt to
society"...

I guess that's why Aaron Neville jumped the gun on this whole concept
and can be seen singing advertisements for the US Cotton industry on
TV... (Did anybody miss the irony of this, or did I just return from
Mars after a long sabbatical?)

Dear Sean,

What can I say other than it's too bad your opinion of WiReD has changed,
especially given the fact that you in no way had **ALL** the facts at your
disposal, and had taken **NO** part in the lengthy debate between the parties
and supporters involved.  (This debate lasted for at least three to four
months.  Much of it took place on the Well.  You might benefit in learning more
about what the folks at Women's Wire have to say about the issue's resolution. 
I suppose that wouldn't be as much fun as spreading rumor, however.)

Quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing arguments such as yours; myopic, completely
ill-informed, and self-righteous.

> Wired is about money, and is not above bullying a women's group

I'm very sorry you feel this way.  The truly unfortunate part, Sean, is that
you couldn't be more wrong.  But, since you've based your opinion on spurious
net.rumor at best (I'm assuming you have neither researched, talked at great
length with any of us here or either of the two key women at Women's Wire, or
read about the legalities of copyright), I suppose that's to be expected.

Your perogative.  Unfortunately, I suppose WiReD will be better off without
readers like you who will believe anything they read on the Net without having
done detailed research on their own; people who have no qualms about spreading
slander or libel which is based, not on fact, but on hearsay and ill-informed
personal opinion -- without labeling it as such.  Any good story has many sides
and must be filtered properly as a result.  It should not be simply spread
about like a meme.

> I am going to relate Wired's treatment of the
> women's group to all the computer users I know, who will be extremely
> unlikely to pay for the magazine knowing what it really stands for.

Sean, you unfortunately and obviously do not even begin to *know* what our
"treatment" was.  And please, do not profess to know or even guess at what
WiReD stands for.  You obviously have no idea.

Sincerely and Disappointedly,

Kristin Spence

It makes me wonder what they're going to do if three strikes isn't a
deterrent and the prisons keep filling up. (which I think will happen)
Oh well, after we've tried everything else, and everyone is tired of
paying and paying, perhaps finally then a bright light will go on and
we'll start putting real work into solving the problems rather than
the symptoms.

I want to thank all of the responses that I got, and I *hope* to put them 
to good use. The followup is because someone suggested live ambient 
music, and that's such an awesome thought that I couldn't wait to see if 
anyone else would be willing to do something live also. Currently there 
is a "Live in Studio A" show on Thursday nights, but I believe that I/we 
could do something at any other time also. So, are there any others out 
there? I read that there were live acts at the 2/19/94 party, and Davis 
is only about an hour away, so any takers/givers...?

Thanks,

The KKK has had an impact on white people too.  Or at least me.  In 1976 I
lived in Moss Point, Mississippi, a town near the Gulf Coast.  The people 
who lived across the bayou from us were a nice family, the father was the 
manager of a local bank branch, they had kids who went to school with my 
younger brother.  The family was of African-American descent.

One night the KKK came and burned a cross on this family's back lawn 
(their back lawn was adjacent to our back lawn with only the bayou in 
between).  We called the fire department because we saw flames.  The 
fire department did not come.  I won't forget that incident.  I've never 
been around such sheer hatred and stupidity before or since.

ObRaveContent:  last Saturday's party at Seth's was great.  Seth, you and 
your roommates were wonderfully generous in donating your place.  Everyone 
who brought gear, from the day-glo paint and shoe laces up to the speakers 
and amps, thanks thanks thanks.  I was amazed to see a full house what with 
all the rain.  Once again we threw a list party that was a success.  There 
was something there musically for everyone, which was great to see and hear
because I fully believe that providing people with variety, alternatives, 
and choices is a good thing at parties.

**************************statement text follows**************************
5 January 1994

On October 5, 1993, WIRED, a startup magazine and electronic publishing
company, notified WIRE,  a startup service which offers an easy-to-use online
product especially (but not exclusively) for and about women, that they felt
that the use of the name WIRE was confusing and infringed on WIRED's trademark.
After a series of negotiations, part of which dealt with the issue of whether
WIRED's trademark covered Internet domain names (such as wire.net), the
management of WIRE has decided to rename their company, service and net site.
As of January 6, 1994, this service will be called Women's Wire, and located on
the net at wwire.net. WIRED has agreed to help defray some of the printing
costs of changing Women's Wire's name on their stationary, manuals, brochures,
etc.

This dispute has been disruptive and personally taxing on both parties, and
both are relieved to have this settled. We wish to put this energy- and
resource-draining episode behind us. At the same time we acknowledge that the
contentious issue of trademarks in net domain names will not be left behind. We
support further public discussion of this and related intellectual property
issues on the electronic frontier.

hi good people,

i need to unsub for awhile, but  ... i'll be back ...

my 2cents on recent controversy -

i've seen this in almost every newsgroup or maillist. I don't have any
good suggestions (well, maybe i do - SHUT UP and LET IT GO), but i am
sorry to see it here. While i'm not a close friend of any of you, i am
acquainted with many and i hold this group is high regard. all of you
IMHO are great people. individually and as a group.

As a side-note, the extropian maillist is moderated with a fairly
strict set of rules, some of which directly deal with flame-wars. I'm
not suggesting sfraves uses them, but being aware of them can help
shape attitudes.

so, peace&love - take care

brian

since you say its about information, i was wondering,
was it wire.com? or wire.net?
cuz the diff. between wire.com and wired.com is very small i agreee
but i thought it was the other way around.

i already hashed this out with Julie Peterson (not that i know who she 
is and why that makes a diff.)  so im content,
but i would like to ask, 
if WIRE stood for Women's Information Resource and Exchange
then what does Women's Wire stand for?

i could put in a two page line addition on why this does relate to raves
but it really isnt

This is a notice to the entire nation of ravers of what happened here in Salt
Lake City last week.  I am sending this out so this person can be stopped, and
also so our city isn't completely black-balled over the incidident.

I was not in attendance.  The decay of a scene I fathered and fostered drove
me away completely at the beginning of the year.  The last time I DJ'd was in
honor of the death of two good friends.  Kevin Carlton was the only other DJ
in town who I related with on musical and non-rave terms.  Alan (who was his
best friend, and also died in the car accident) and Kevin always were the last
to leave.  They truly embodied the spirit of the original scene I was so
enthralled with.

Davey Wallbeck did not.  His promotions were always cash influenced and geared
in a rip-off manner.  He had been arrested previously for check-writing and
had continue to finance several of his promotions in the same way.  The last
time I DJ'd, I received a flyer from him for a rave in which the Hardkiss
brothers would be playing.  I had met Robbie previously, and ran into Scott
via Jon Drukman at the Orb at Warfield.  I felt bad that their introduction to
Salt Lake City would be through Davey.  However, I never expected the
resulting disaster to ensue.

I was phoned yesterday by a friend who told me that Davey had not only shafted
the Hardkisses on their payment, but had left town with all the rental
equipment as well.  All in all, he stole a U-Haul trailer, several thousand
dollars worth of lights, and probably in excess of $10K of sound equipment.
Even though I am not associated with the scene anymore, I know how difficult
it will be for the other promoters remaining to throw gigs now.

I have no idea where Davey has gone, but be on the lookout for him.  He is
about 5'9" with long black hair.  He is almost oriental in appearance and has
a big greasy grin on most of the time.  If you run into him, REPORT HIM.  DO
NOT SUPPORT him, or you run the risk of your scene being tarnished as well.

On behalf of Salt Lake City, I apologize to the Hardkisses and Hardkiss Music
over the entire mess.  People like Orbital, Garth, Carlos, Moonpub, Mark
E. Quark, Eli Star, and more know what kind of good treatment is possible in
Salt Lake.  I wish I could only make it up to you.

There are only three names that I can absolutely recommend to DJs who are
thinking about coming to Salt Lake.  My own, TASTE, which for the most part is
only doing small, free, outdoor events,  Playscool, and Mechanized.  If anyone
else talks to you, get your cash in advance.

Please feel free to print this and distribute to record and clothing shops.
This person must be stopped.

I *may* have the chance to go to my _first_ rave next Saturday (the 26th) 
and I saw on the last calendar that not much's happening then. I was 
wondering which one would be the best to go to--I don't want to have an 
experience like those at the Sharon rave had--and if there's more to 
add, that'd be great. I plan to drive to Concord or wherever the closest 
BART station is and then ride to wherever it is. So the location would 
have to be close to a station. Directions are a necessity, as I don't 
know the city well--or much at all :).

Thanks a heap,

Mike	<masolis@ucdavis.edu>

Re: Sean's "what hapens when the prisons fill up?"

Simple! We make MORE! The Emergency Drug Act or whatever the hell it
was called (I can look it up) proposed TENT HOUSING for "drug and
violent criminals" should prisons get overcrowded. It proposed to
suspend (for the duration of the "drug and violence emergency")
the rules regarding "how crowded is TOO crowded?"

I don't think the bill/act/whatever got passed, at least I haven't
heard of anything it specified being carried out, but it still
has a point: Overcrwoded prisons are not a deterrent to stricter,
harsher laws and punishments.

"Lock up all you want, we'll make more..."

	Please read the section below regarding the formatting of entries 
	you might send to this list to be included.  I will NO LONGER 
	accept mis-formatted entries.  Too much work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


         The Great Usenet Just-Say-NO-to-PISS-TESTs Project
This is the Great Usenet Piss Test Registry Project Monthly Posting.

You will find two lists in this postings.  The first is a list
of companies that have PISS or other Human Quality test
programs as reported by first person experience.  The second
list is a list of companies that are known to have public
policies AGAINST the invasion of privacy and the violation of
Constitutional Protection that Human Quality tests constitute. 

If you have FIRST PERSON experience (no rumors) with a company not on these 
lists, please send a note, in the format of a record in the
tables below, to the following address:

	piss@dixie.com	<<<--- preferred, mailers like this domain
	piss@rsiatl.uucp  (old method)
	emory!dixie.com!piss
	uunet!dixie.com!piss

Your identity will be protected and all identifying data will be 
deleted from DIXIE as soon as the list is updated.  I will attempt to 
acknowledge your message but with mailers being what they are, if you 
don't get an acknowledge, please send a duplicate.

***** Please NOTE:

    If you send information on a company, please try to fill in all fields
    in my form.  Particularly the "recourse" field.  Many people are 
    forced to choose between the lesser of 2 evils and knowing what
    the company does beyond forcing the piss act is important.

Obtaining the Current List

If you would like to obtain a copy of this list at intervals other than
the first of the month, an automatic server will ship you a copy.  Simply
send mail to the above addresses and set the Subject: line to "send".
Any text in the message body is dropped.
Example:

Subject:  Send list

The list will be returned to you via your From: address.

Those of you not on the Internet should determine how to send mail
to and from an Internet address.

For those who desire a paper copy or who do not have electronic mail,
you may order a copy from me by sending $2.50 (Domestic), $5 (foreign)
to the following address:

John De Armond  C/O
Performance Engineering Magazine
PO Box 669728
Marietta, GA 30066

Tests other than Piss tests should also be reported to this list.  For
example, if your company has a mandatory medical test and requires the
right to release the results to insurance companies or others, you should
send a note. (I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.  Your life insurance policy has been
disapproved.  Your company medical test showed too much chlorestrol and
too high blood pressure.)

NOTE:  If you think an entry is incorrect, please let me know.  Be aware,
however, that I require **FIRST PERSON** experience or information in
order to place an entry in the list or to modify one.  If you work for
a division of a company listed herein and you believe the company
policy to be different than what is listed, be SURE to check with
your human resources department to verify COMPANY-WIDE policy before
asking me to correct something.  If ANY division of a company makes it
to the bad list, it is presumed all employees in that company are at risk 
and thus the whole company is listed.  Such is the cost of corporations being
Washington Establishment-Correct.  Again, a company that does human
quality testing ANYWHERE within the corporation is considerd bad
and so listed.

If you are a corporate executive for a listed company and do not like seeing
your company on this list, you have two options:  a) if the entry is 
factually incorrect, it will be corrected and b) you can drop the offending
practice.  In either event, send me an official company position on the
topic.  Otherwise save your energies.

                  **** Statement of Purpose ****

This list exists as a one man crusade (supported by a cast of thousands)
against the current Government sponsored terrorism sometimes called 
the Drug War, and the resultant destruction of the Constitution.  This crusade 
is about Constitutional protections, individual privacy and freedom.  It 
is NOT an advocacy of the abuse of any mind-altering substance.  It is a
strong plea to consider the data contained herein when making purchasing
or employment decisions.

Note:  I try to keep this list with the columns aligned with spaces
	Occasionally, however, tabs creep in.  This list is formatted with
	tabstops set to 4.  To properly view the list in vi, execute the 
	command :set tabstop=4.  To properly print this file, route it 
	through pr(1) with the command line pr -e4 -o4 piss.list |lp
	for Sys V.  For BSD or other systems, you're on your own :-)

Permission To Copy

I hereby grant permission to reproduce this list intact anywhere as long as
the purpose of the reproduction is to inform people about and/or fight 
human quality testing.  It may not be reproduced by anyone unfriendly
to this cause or used in any manner in the Drug War on the Constitution.
It also may not be reproduced in any manner that could be construed to
promote illegal drug use.  Publication in "DEA Today" would be strictly
prohibited, for example.  Publication in "High Times" might be OK,
depending on the context.  I suggest you contact me if you have doubts.
Credit to the list's publisher (me) and information on obtaining updated
copies of this list must be retained.  

Important Notice
----------------

09/06/93
All DOE Federal Contractors will be required to negotiate some
version of substance abuse testing as part of a national program.
Employees at SLAC, Stanford University, have learned that many
different accomodations to this requirement have been achieved
depending on workplace risks.

The DOE rule which applies appeared in the Federal Register
on July 22, 1992, page 32652, (Vol57, No141)

1.  There is no testing of any kind and the company has made a public 
    policy statement against any such testing.

2.  There is no testing but the company has not made a policy statement
    public and/or has no policy.

[3] This is taken from Varian Network, a news letter to employees.  About
    positive results in the interview process, it said  that after an
    employment offer is accepted the employee provide a urine sample.  If it
    tests positive the employee will meet with a medical officer.  If the
    positive result is confirmed the offer of employment is recinded and the
    person may not reapply for 6 months.

[4] The testing company will re-test *the same sample* on a positive result;
    if the re-test is positive the candidate is not hired.  There is *no* retest
    from a different sample.

[5] Lynchburg, VA.  The personnel director is: Larry Langhans

[6] Texas Instruments, Lewisville, TX plant, fairly certain that all other
    Texas plants are also doing it (especially Dallas).

[7] tests for: cocaine, amphetamines, pcp, marijuana. only tests for
    5-8 substances. If the first test is positive, the sample is
    subjected to a more detailed test.  If both tests are positive,
    a medical review officer contacts the employee and asks about
    medication; the employee has an opportunity to have medical
    review officer call every one of his/her doctors. If medical
    review officer determines that no legal substance caused a
    positive test, employee's supervisor and management chain are
    ntoified. Employee can be sent to mandatory drug counseling and
    follow-up testing, or fired. On any following positive test,
    employee will be fired unless department head intervenes. There
    is a wider range of disciplinary actions than indicated here.

[8] contract house: they ask if you will take the test
    on the application form.  I was told that most
    clients who do not test wish only contract help
    that is willing to be tested (like requiring the 
    test without performing it).

[9] Must sign a waiver giving company rights to use results of test in any
    way they wish.  (I assume this includes sharing the results with other
    possible employers and/or Insurance Company Data Banks.)

[10] Only applicable to `inside' contractors and regular employees.  Testing
    not required for `outside' contractors.

[11] Topaz is a subsidiary of Square D corp.

[12] CostCo is a wholesale consumer goods store that has signs outside
     proudly proclaiming that they abuse their employees with piss tests.

[13] Each business unit in AT&T sets its own policies.  Bell Labs and
     certain other units do NOT test.

[14] Corporate medical director keeps copies of ALL test results.

[15] Reliable Rumor has it that SCO is quite a party company!

[16] This company has a drug-free environment statement on file but 
     does not test.

[17] they run a check on your dmv and if you have outstanding failure to appears
	 dui, etc. they don't hire you.

[18] Company has an official drug-free workplace statement which prohibits
    posession or use of illegal drugs on company premises, and prohibits
    reporting for work while under the influence of any illegal drug or
    alcohol.  No attempt is made to prescribe employees' activities during
    their off hours.

[19] It was asked why they hadn't published their "drug-free
    workplace" policy in their help-wanted ad, like other companies.
    The answer: US Windpower doesn't want to foster an image as 
	a "conservative company."

[20] Psych. Profile testing is not required for individual contributors.  
    However, a satisfactory Psych. Profile Test is a prerequisite for entry 
    into management.

    January 1, 1994 at sites in Boise, Idaho; Vancouver, Washington; 
    Corvallis, Oregon, and Roseville, California.  Testing at all other 
    U.S. locations will follow beginning March 1.

[22] Brooktree is a company that DOES NOT do Human Quality Testing.
    In fact, every employee is given a plaque with the "Brooktree Values":

    value #6 reads:  "Brooktree believes everyone - including employees,
                  customers, shareholders, and suppliers - should be
                  treated with mutual trust, honesty and respect."

    Value #7 reads:  "Bureaucracy is counter-productive to the efficiency
                  of a rapidly growing company.  Systems are created to
                  to facilitate, not complicate, the smooth operation of
                  the business."

    Value #10 reads: "We believe informality promotes goodwill and leads
                  to a creative and productive environment.  Brooktree's
                  operating style is characterized by informal meetings,
                  open doors, frequent on-site social gatherings,
                  comfortable dress, and use of first names."

	Brooktree has on-site monthly parties with beer, wine and live bands.
	Beer and wine are also served at "all-employees meetings".

[23] Testing is performed before offer is given (ie. offer is contingent
	upon successful completion of the tests).  Unsure as to what recourse is
	taken if tests are not completed, but it would appear that no consent
	to testing would prevent an offer of employment from being made.

[24] Litwin is "AN OFFICIAL MEMBER OF THE HOUSTON DRUG FREE WORKPLACE INITIATIVE
   (or whatever else the DEA is calling itself these days")  They have
   instituted a random test/random search of office and person.
   Recourse is undefined at this point, but the announcement stated that
   one could seek confidential counseling prior to being asked to take a
   test but not after.

[25] Comdisco allows certain valuable employees who will not take a piss
   test to work as contractors.  The definition of hyopcrisy. 

[26] Sony Corporation of America, including Sony Workstations in San Jose.

[27] No hire after positives on initial and automatic re-test
[28] other - company requires submission of Social Security Number with
            resume for any consideration.  Also is smoke-free work
            environment.

[29] T.J. Rogers told the press, "If I instituted drug testing
            at Cypress, I would get a brick through my windshield.
            And I would deserve it."

[30] Formerly GE Consulting Services.
[31] Formerly GE Aerospace.
[32] also: Merck, Sharp, and Dohme; Astra-Merck Inc, DuPont-Merck Inc.
   Blood and piss are drawn for drug screen.  Urine test done first, if
   positive, check is done with blood.  Blood is also drawn for blood
   chemistry - cholesterol, etc.  Full physical on new-hire and return
   from any disability, including hearing, vision, EKG, chest XRAY,
   blood pressure, pulse, pulse under stress, and complete medical
   history.  Any medications are disclosed at this time (prior to
   test of urine/blood).

[33] Additional urine test required after returning from 12 or more months
   of extended leave.  Also has a no smoking policy -- no smoking anywhere on
   the grounds, including in your own car if parked on the grounds.

[34] Atlantic Research Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEQUA,
    has a policy that encompasses random drug testing but, in practice,
    does no drug testing at the present time because of the expense.

[35]  The company also reserves the right to search an employee's vehicle and  
    person upon reasonable suspicion.

[36] The following note was received regarding The Registry, a member of
	the "bad" list.  I have asked her to correct any errors there may
	be in the entry.  Since she has not done so, I've placed her original
	note here.  I should also note that a recent issue of "Inc" magazine
	(9/93 or 10/93), in a report promoting human quality testing, 
	used The Registry as a case study.  While the report did not mention
	drug testing per se, it DID metion their use of personality testing.

    I have just received a copy of your publication titled the Great

    used our name in this listing.

    The information you posted on The Registry, is inaccurate.

[37] In addition to the information you provide (which is accurate BTW):

  1.  There is also a random search policy for individuals, their
      personal effects, and, *with a warrant*, their homes.
     
  2.  Employees are terminated for misuse of *legal*, over-the-counter
      drugs, such as Sudafed.  If you take more than the recommended
      dose, you will be terminated.  Isn't *that* special ;-(

[38]  This has to be the prototypical anti-piss-testing policy statement:

    FringeWare Inc.  hereby resolves, by unanimous approval of the
    shareholders and Board of Directors, that it opposes any and all forced
    drug testing of its employees and will not establish any policies which
    conflict with this publicly stated position.  Moreover, FringeWare Inc.
    will hereafter endeavor to encourage its vendors and subcontractors to
    follow suit in countermanding oppression by pee-sniffing fascists who
    would usurp our individual rights, and the Board of Directors has
    collectively vowed to piss on anybody who tries to make us initiate
    testing.

    Signed: Jon Lebkowsky, President
            Paco Xander Nathan, Vice President
	[update 07/07/93]
    FWI vice president Paco Xander Nathan sued Motorola over their drug testing 
    (and won, upheld last month in the 5th Circuit Appeals Court), before 
	leaving to help build smaller, more adaptive firms.
    

[39] If tested positive the lab will do another test with the same sample
    and you may request another test within 72 hours at a company approved
    lab at your expense.
    If tested positive on pre-hire, they will not hire you. You may reapply
    in 45 days.
    If tested positive while working, there is a mandatory 10 days off w/o
    pay and must test negative before returning to work. There will 4 more
    random tests within the next 12 months.
    If there is second positive, 15 days off w/o pay & 8 tests in the next
    24 months.
    Third test - TERMINATION
    Results will be in personnel record for 2 years

[40] NOTE:  Citibank tests only for cocaine, heroin, pcp, amphetamines, and
    barbiturates.  No marijuana or psychadelics (except pcp) are scanned for.

[41]   Management has considered instituting potency testing of certain drugs,
       but lacks consensus on which drugs to test, so it remains at the
       employees' discretion.

This is on the topics Niels Mayer raised about NAFTA and that measly
excuse for public policy:  Three Strikes an' Yer Out.

What kind of a name is that anyway?  "3 strikes..." What is this, a
baseball game?  Why did they pick this particular slogan, rather than
"lock'em up and throw away the key.."  Which is what it amounts to.

This topic reminds me once again why I like the rave/sfraves/techno/
futurism community- which is us!  When society around us is getting more
and more repressive, we're building the connections we need JUST BECAUSE
WE FEEL LIKE IT.  The politicians are trying to make us fear and hate
each other.  But the connections we make via raving and via sfraves with
folks we've never even met before...(pardon me, this feature really blows
my mind still!) really drives home the point that EVERYONE has something
to contribute.  Including the folks that all the politicians want us to
fear.  And it kind of makes me wonder:  maybe what it is they want us to
fear is what they themselves fear?  That maybe someday all the so-called
criminals will pull together and overthrow the government?  

Well, I personally don't give rat's behind what paranoias the politicians
and powerbrokers and corporate vampires are secretly developing.  But I
do care about freedom of speech, privacy rights and community-building.
Since our community is often an "underground" community, i think every 
raver out there should do his/her bit to preserve privacy rights in general.
Fighting the clipper chip is a good place to start.  And also the Digital
Telephone bill.  If you want any information on either, I will forward
it to you.  

Take care all and rave on!

Last night I went to what might have been a Deep Space party. When
asked, Jason (Spun) replied, "this is NOT a Deep Space party." 
On that note, if it was a deep space party, it may well have been the 
last.Yes, the LAST! Of course that doesn't preempt any other similar 
parties that may also bear the name deep space ;)  (all standard 
disclaimers apply)

Anyway, it was in a warehouse in Sunnyvale. the space was provided 
by a fellow SJ housian. Sound by???  Visuals by Pure, I think? The 
set up was good. 

To be honest, I wasn't really in the mood. I mostly just chatted with 
folks outside. Everyone was very friendly. Given that most of them 
are friends, this came as no great shock. The energy was extremely 
mellow, which was nice- but the dance floor never reached critical 
mass. I wasn't crazy about Spun's set, but like I said- for me 
there was no there there. I left shortly after two, missed Harry Who,
and probably the real party, which probably started around 4am.

EFF Statement on FBI Draft Digital Telephony Bill

What YOU Can Do

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Subject: Digital Telephony - FBI "Wiretap Bill" Resurrected
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Clinton Administration is backing a proposal by law enforcement
agencies that could make the entire communications infrastructure
susceptible to surveillance.  The Digital Telephony Proposal, reintroduced
this year after being successfully thwarted last year, would require
communications service providers to include "back doors" in their software
through which "wiretapping" can be done.  In addition, the proposal would
give law enforcement officers access to records *about* communications,
such as who you call and how long you talk.  Such traffic analysis can 
can reveal vast amounts of information about you.  EFF is extremely
concerned about this proposal and has prepared the following summary to
explain it and the harm it could do.  More on what *you* can do to fight
the Digital Telephony Proposal will be coming soon.

------------------------------


Subject: EFF Statement on FBI Draft Digital Telephony Bill
----------------------------------------------------------

EFF has received a draft of the FBI's new, proposed "Digital Telephony"
bill.  After initial analysis, we strongly condemn the bill, which would
require all common carriers to construct their networks to deliver to law
enforcement agencies, in real-time, both the contents of all communications
on their networks and the "signalling" or transactional information.  

In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National Information
Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be used by law
enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards.  This image is not
hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the technology and 
inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy protections for users of
communications networks.

Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to maintain
status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological changes, in
fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools.  Among the new
powers given to law enforcement are:

1. Real-time access to transactional information creates the ability to
monitor individuals "live".

The bill would require common carrier networks (telephone companies
and anyone who plans to get into the telephone business, such as cable TV
companies) to deliver, in real-time, "call setup information."  In the
simplest case, call setup information is a list of phone numbers
dialed by a given telephone currently under surveillance.  As we all come
to use electronic communications for more and more purposes, however, this
simple call setup information could also reveal what movies we've ordered,
which online information services we've connected to, which political
bulletin boards we've dialed, etc. With increasing use of
telecommunications, this simple transactional information reveals almost as
much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally
followed us around on the street, watching our every move.

We are all especially vulnerable to this kind of surveillance, because,
unlike wiretapping the *content* of our communications, it is quite easy
for law enforcement to get permission to obtain this transactional
information.  Whereas courts scrutinize wiretap requests very carefully,
authorizations for access to call setup information are routinely granted
with no substantive review.  Some federal agencies, such as the IRS, even
have the power to issue administrative subpoenas on their own, without
appearing before a court.  

The real impact of the FBI proposal turns, in part, on the fact that it is
easy to obtain court approval for seizing transactional data.

The change from existing law contained in the FBI proposal is that carriers
would have to deliver this call setup information *in real-time*, that is,
"live", as the communication occurs,  directly to a remote listening post
designated by law enforcement.  Today, the government can obtain this
information, but generally has to install a device (called a 'pen
register') which is monitored manually at the telephone company switching
office.

2. Access to communication and signalling information for any mobile
communication, regardless of location allows tracking of an individual's
movements.

The bill requires that carriers be able to deliver either the contents or
transactional information associated with any subscriber, even if that
person is moving around from place to place with a cellular or PCS phone. 
It is conceivable that law enforcement could use the signalling information
to identify that location of a target, whether that person is the subject
of a wiretap order, or merely a subpoena for call setup information.

This provision takes a major step beyond current law in that it allows for
a tap and/or trace on a *person*, as opposed to mere surveillance of a
telephone line.

3. Expanded access to electronic communications services, such as the
Internet, online information services, and BBSs.

The privacy of electronic communications services such as electronic mail
is also put at grave risk.  Today, a court order is required under the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act to obtain the contents of electronic
mail, for example.  Those ECPA provisions would still apply for the
contents of such messages, but the FBI bill suggests that common carriers
might be responsible for delivering the addressing information associated
with electronic mail and other electronic communications.  For example, if
a user connects to the Internet over local telephone lines, law enforcement
might be able to demand from the telephone company information about where
the user sent messages, and into which remote systems that user connects. 
All of this information could be obtained by law enforcement without ever
receiving a wiretap order.

4. The power to shut down non-compliant networks

Finally, the bill proposes that the Attorney General have the power to shut
down any common carrier service that fails to comply with all of these
requirements.  Some have already called this the "war powers" provision. 
Granting the Department of Justice such control over our nation's
communications infrastructure is a serious threat to our First Amendment
right to send and receive information, free from undue government
intrusion.

Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

"Relying on the government to protect your privacy is like asking a peeping 
tom to install your window blinds."    

     - John Perry Barlow, EFF co-founder, "Decrypting the Puzzle Palace"

You've been following the newspapers and reading EFFector Online. 
You know that today there are several battles being fought over the future
of personal privacy.  The Clipper Chip, export restrictions, the Digital
Telephony Proposal - the arguments are numerous and complex, but the
principles are clear.  Who will decide how much privacy is "enough"?

The Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that individuals should be
able to ensure the privacy of their personal communications through any
technological means they choose.  However, the government's current
restrictions on the export of encrytion software have stifled the
development and commercial availability of strong encryption in the U.S. 
Rep. Maria Cantwell has introduced a bill (H.R. 3627) in the House that
would liberalize export controls on software that contains encryption, but
needs vocal support if the bill is to make it out of the committee stage.  

The decisions that are made today will affect our futures indefinitely.  
EFF is a respected voice for the rights of users of online technologies
and EFF members receive regular online updates on the issues that affect
our online communications and particpate in shaping the future.

Now, more than ever, EFF is working to make sure that you are the one that
makes that decision for yourself.  Our members are making themselves heard
on the whole range of issues.  To date, EFF has collected over 4100 letters
of support for Rep. Cantwell's bill to liberalize restrictions on
cryptography.  We also have over 1000 letters asking Sen. Leahy to hold
open hearings on the proposed Clipper encryption standard.

If you'd like to add your voice in support of the Cantwell bill and the
Leahy hearings, you can send your letters to:

cantwell@eff.org, Subject: I support HR 3627
leahy@eff.org, Subject: I support hearings on Clipper

Your letters will be printed out and hand delivered to Rep. Cantwell and
Sen. Leahy by EFF.

You KNOW privacy is important. You have probably participated in our online
campaigns.  Have you become a member of EFF yet?  We feel that the best
way to protect your online rights is to be fully informed and to make your
opinions heard.  EFF members are informed, and are making a difference.

I have no idea whether ROBINS52@snycorva.cortland.edu messages

and arresting perpetrators...

------- Forwarded Message

"According to the News-Gazette [local Champaign-Urbana newspaper],
Christopher James Reincke, 18, was arrested for sending e-mail to the
White House on Dec. 4 threatening the life of President Clinton.  The
message read: "I am curious, Bill, how would you feel about being the
first president to be killed on the same day as his wife...It would be
best, I think, to not continue with your immediate plans.  Perhaps a
vacation.  You will die soon.  You can run, but you cannot hide."
(Ellipsis appear in the newspaper story.)  The message was signed
"Overlord" and purported to be from "Allmighty@Never.Gonna.Catch.Me".
Again according to the News- Gazette, Reincke admitted he had sent the
message.  Apparently he's been arraigned and released OR."

So presumably under vt100 emulation, a Big Ugly Ascii Graphic of a
badge will appear and then it's only moments until they're carting you
off to the J. Edgar Hoover building?

Or are those with non-graphic workstations simply rounded up without

I understand your point, but I don't like what it implies: as though we 
need to cater what we say to some *subjective* arbitrer of justice.  This 
whole schpiel about the FBI "just trying to catch criminals" pisses me off for 
the reason (among others) that it assumes that the government is the

Greetings Friends!

Just wanted to join Atomic Rooster in inviting all of you to join us this Sunday the 27th of February for Atomic Dog, a Chinese New Years Celebration of the Year of the Dog. 

This is the fourth in a series of a parties thrown on the last night of the run of Gratefaul Dead shows at the Oakland Coliseum. 

As always the party is *free* and will go from 6pm till somewhere between 12am and 2am. We'll be in the far east side of the Coliseum's north parking lot. 

Believe it or not, this party now has the blessings of BGP who stopped by last time to compliment us on the sound system and the great vibe that a couple  hundred happy, dancing people inevitably generate. 

Djs this time are: Paraffin  Ethan  Susan and Garth.
Musically there will be something for everyone! 
And, for your listening pleasure: audio by soundvision

This is a great party; hope to see you there.

take it easy

I picked up my roomates Spin mag. with Juliana Hatfield on the cover and
fully intending to read all about this demi-goddess when I came across an
article about The NASA tour and raves.  As I was reading I notice a
particularly disturbing quote from some anal-retentive bloke claiming that
"Raves have become a place where bored kids can go to hang out and do
drugs." I almost had an massive coronary when I read that.  The things
that we try to promote (unity, understanding, etc...) on this list were
single-handedly wiped out by some corporate-rock-type-pinhead!  (I quoted
Darryl, the editor of Scene magazine located in Denver, Co.)   He also
went on to say that, "the interest is growing but the scene is dying."  I
don't know about you but I'd say its far from rotting to an abismal
"trend".  The misinformed author of this article also said that Aphex Twin
launched, "sonic grenades at the crowds lower chakras."  Oh gawd, he made
the scene sound like a supermarket novel full of "writhing, sweat purple
headed warriors mounting love puddings!"  He also mentioned the "legendary
telephone hacker, Captain Crunch."  I don't know Capt. Crunch at all.  In
fact I hardly know a thing about him. But the fashion in which this article
was written, it would seem insulting to the Cap'n himself.  Let's here some
comments on this one. I know I stopped writhing to the sonic grenades long

Subject: Political Party for ravers formed in UK; also Noam Chomsky to speak in bay area in April
Status: 


Hi,

Issues of freedom and democracy might seem tangential to the main
thrust of this list, but I believe they are of fundamental importance.
There are great freedoms in this country, and I think it's important to
know them, exercise them, and protect them.  (Personally I also like
to keep in mind the responsibilities that go side by side with rights.)

Things happen in other advanced western countries that (probably)
couldn't happen so easily here - at least not yet.  For instance I read
in a British newspaper this week that a new party (political that is)
was formed in London this past weekend.  It's called the Advance Party
and is an umbrella party for British ravers, sound-systems and Travellers.
One of the organizers of the party quoted in the piece is from the
Spiral Tribe sound-system, Ms. Debby Staunton.

Their first party meeting was held in a flat in Islington in north London 
this past weekend, the police busted it at 3am and broke up the meeting.
Neighbours complained of noise.  Four people were arrested after 
"an officer had been struck by a missile".  Now personally I don't like
to keep my neighbours awake with loud music at night, but I also
ask myself, how many times are British citizens lives disrupted, traffic 
diverted, because of events orgainzed by the classic political parties ?
(And I write as someone who was a member of a manisnteam Party 
in England.)

The main motive for the foundation of the new party was to fight the 
Criminal Justice Bill, which among it's provisions makes it illegal for more
than 10 people to gather in a public place if the police believe they 
may be planning a rave.  Or any other activity that the authorities
feel uncomfortable about I guess.  The new Bill also repeals the 1968
Caravan Sites Act, which laid a duty on local authorities to provide sites for 
travellers.

The new party will also provide information on how to respond to
police who erect roadblocks to prevent people from travelling to
raves, confiscate sound-systems, assault ravers, etc.  If I get a chance 
over the next few days to type the full article in, I'll do so, and post it here.

And so... I thought I'd share the following information with you all, 
since (1) Noam Chomsky is a great speaker and (2) he has stood up for
the rights of US citizens and  (imo more importantly, because they have 
less) the rights of citizens of other countries, some of them client regimes
of the US - and often when it was less than popular to do so.

I reckon this will be powerful food for thought for those who want to
inform themselves about issues like privacy, rights, freedom and how these
may be curtailed in the future.

"To quote the business pages, we're creating 'a new imperial age' with
a 'de facto world government.'  As you'd expect, this whole structure
of decision making answers basically to the transnational
corporations, international banks, etc.  It's also an effective blow
against democracy.  All these structures raise decision-making to the
executive level, leaving what's called a 'democratic deficit.'    Not
only that, but the general population doesn't know what's happening,
and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know."

Hmm... a big *badge* flashes across your screen? :/ Sounds kind of fishy 
to me-
I mean- why do you think the FBI wuold want to give you all that warning-
 especially if you are using someone else's hacked account?
	I'll try to check this out further, and see if I can get any
more details....

It was decided awhile ago that directions to the FMR wouldn't be
posted to SFRaves, since the hype surrounding them was large and
most places they wanted to have parties were far surpassed by the
number of people who wanted to go.  I used to have a small list
of friends I would email the info to if I got it, but I've been so
far out of the loop as far as FMR's go over the past few months that
that list is pretty much unused anymore.  

Posting to the list asking to be added usually won't get results, 
because anyone who does happen to get directions usually doesn't
want to broadcast them either.  Try and use other means to get this
info - hanging around lower haight or so on the night before is 
usually a good way to find out.

And I don't remember who said that they were going to be coming from 
somewhere to a BART station and then barting it to the fmr, but if you 
want a ride from the berekeley bart station mail me, and we can pick you up.
(this is all going under the assumption that the fmr is in berkeley.)

        The best way to find out is to go to Lower Haight.  I used to live
two hours away from SF (now I live nine).  It sucked if I drove up to lower
Haight to the Horseshoe and found out it was in Santa  Cruz an hour away
again, but that's part of the joy of it the chase.  Sometimes if you call
the Wicked line they give hints. (415-512-5713) Some of you old skoolers
might know where a "column vigil" would be.  Anyway good luck finding but a
smart thing to do would not be to post it to the whole list or anyone you
may not know, it would be nice if we could trust everyone, but as I
understand the reason it is not posted anymore was because of suspicion of
being monitored before.  So always be careful.  Everyone have a good time

To all those intelligent folk that I've heard from here:

I think that there's some incredible thinking going on here on this 
forum.  I've been very quiet in the last few months but I have followed 
what all y'all have been talking about in that time.

To get to my main point, it's completely up to us to shape this 
democratic outlet we know as the internet.  It seems like some forces 
are beginning to threaten the integrity of our discourse on sfraves and 
beyond.  All this talk about internet tapping and eavesdropping has got 
me thinking.  Thinking a lot.

Let's make it a goal of ours to fight this initiative by censorious gov't 
officials who want to quell anything resembling subversiveness.  We need 
this voice because it facilitates the communication of a remarkable 
gathering of well-intentioned, meaningful Americans.  We can't let them 
slip into thinking the new generation of computer-fed, "know-nothings" is 
a group that will allow the powerful ones to compromise our own power.  

We have a chance to preserve what has become a gennuine forum for a 
budding cohert of individuals.  We need it and will keep a hold of it.  
Let's make a point of getting to that party in 1999.

Peace to all,

Status: 



	Every time that I give up on the Scene, Bonnie Dune never let's
	me down.  There is something about the site that transcends all
	the petty bullshit that we humans put in the way of the Real Deal,
	which is Oneness.

	When I asked the wicked posse what time they were going to roll out,
	the reply was "around 10", I laughed out loud and eventually thet
	laughed with me because we both knew that was total fantasy :)
	Still I was none too pleased to arrive at the site at 1:30 a.m. only
	to find about 200 ravers in the rain and the parking lot with
	someone's car stereo blasting and no sign of the sound system.
	Garth turn's up around 2:30 or 3 and tells me that the Van left
	right after him, (upon further interrigation, the truth came out,
	he did not actually see the Van leave, he called them and they said
	"they were out the door". ) The sound van finally shows up about
	3:30, but it is still raining and they have very few tarps so they
	don't want to unload the sound system in the rain.  At this point I
	figured I better ask Mom for help.
	I guess I should tell you that I have a special relationship with
	that beach at Bonnie Dune, it is a power spot for me, and I have had
	many an inspiring and transcendental experience.  Gaia consciousness
	is very strong at that beach and the it is very easy to tune into her,
	if you take the time to learn how.  Anyways I went up to the top of
	a cliff by myself, grounded, called in the elements and synched myself
	up with Mom and the spirit that lives at Bonnie Dune, I put in a 
	request for the rain to abate in the little area that we were in, long 
	enough for us to get set up. (1 st rule of weather working, never ask 
	for more than you need)  The rain stopped within 10 minutes.  We got
	the sound system down to the beach, but didn't have all of the rope 
	ties for the canope, fortunately a group of guys had a really nice 
	and let us use it.  They even set it up for us, and it was large enough 
	to get the DJ table and the sound system beneath it.  Everything
	was set up but Garth had disappeared, we searched for him for about 
	a half an hour.  Eventually Markie showed up and the party got started
	around 5:30 :)  And what a party it was.  It was interesting to see who
	actually stuck it out through all the trials and tribulations,  it was
	like we all had been through a battle together, when Markie dropped the	
	first beat, the crowd went off completely.  Momentum just kept building
	and Markie played a fantastic set, these are the kind of sets that make
	it all worth while, I found myself inevitably sliding into deep trance
	and what a feeling it was, Markie tweeking us out, Bonnie Dune wispering
	her subversive eco-rythyms and the crowd , the ravers who have devotion,
	who put up with the elements, disorganization, ego's and frustration
	to get to this moment right now, and once again, I'm reminded what it
	is all about, It's not about clean sound systems (although they are
	great), It's not about A or E, it's not about who can start on time
	or who can't (though I wish wicked would get their act together), It's
	not about the cops, or the politics, or big name DJ's orexclusiveness,
	IT'S ABOUT LOVE.  And as the daylight began to come, and I could look
	around and see eveyone's faces both familiar and some new, I realized
	that I come to these parties out of the Love and dedication that is
	demonstrated by the people who stick it out, through thick and thin,
	the entire Family, and I realized that there is a deep bond of love
	between each and everyone of use, that doesn't have to be spoken about.
	Jeno took over after Markie and played one of the best set I have
	ever heard him play, it has been a long time and I actuall saw people
	with tears in their eyes as he was spinning, it was like he came back
	to us just when we really needed him, he came through.  By this time,
	Mom had decided to unleash the rains once again but everyone kept 
	dancing, letting the gaia-shower clense us, the beach and the Scene
	all at once.  Once you commit to getting wet, it is very liberating
	to dance in the rain, It's very sensual and you stay cool and the air
	is clear and free from cigarett smoke.  It was wonderful to see so
	many people completely tranced out, "grabbing for straws" as jsl would
	put it, (I right along with them), Jeno, masterfully took us deeper and
	deeper, letting the waves was over the beach and the rain wash over
	our bodies and soul, clearing away the dross of an old cycle
	and preparing us for the new spring time to come.

	Blessed Be.

Subject: Registry DJ Service (fwd)
Status: 

Registry:

Welcome to a little project of mine.  While bumping around the rave scene 
out here in the North East I have noticed a problem.  There are lots of 
people out there who want to do parties, but they just don't have the 
resources for them.  While I can not help with some of the resources I 
can help with one that I am quite comfortable with, information.  So, I 
am starting up a small system, Registry, that will attempt to bring under 
one roof as much information as can be accumulated and disseminate it as 
efficiently as possible.

While the net has been a springing ground for a good amount of 
information it has yet to be codified and offered up for the rest of the 
community.  I have found that a large proportion of the rave community 
either can't or won't use computers and the nets.  Thus, I am acting as a 
point of reference to bring some of that information into broader use.

The first service of Registry will be the DJ Database.  This service is 
designed for commercial use by promoters, clubs and whomever else has use 
of it.  This is a pay for service.  Rates and costs are available by 
contacting me.  The purpose of the DJ Database will be to list as many 
DJs throughout the US as possible.  Lists of DJs will be made available 
to those interested in the service, then as the promoter wishes I will 
contact DJs, handle negotiation of fees, scheduling and the other 
associated details of the deal.  While the DJ Database is mainly for DJs 
I will also be working with anyone else who wishes to work in the rave 
community, including PA Acts, Lighting Technicians, Sound Technicians, 
Visuals, Smart Bars, and other concessions people.  My aim here is to 
become a one stop shop for promoters and members of the underground.

There will be other services offered by Registry at some future point. 
These will include a newsletter for Rave Professionals, a party
registration scheduler to help promoters from throwing parties on a
conflicting date, a free/underground party contact service (offered for
free), and whatever else is needed to help this community thrive. 

If you are a DJ and/or wish to be listed with this service, please 
contact me directly at anarchy@eng.umd.edu.  There is a form at the end 
of this message for the service that should be completed to be listed.

Okay, this form may seem a bit thorough, but I feel most of the 
information is necessary.  The names, locations, musical styles and 
history may be printed in a list that will be given to promoters but most

Subject: The Greening of America
Status: 

upon the recommendation of a trusted advisor, i recently got a copy of *The  
Greening of America* (Charles A. Reich, Random House, 1970) at a used  
bookstore and have been taking it in at a slow but steady rate.  aside from  
the infrequent references to artifacts of 60s culture (e.g. bellbottoms) and a  
few dated points of word usage, this work seems still to have great  
applicability.  following is a sample.  the term "Consciousness III" is  
defined at length earlier in the book; for now you can probably just think of  
it as the rave mindset/philosophy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p 318-321:
   The task of the new generation is to be the teachers of their fellow men  
and women, so that the great liberating process of recovery of self, started  
by our youth, can become the means of liberation for all Americans; and so  
that the domination of self by false goals and false consciousness may be  
ended for all Americans.  When the self is recovered, the power of the  
Corporate State will be ended, as miraculously as a kiss breaks a witch's evil  
enchantment.  [...]
   This task does not demand missionary aggressiveness, zeal, and  
self-sacrifice.  Nothing could be further from the spirit of Consciousness  
III.  The most important *means* of conversion is, and will continue to be,  
simply living one's own life according to one's own needs.  Direct efforts at  
proselytizing, on the other hand, are all too likely to involve  
depersonalization and a loss of consciousness for both parties.  But without  
going to that extreme, we have tried to suggest an attitude of openness for  
the new generation to replace what often has the appearance of hostility  
toward outsiders and rejection of them.  Consciousness III will never convert  
anyone by abandoning its own life-style in order to become ideologists,  
pamphleteers, and propagandists.  But it can understand the possibilities of  
conversion in others, and it can live its own life in such a way as to help  
others to join.
   To live in this way requires, before anything else, a rejection of  
hostility - even hostility toward those who are the outspoken opponents of  
change.  Any efforts by the new generation to raise consciousness in others  
must be accompanied not by a hostile, threatening, or rejecting stance, but by  
a demonstrated offer of acceptance and affection.  We know that the greatest  
thing holding back most people is fear - fear and the lack of a significant  
group to join on the other side.  If youth presents itself as a closed  
society, contemptuous of older, "straighter" or less well educated people,  
those who want to make a change will find that the most crucial encouragement  
of all is lacking - the promise of support and acceptance bythose who have  
gone ahead.  But when changes that affect their lives as sought for by the  
radicals of the new generation, there will be the potential for a growth of  
trust, understanding, appreciation and solidarity between the new generation  
and the middle class.  For the new generation will be visibly helping the  
middle class, not threatening them.  There is already evidence that when young  
people join hands in a cause that workers understand, they are welcomed.
   The student radical of today [1070] is all too likely to call policemen  
"pigs,", to be scornful of "straight" people and "uptight" people, to call  
right-wingers and George Wallace supporters "fascists," to be harshly critical  
of his own parenbts and their contemporaries.  In doing this, students are  
reacting naturally to the anger and violence and lack of understanding  
directed at them, but they are nevertheless making the same mistake as those  
who are radical or religious bigots.  Look again at a "fascist" - tight  
lipped, tense, crew cut, correctly dressed, church-going, an American flag on  
his car window, a hostile eye for communists, youth, and blacks,  He has had  
very little of love, or poetry, or music or nature, or joy.  He has been  
dominated by fear.   He as been condemned to narrow-minded prejudice, to a  
self-defeating materialism, to a lonely suspicion of his fellow men.  He is  
angry, envious, bitter, self-hating.  He ravages his own environment.  He has  
fled all his life from consciousness and responsibility.  He is turned against  
his own nature; in his agony he has recoiled upon himself.  He is what the  
machine left after it had its way.
  The task of the new generation is to see the humanity in all men, and to  
work for the renewal, the rebirth, the return to life, of all men ["people"  
-rnj].  The new generation must bridge the gap that separates parents from  
children, and the still greater gaps that separate worker from student,  
white-collar professional from those who are young and liberated.  They must  
realize that "youth" is not chronological age, but the state of growing,  
learning, and changing, and that all people must be helped to regain the  
condition of youth.  The new generation must make their revolution by the  
yeast theory; they must spread their life.
  Those who ahve the good fortune to have attained Consciousness III must  
teach others where their true interests lie - not in getting a promotion, or  
in fighting communism, but in directions that will enrich their lives.  The   
students may set an example simply by changing their own lives, or they may  
take jobs in the Establishment and educate from there, or they may fight for  
particular issues, or create culture; the means are unlimited, but the object  
must be to reach people.  Consciousness III starts with an assumption of  
responsibility for oneself and one's community; now our young people must take  
another step and assume responsibility for their parents, their college  
teachers, their younger brothers and sisters, and on outward into society, to  
all those who seem to be enemies but are only the deceived, the broken, and  
the lost.

This is why it is VERY IMPORTANT to support private cryptographic programs
like PGP.    If enough people use it,   then it is highly unlikeley that
it will become illegal.    Even if it ever becomes illegal,   it would be
almost impossible to enforce it.

On another note...   I read in the paper this morning that Grateful Dead
promoters were going to clamp down on the festivities in the parking lot.
Then I see a posting in SFRaves that it might include the Atomic Dog rave.
Is this true?    Will the Atomic Dog still take place?

Full moon Rave report
=====================

Rain was in the forcast all evening,   and I was watching the weather
reports ver carefully,  as the sattelite photoes were showing the tail
edge of a big storm stomping through the North West.    Here in Marin,
it has already started to rain,   and J' Prime,   my friend from LA
had called and said he was about 250 miles from me,   and estimated
to arrive around 12:30.     Sheesh!!  And we were preparing for this
ocassion for so long....

I Called Phil,  one of the most dedicated SFRavers to insure that he
calls me when the location was to be announced,   as always,  it is 
word of mouth and NEVER posted to SFRaves.

My phone starting ringing constantly,   from about 10:30 on,  as
my friends,  and many people I don't even know are starting to call,
asking where it was to be located.

J' Prime finally arrived at 12:45,   and I was finishing up with my
yoga exercises,   showered and was ready to leave about 2:30 am.

From where I live,  it's about a 2 hour drive down to Bonny Dune

We finally arrive at Bonny Dune about 4:30 AM,   and surprising 
enough,  there were lots of cars parked along the road (A very good
sign).    There was also a police cruiser parked there as well,
but un-occupied.    We couldn't hear the music,   but with the layout
of Bonny Dune,  that was to be expected,  because it is a small bay,
about 700-1000 feet wide,  and steep high cliffs all around it,  with
a steep and narrow pathway down to the beach.   When we arrived,  the
music hadn't started yet,   so we hastily constructed our "lean to"
during a time when the rain stopped.  I never did find the cop,  but
assumed he probably left.

I get word that Garth hadn't arrived yet,   and eventually the first sounds
started as Markey Mark took to the turntables.    There was a great shelter
protecting the DJ stand,   and just as the music started,   about a half
hour later,  it started to rain again,   but by that time,  everyone
didn't even care about the rain,  because it was rather warm (about 55 -
60),   about perfect for dancing.

Both Markey and Jeno layed down the tranciest set I've heard since the
last Gathering,  and I only stopped dancing long enough to cool down
a tad.   Not even ther rain was enough to cool me down,  besides I
wanted to stay as dry as possible,  and found a great place under
cover just in front of the DJ stand.    Sheesh!  after all this preparation,
I Forgot to bring a set of dry clothes.

The rain didn't dampen the spirits of us ravers in the least,   as about
several hundred dedicated ravers were out there,  dancing,  sitting by the
fires,   and digging the whole scene.

I din't remember when the music stopped,   but was dissapointed that Jeno
was too tired to carry on some more,    but it was really raining hard,  and
lots of people were leaving,  so we eventually packed up our stuff,  and
headed for our car and headed back north.

This was an incredable experience for me and everyone who attended this
gathering dispite the rain.    And I'm sure lookin forward to another
outdoor gathering soon...

Due to lack of funds,   I couldn't make the "the Green X and Ham ball"
happening this Saturday,  so I'll attend Spundae tonight,  and possibly
Atomic Dog at the Grateful Dead show's parking lot this evening if it
ever comes off.

Keep the Scene alive...

Aside from the fmrs, which have been starting *real* late, I have not seen
any flakiness on the side of the wicked posse when they have other events

I'd venture to say things will be fine -I wasn't able to make it last
night, but I did share a Bart train on my ride home from Berkeley with
people who had gone to the show, and according to them the parking lot
scene was still big (vendors and all, just no overnight camping).  I

whoa!
on 26-feb, at 10 pm, Temptronic Faith exploded in Ithaca New York.  The
event was held at a plush theatre, and there was no alcohol allowed, and
no smokin allowed in the dancing area.  the place stayed clean and the
participants were a mixed bunch of ravers and clubbers from the area.

some people came from NYC (5 hours away), Baltimore (a bunch more hours
away), and Buffalo (3 hours away).\

DJs were Adam X (Brooklyn):  Trance, House, Acid, Hardcore
Heather Heart (Under One Sky):  House, Trance
Soul Slinger (Liquid Sky):  Acid, Trance, House, Breakbeat (slower stuff)
Brian Walters (Wax Trax Records):  Acid, Trance, House
Wilhelm (Sunshine/Exit 23):  House, Trance, Retro/Classics
R.M. (Syracuse):  House, Trance, Acid

all the DJs played progressive house music, but i didn't want to take up
too much space, and be redundant....

the lights were beautful Intellibeams, a big video projection, and some
powerful strobes up front.  i enjoyed the smoke machine, but at times, there
was a complete "whiteout", and you couldn't see an inch infront of your
face.

highlights:
...Wilhelm mixed the intro from Dominator with a few highly acidic rhythms
and it sounded cool.
...Adam X spun some beautiful 12" singles:  one of them was a green, trans-
parent, glow-in-the-dark record, cool!
...The crowd was very friendly, no fights, no hassles
...Security was friendly, no hassles
...No alcohol allowed... the place was VERY CLEAN, almost spotless
...No smoking allowed in dancing area.
...A cool chick was giving away Instinct casette tapes with some great stuff
on them.
...Smart drinks were tasty and refreshing.
...My friends and i didn't want to leave, i yelled to wilhelm  "We'll leave
when the music stops!" and there were four people on the floor, so he cut the
music and said, "thanks for coming, but we have to cut this now"
...Sound system was great, not too loud, just perfect!
...Music was non-stop and everything flowed well.
...My friend locked his keys in his car, so we had to stay at a diner for
2 hours and wait to open the car.
...Damn! it was cold outside!
...No cheesy house, just good stuff
...No gabberhouse (sniffle, cry, sigh)
...No cheesy breakbeats, just good stuff
...No weak-ass, wise-ass, "breakthrough" bullshit, like playing Pink Floyd,
or playing pre-techno "yeah, i like ths stuff so i'lll play it at a rave
and be cool" occured.
...No ambient, except when people were walking in!!! (YAYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!)

overall, i had a blast, the average bpms were 130, and some songs pushed it
to 175.

UP-tempo!!!
the east coast says bye!

I meant, how does anyone know that the FBI badge flashes on the screen?  
Has that actually happened to someone?  Is it an ASCII representation of 
the badge?  Why do they give you that warning and time to run?

I bet this is somebodies Idea of a joke, if you set your xserver

to receive connections from anybody it is not hard to send the image of
a FBI badge to the screen, the program is very trivial to write.  The hard
part is to get the permissions to write to the person's X server.

I'm usually very lazy in writing reviews because most of the time people

Also this time I really don't have anything more to add to the wonderfull

from the top of the cliffs I promise myself that I had to write about it 
and tell everybody else to come next time: IT IS WORTH IT.

It was great to spend such a wondeful morning (despite the rain) with you all:

Hello All,

I usually don't post to this group, but I feel
it necessary to share my views about last
saturday's FMR.

We made it to Bonnie Dunne around 3:00 the
weather was dreary and I wondered what the hell
I was getting my self into- a cold??
When I catch a 'cold' it takes me weeks to
get rid of them....

At that time there were several young chaps
about guzzling Ole 8, and sucking on balloons.
I don't have anything against the young,
though some of them seem to be a tad bit on
the rowdy side.
-Though I did see some fine young ones!!! :^)

Anyway me and my friends decided to tuff'it 
out since we drove a ways to get there.

Let me tell you, hang'g on the beach in the
wee hours of the morning is the COOLEST
thing to do.  Besides the fact, BD Beach is
absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!

FINALLY, Markie came on and then EVERYTHING
WAS ALRIGHT!!!  Markie impressed me again
and I danced and floated around the beach with
the BEST space: fresh air, lovely atmosphere,
happy, happy, happy!!!

That was my first FMR, the crowd (many of
the other folks bailed out earlier) was in
good spirits and I caught many warm,
happy smiles...

A definate -Thumbs UP!!!!
It was worth the wait..

peace to G&B and Everyone!!

We at Mother Earth Sound System need some help!  We're in the last two 
weeks of organizing for KINDNESS, and we're looking for the following 
hearty souls to help us in this worthy cause:

1. COAT CHECK
2. DOOR 
3. PETITION TABLE

Doing any of the above will certainly get you in for free, plus all 
those perks that come with the work (remember what this party s 
benefitting ;)

4. SMART BAR
5. VISUALS
6. SECURITY

If you or someone you know of does any of the above stuff, please contact 
us.  We'll be very grateful and if the party goes off, there will be 
some $ in it for you.

Lastly, although we're finalizing plans on space and sound, if you have 
any hot info on locations (especially a 400+ person warehouse) or cheap/free 
sound equip., please get in touch with us!

If you can't help out with any of the above stuff, you most definitely 
can contribute in another, more simple way: come to the party, sign the 
California Hemp Initiative, and get down with us at this kind :) event!!!
See you there!

Peace & Respect...

i didn't go to the aforementioned event
because i didn't have enough devotion
to go all the way to santa cruz from
berkeley. however, i totally caught the
'loving feeling' that geoff described
at the only full moon i went to, one
year ago, and i have never felt that 
kind of bond at any other raves. it's
special.

Status: 


There isn't much I can add that hasn't been said already, especially by Geoff.  
So what can I say ?  A few personal observations and vignettes to try and 
communicate how good it was for me and my pals...

I picked up my friends Thad and Derek in Milpitas and together we drove to the 
location, which I was assured was the right one this time.  We didn't get there 
until 2:30am, I though we would be about on time for the start.  In fact we 
were way too early, or else Wicked were way too late.  Who cares, the party
happened and thats all I wanted !

In any event, me, Derek, Thad, Eric, Jason, Adam and all the rest of our 
extended loosly connected group (me being the only sfraves contributor) just 
kindof hung around on the railroad sleepers, sharing umbrellas and rumours, 
talking about recently purchased vinyl, recording deals, music made and so on.

We eventually moved down to the beach and hung around one of the big fires 
that had been started.  There was a sense of expectation, despite the constant 
gentle rain.  Some people got bored and amused themselves.  There was a 
bunch of spacers, must've been 8 or more, who all stood at the top of
the incline leading down to the beach.  Then each lit a hand-held sparkler,
they were all different colours, then they all ran down the sandy hill, twirling
their sparklers, changing diection as they ran, whooping all the time.
What a sight !  It made me think that for those who were chemically-attentuated, 
it must've been either a daunting or a magnificent sight !

Personally I didnt mind the rain at all.  Everything has its place, this is 
California's winter and I think it's a bit much of me to ask for the rain 
to stop so I can have my bit of fun.  Being a bit of a rain-person, I kind of
liked it anyway.  And besides, I'm used to seeing rain cominatcha all horizontal,
at high velocity in the teeth of a gale, so for me this was childs play.
The rain is as much a part of the seasons as the sun and I dont resent it 
happening when it does.  I was also buoyed by the fact that I'd been assured it 
would take a steady downpour before Wicked would call the party off.

So we waited and eventually we saw in the gloom (cloudy, not much moonlight) 
that a small protecive canopy had been setup.  I went back up to my car and got 
a flashlight to shine on the electrical components and so aid in the rig setup.  
The system was assembled in double quick time.  It was a laugh, Allan from Wicked 
came strolling down the incline and over to the sound-system under the tarp 
(provided not by the posse but by one of the partygoers) and he exclaims 
"Look at this canopy !  Wicked !!!".  Said as it was with the accent and all,
it's something that'll stick in my mind !

So the system was protected and ready to go.  Unfortunately, Garth had gone off 
somewhere and it was a further 30 minutes before tunes emerged from the stacks.
I loved the way it started, there was a vert trancy, soft, gentle, repetitive and 
simple sound played over the system for about 40 seconds, very gradually
building in volume,  announcing to everybody that the event was about to begin, 
and then, ... *pow*, up went the volume, the bass started thumping and 
we were off !  As the volume built slowly, people had left the fires and 
congregated in front of the stacks, and when that first track opened up, people 
started dancing and cheering.

So on went the night, after this 5:30am start.  It started to rain again about 
7am, this time a little heavier but again, I could care less, the event was on and 
that was all I wanted.

Me and my pals had a great time, I met a few people I'd never met before from 
Santa Cruz, I had a great chat with a woman from Japan/New York who is studying
there, nothing to do with dance music at all.  I went for a nice walk on the 
cliff top when it got brighter, saw the blossoming bright yellow rape seed 
flowers on the plateau above the beach and sea.  Spring in California.  
All the time, great music boomed up from the beach.

By 9:30am, there were few of us left.  Some of my friends had to leave, to go to 
work, and by then most everyone who was left I knew personally, or had a nodding 
acquaintance with, or at least knew to see.  Which all added to the sense of 
community.  There was a sense of camaraderie from being among the group who'd 
stuck it out and had a great time despite the inclement weather.  In fact the 
weather heightened rather than interfered with this sense.  My friends Andrew and 
Brian had brought two big big containers of orange juice with them, they
set these up on the speaker stacks for anyone who wanted a drink.

By now, Jeno was playing one hell of a good set, and he finished up the party 
at 10:30am in great style.  All in all, another one in the back of the net 
for Wicked.  Each of my friends who went, some to the FM for the first
time, some to their first beach FM, all agreed it was outta sight !

Later,

Pk.

Atomic Dog review
=================

This is one of my first Atomic Dog raves,  and I have to say,  I really
enjoyed myself.    Susan pumped out some really trippy stuff,   and
Ethan always comes up with the most amazing selection of music I have
ever heard.   Sheesh!!  Where does he get those great records...

On the way to the E. Bay,  I tried to tune in Radio Free Berkeley,
and as I was just coming off the San Rafael Bridge,   I could pick
up the UC Santa Cruz station on 89.1,  but as I approached around
that hill in North Berkeley,  it actually started to come in,  very
spotty until we got to about University Ave exit,  then it started
to come in pretty solid.   According to the signal contour,  it
appears the location is somewhere in Oakland or south Berkely,  as
I got the station all the way to the Oakland Colisium.

They were playing a song where someone was singinn "Drugs, Drugs,
Drugs< to housey tunes,   then faded to some familiar housey sounds.
Then the announcer said where he got the records,   I think from
Rasputans,  then he said he wasn't going to announce the names,  and
told the listeners to figure out for themselves what he played.   But
mentioned which record stores had the records.    I don't know who
the announcer was,   but it sounded like Steve Dunnifer.   But I COULD be
wrong.    The Modulation was very good,  and the audio was exceptional
for a pirate station.    We really were entertained while on our way
to Atomic Dog.    When we got there,   we turned LEFT instead of going
into the colisium parking area,  but went down a side road,  then
decided to go back (Wrong way on a one-way street,  then at the
end of the street,  a cop car pulled up and politely shined his spotlight
on the "One-way" sign.    We have a "Thumbs up" to the cop,  and he
acknowledged us,  as we turned around and parked our car.    Then as
we headed into ther parking area,  it was obvious to us where it was.

We had a great time,  then after that,  we went to Spundae,  and had 
another great time,   dancing until about 6 am.    Then went about our
business on Monday after that.     

Cheers

Subject: The Old Bill continues the clampdown
Status: 


transcripted from The Guardian, London, Monday 21 February 1994.

	Party raided as it prepares to fight for right to rave
		by Duncan Campbell, Crime Correspondent

 A party claiming to represent ravers and the organisers of sound systems
has been formed to campaign against the provisions of the Criminal 
Justice Bill that would outlaw rave parties.  But police raided a 
fund-raising party for the new group in Islington, north London at 3am 
on Saturday after complaints about noise.  Four people were arrested after 
an officer had been struck by a missile.  

 Michelle Poole of the Advance Party said "They're implementing the bill 
before it's become an Act."  This week the Advance Party will be launching 
it's own newsletter and producing "rights cards" to be issued to rave-goers,
giving them instructions on what to do at police road blocks, on arrest and 
on confiscation of sound rigs.  The party was formed after a meeting of 
people who had been involved in arrests or cancellations of parties over 
the last two years.  "We want to bring to public attention the fact that
it will be illegal for more than 10 people to gather in a public place if the
police believe they may or may not be planning a rave," Debby Staunton, a party
co-ordinator, said.  "It could even apply to people wanting to have a picnic."

 She said support for the party had come from all over the country.  They had 
members in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Derby, Birmingham, Norfolk and the West country 
as well as in London and the South-east.  The organisers of more than 50 
sound-systems, many of whom have had equipment confiscated by police, are 
members.  The party's aim is to campaign against legislation aimed at rave 
parties and travellers, in particular the new provisions of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Order Bill.  They are collecting the experiences of 
individuals who have been arrested at raves and are planning protests against 
the bill.  Accounts will be published in it's newsletter.  "There have been 
many incidents which have never been reported", said Ms. Staunton, who lives 
in north London and says she became involved because of the experience of her 
friends in Spiral Tribe, one of the party organisers.  "In Acton, west London, 
in Easter 1992, the police made everyone lie on their faces on a soaking 
concrete floor, 50 people were injured and one man had his leg broken."  

 The Advance Party was working with Charter 88, Liberty and other groups 
involved in opposing the Bill, she said.  Another group, Friends and Families of 
Travellers, has also been founded to fight the bill, which will extend police 
powers for evictions from land and repeal the 1968 Caravan Sites Act, which 
laid a duty on local authorities to provide sites for travellers.

What can people do about the parking tickets that I assume everyone got 
from parking overnight.  When I saw the "NO PARKING" sign, it painted and 
just said "PARKING" on it.  Does anyone think that's enough reason to go 
fight the ticket?  (It's only $13.00 but rather not pay..)

It was a great experience for me.  It was my first FMM and I can't 
believe how much fun I had.  It was more than fun but I don't have the 
words.  I met a lot of great people who were dancing in the rain.  For 
some reason, I enjoyed the light drizzle on my face as I danced.  I'm 
glad it rained..

There are stretches down Bonny Doon road which are okay to park in.
If those are filled up, at least try and park where you're not causing
a road hazard (i.e., not along highway 1 where there's NOT a turnout,
not at the intersection of BD road and the 1, etc.)  

But more fundamentally, look at it this way.  $13 split among 5 people
is cheaper than any rave I've ever been to.  $13 has seemed to become the
de-facto way to essentially "pay back" the local police - they make a ton
of money charging a per-car admission, and we get our party unfettered.
I think this is a more than adequate payment. :)

I say render unto cesar what is cesar's.  I personally pay my Bonny Doon
tickets because they are only $13.00 and $13.00 is nothing to pay for
an experience like Bonny Doon.  If a few parking tickets keeps the 
county from hassleing us, I say fine.

I'm glad you liked it. I'd say pay your ticket.

You know, the way I figure the least we can do is give a 
little revenue to the community that has been letting us have these 
parties there undisturbed now for a long time.  And $13 isn't
anything compared to the sf parking ticket rates.  When out with
friends and we realize that we must park in a ticketable area
we agree to split the money on a ticket and write it off as
a pleasure expense!  And as far as Bonny Doon is concerned there
are signs *everywhere* I doubt you'll be able to get the ticket
cleared.  

Take care,
