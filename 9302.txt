Subject: come/unity was great but I'm totally deaf now.... // wicked


Anybody have the mail-order address for those audiophile ear-plugs. i
ended up pulling out my foam jobbies cuz' I couldn't hear the groove,
nor the sound made by a love-phaser on overload. (But Jim, I'm dancing
as fast as I can, i canna dance no faster!) And now I'm completely
deaf.

And what is this with mega soundsystems. it's like the past few months
have humongified every speaker stack in town, esp. 174 King St, 1015
Folsom, Sound Factory, Townsend, etc. Ouch Ouch Ouch.  Hurt me some
more. I think the ear-killer is the "flying tweeter" that they seem to
be putting over the  dance floor -- raining down pain unto our brains.

Good seeing the sfraves posse out in force. Def a fun come/unity,
better than some of the previous one's i've been to. 

To tell, you the truth, though, I thought the Wicked in the Bassment of
1015 last friday rocked harder than come/unity. More intimate, more
fun. It was, in my opinion, just on the verge of crowded. Lots of
spleef being  passed around on the dance floor. Garth redeemed himself
by playing the kind of garth-music i like (ala Vision). My kinda party.
Not a whole lot of sfravers there for some reason.

W'hell, I'm ravercised out after an evening of enduro-dancing on smart
drinks and cappucino.

Subject: Re: Come/Unity


So, shouts out to Pat Dote from this sfraver, who pulled off
of 280 around the 380 interchange to hang out at the 7-11.
I attached some wire to my sheared-off antenna and managed to
pull in KZSU for the half hour or so it took me to down my
coffee and Hostess cupcakes.  

I was really getting into this Come/Unity, certainly much
more so than the last one I was at... the chill space was
excellent, and Garth was sounding great to my relatively
undiscriminating ears.  I wound up putting in most of my
dancing time up on the stage to try and (a) get away from
the crowd and (b) cut down on the volume without resorting
to ear plugs.

Seemed like it was a decent crowd there, though there was a
fair amount of the paranoid don't-talk-to-strangers
invisibility treatment going on... at least earlier in the
evening.  Takes people a while to warm up, I guess, even at
Come/Unity. 

Someone came up to me, who recognized me as "the guy who
held the after party for Caffiend".  

Some minor complaints (I always have a few):  

Sometime after checking my coat, I went back to get some
sfraves flyers out of the pocket.  I figured I'd throw some
money in the tip jar for the hassle.  I was informed that
the *first* time you ask for something out of your coat,
it's free, but the second time they charge you a dollar.
Apparently the idea is to encourage you to get everything at
once and go leave them alone.  I've never heard of this
policy before.  It's not like the coat check counter was
busy.  I skipped throwing money in the tip jar.

Around 11:30, I'm pretty sure they had some space heaters
cranked up.  These were behind grills on the wall behind the
stage.  Stupidity or malice?  Stupid malice?  You decide. 

I was talking with the woman trying to promote the Benefit
rave on friday.  She seemed reasonable, and the more I
thought about it, the weirder it seemed that there aren't
more charity/benefit raves.  This one is for the Berkeley
Free Clinic, and the main attraction seems to be the
Hardkisses, but there are some other intriguing things on
the flier like "the digipoets".  If whatever else you were
thinking about on Friday should happen to fall through, this
could be the place to be.  According to the info number,
this is at the Villa (?) Gallery, 2648 Third St, four blocks
north of Army Street.  They say it's 21+ (which I will
probably never understand.  No alcohol! Can't they get their
act together to sell some hot dogs and make it at least
18+?).

I think it is sad that all raves aren't donating the majority of their profits 
to different charities.  This seems essential if raves are going to ever be more
than decadent drug/dance parties for rich high school and college students.

It seems to me that sfraves should take the lead and use whatever influence it
has to promote benefit raves and make all others unacceptable.

Raves are very commercial - while reading SFWeekly the other day I noticed
all of the 1-900-555-RAVE info line ads in the back (only $2.50/min !!). 
I thought this was pretty bad.

Now I also think that a lot (most?) of the people going to raves want nothing
more than a good time.  I don't know if raves will ever become a tool for
genuine social and political change.  Having a good time is fairly noble bla 
bla bla bla . . . 

Anyway, I guess I just see potential for something better.

Well, I like them both, personally I used to think that Garth was the ultimate
and Jeno was real good but then at one comeunity. I saw why Garth says that
he looks up to Jeno.  This ComeUnity was particularly difficult, a lot of 
attitude/ no dancing/standing around/I'm so beautiful/ crowd came that night.
Try as he may, Garth could really get this crowd moving, people danced but
there was entirely too much attitude.  By 4 am the vibe had not caught on and
I was indeed worried, If GArth couldn't pop this crowd who could?
Enter Jeno.  I had been used to Jeno going on first followed by Garth,
this was a twist but you know what I realized? Garth is a supurb trance DJ
maybe the best, but Jeno is the best all-around DJ for any situation.
If my life were up for ransome in a battle of DJ's I would hope Jeno was
spinning for me.  Jeno comes in ( and I hear that he loves, these type of
crowds and considers them a challenge) and starts throwing on this incredible
tribal-trance stuff that is kicking as but thes guys are still not dancing
but Jeno is the most relentless and cool DJ that I know, In fact, he's not a DJ
or a Brain Surgeon, he's a fucking psychiatrist, so he decides to maul 'em
a little with some intense acid house and then rolls into that dark/sinister
murky/power techo that he keeps in a special jar for such ocasions.  He pounded
them with this stuff untill their ego's were pulverized then back to the most
intense trance-tribal I ever heard and the chill-out area emptied...
EVERYONE was dancing, although it was about 6:30 by this time and only 
a half hour to go.  When 7:00 came the crowd didn't want to let him leave!

What is the moral  of all of this? Well Garth IS a good DJ but Jeno is
the Master.  He is more versitile than Garth is and has an almost uncanny
sense of the crowd.

Hi.  There were rumors of problems caused seemingly by the very
receipt of my mail split instructions, not with the instructions
themselves.

I do use RMAIL, I sent that message to myself also,  and there
was a distinct lack of confusion on the part of RMAIL and
absolutely no problems with reading, saving, or anythinging mail.
It seems particularly odd that a program that needs a certain ascii
sequence as a header would look anywhere other than the head of a
file for it, and would thus not be robust enough to allow any sort
of text being sent or read through it.

For the love of Dog, were there any other people out there who had a
similar problem?  Please let me know directly; if so I will revise the
instructions.

I wondered about those, too, last time I was at Product (Ggreg Taylor's
extravaganza on Saturdays at 1015 Folsom).  Turns out that they are
Intellibeams mounted vertically, set in the wall with the mirror on the floor
end.  It makes for some cool effects with the light shining up and out through
the people dancing on the stage.  The heat is just the exhaust fan blowin'.

 Well, it's 6:30AM Thursday, and I'm awaking up instead of drowsing off - same
kind of twilight feel to it, though!

 I have mixed feelings about my first Come/Unity, but mostly positive. I don't
don't like the degree of crowd density that was in effect most of the night - 
too much bumping into people. Also, the dancefloor is such that people have 
to cut across the dancefloor to get to the other rooms, which was also 
distracting to me as I danced.

 Negative points aside, I really enjoyed it! Nice to see so many SFRaver
folks there, and it was nice to meet new ones as well . Garth is definitely
getting to be a DJ I look forward to. Who was the guy who closed ? Carlos
was all over the dancefloor, doing a bit of cheerleading at especially
intense moments of Garth's set. 

 Nice video in the chill space. Interesting "shrine" w/ candles and herbs,
etc. put up by Geoff and ?. The club could have sold some candy, as well
as drinks, but I brought my Lifesavers (tm), so I was OK. Thumbs up to 
them for the free water, and no frisking or backpack inspection ( hmmm, maybe
I can sneak in my anti-tank gun next time...).

 I've never seen or noticed colored strobes before - is 1015 Folsom the 
only club, or is it pretty common?

mail handling: If it is the case that no one else had any problem with
the mail handling stuff and RMAIL, I'd like to offer a public apology
to nineball.

All I know is that I definitely had major problems which seemed to be
the result of the message in question, which continuously spliced
itself to the end of the last message already in my RMAIL file, and
wouldn't let itself be deleted -- and I couldn't get any messages
after the message in question because RMAIL was having problems
parsing.  (Speaking of problems with parsing, I'm not sure that last
sentence does :-)

Come/Unity: my first, enjoyed the hell out of it.  Met Larry and ran
into Laurel (from the yosemite trip), saw Lee Fogel and hung out with
Derek Chung a bit... was introduced to about a half dozen other people
but I spaced on names.  Extremely strong strong strong dancing
frenzy/energy, I've never seen a crowd so dense and so pumped up in
any space.  I also (sorry, Niels) thought the PA was excellent, plenty
of bass without it being ** excessively ** loud -- the whole place was
filled with music without there being any extremely loud spots, IMHO.
I got in at 11:30, started dancing by 12, didn't stop to find out the
time until 2:30, chilled a bit, decided to go out for one more
session... and ended up leaving exhausted at 4:30.  Great time.
Looking forward to the next one, especially now that my Wednesday
meeting has been moved from 11 AM to 1 PM ;-} DJs: who was spinning in
the 3am-4am time frame?  He was great!  The DJ(s?) from 12 - 2ish was
(were?) good, but didn't inspire me the way the later guy did.
Probably just a question of musical style... oh, and pretty good
lighting, though I was jaded on it by the end of the night... Nice
space too.

Later on,
Bob

Come/Unity has been "discovered", it didn't use to be that crowded
but, as I have said before, 1993 is the year that the whole world will 
discover raving, so get use to the crowds.  Even though I will miss the
intimate ComeUnity.  If raving becomes big and mainstream, I'd rather have
a 20,000 person ComeUnity than a 20,000 person Cool World.

ASIDE: just thought you should know - that's when i started writing this.

...Yes they WERE just tiles on the floor... NOT the pulsating letters 
on an enormous cyberdeck of the spaceshuttle about to orbit the moon.
But then again who can tell... in that 30 seconds that feels like
30 years when you're sitting on the can waiting for a really great crap!

FLASHBACK:    2nd Feb 1993 - walking down Folsom towards 6th. It's 11pm.

FLASHFORWARD: 11.05 - Entering alley next to 1015 Folsom

...it will later be seen to be extremely ironic that the very first person
(hereafter known as VFP) i spoke to was to be the very same kind being 
that is now the cause of writing this bestranged, bedraggled and certainly 
besotted piece of asciijumble in cyberspace... after spending a fruitless
hour in search of certain illicit substances only to be led full circle back
to this VFP posing in such an innocent disguise.

ASIDE: if u can make sense of that last bit then yr better than me...
but VFP - u know who u r + i thank "U" - please email me asap :-)


REALITY CHECK: 11:25am - somewhere above the cloudline between LA n SF!

ASIDE: this air hostess has just got be a goddess reincarnate... really!

FLASHBACK:    2nd Feb 1993 - midnite and a half after... still no luck!

FLASHFORWARD: 12.40 - alley next to 1015 Folsom. Score 1 double for six!

..."so wots a happening here" did i hear you ask?

well its THE nite of a monthly RAVE called ComeUnity and yours truly 
attended - attired in, the apparently rather pass'e, famous sf brand 
tie-die-swirl - beeboppin to this incessant and rather mellow but o so sweet 
hypnofunk rising pulse segueing repeatedly to ever new complications. 

if u could see me then/now/later after ingesting the best ride of my life!
...dancing - this ain't dancing its flying! i merge with a sea of iridescent
zigz n zagz n zapz n zips all flowing n pounding a rhythm to that 
"just-below-conscious" voice whispering sweet everythings to everybeings'
inner ear n soul. the floor moves - it ain't MY feet its the floor - i notice 
a very alluring ckooooll breeze from the door n sidlebeebop my way over there.
outside the beat continues its throbbb n grind as "the outsiders" grooove
n jive n conversemingle with a mysterious undertow of smiles n yowls. i smoke
then revaporize back into the mainstream muse...

TIMEWARP FACTOR: ok ok i slept for 2 hours so am writing in near normalcy!
                 ...after the fact. Its now 4.20pm wednesday in LA...
                 ie the same day and the megadose of acid is beginning
                 to spiral-wind its way down smooothslip back into...

...the beat just keeps sliding thru its bass penetration / treble-trips n
somersaults and their/her voice re-enters unconsciously urging the throb
to a simultaneous orgasm of movement in color n lite n sound - a flourescent
flow. FLOW - a word which maintains its everpresence intertwining within the 
multi-racial multi-denominational multi-sexual mini-zone of this "youth of
america" living... being... sharing... in a way which could unite the world
if the conservative pressures loosened their grip and truly LET GO to this
groove. a gathering movement of such events DAILY is occuring in anonymous 
venues in innumerable cities worldwide is giving rise to a NEW humanity devoid 
of class n creed barriers in a non-verbal communication of this new "comeunity".

barely able to read with any sense of certainty that the letters forming these
words on the page are transferring intelligibly to convey the writers intended
meaning... i quote >>>

> the last conjunction of outer planets involved Uranus and Jupiter
> ...it was the catalyst for "Summer of Love" in 67 and "Woodstock" in 68.
> ...we are actually learning how to communicate and be with each other
>    in a very special way...

all these words mix with the hitek chillout nonstop video transmogrification
being laid on ever so lovingly by two or three transfixed cybernauts behind a
console belonging to deep-space-nine but appearing as commonplace furniture in 
what has become an ever increasingly techno-aware upwardly conspiring crowd.

the sea of faces smile n nod as one with various shades of tomatojuice eyes
revealing private screenings of ever-unfolding psychedelic mandalas in turn 
conveying a sense that "the power of the universe" is FLOWing thru us all.
UNITE now and forever. 'comeunity' awaits the broader community yet to open
inner eyes n souls to the harmonic fabric interlacing each and every human
interaction into a sister/brotherhood. forgive me if i gush in aquarian
"summeroflove" cliches long since discarded by the youth gone jaded of those
faded years and dreams and aspirations secretly buried lying in wait for
the time of re-emergence. maybe this really IS such a time - politically,
socially - a time when the joys of being young and alive co-join with the
concerns and cares of "responsible" adults weighed down looking for relief.

FLASHFOWARD: the muse of the soul of the rave plays on miraculously in
ways so mysterious its awe inspiring. the pulse of the crowd sighs n moans
n yells in the crest and dip of cybersurfsound anchored only by a bassline
rich in melody n crisp in rib-jabbing massage to sweating bodies jostling
on a dancefloor


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

as i said - its unfinished - theres lotz more to tell and i would like

Subject: ComeUnity Sound

Well I'm a speaker-tweeker and I was a little annoyed that I couldn't
get real close to the bass bins like I normally do but in the morning
I was GLAD cuz my ears were ringing for 5 hours! This is kinda scarey
because I was nowhere near any speaker for most of the night!  In fact
I only danced for the last 3 hours in the main room!  Boy, If those
tweeters were placed anywhere near eye level there would be a lot of deaf
people comming out of 1015 on wednesday morning.

Looking forward to WICKED in the large space at the Townsend complex
on the 20th.  Hope they leave the townsend soundsystem in place, it's
pretty clean and loud.

Subject: Re: Come/Unity

MykL sez that was a good one!

It was a bit claustrophobic, but not as bad as last month.  I'm
happiest with a bit of elbow room too, but I've found that you can usually
find a bit of space somewhere on the floor -- try the area around the rear
right hand corner, near the DJ goldfish bowl (uh, oh, my secret's out now...)

Garth and Jeno were well above average, playing lots of new and/or rare tracks.
Garth was mixing faster than usual (not in the bpm sense, but tracks per
hour) which added to the energy level.  I'm so glad he gave "We Are Phuture"
a miss for once (or if he didn't that I was elsewhere)!

[ My take on the Garth vs. Jeno debate:  I find Jeno to be more consistant,
and the more technically flawless mixer, but Garth can occasionally reach
higher peaks of brilliance, plus I really like his enthusiasm and warmth. ]

The "chill" room was a bit unusual in that the music was far from ambient,
and pretty high energy.  The volume was at a decent conversational level,
though, which wins over blaring "ambient" sounds at 105 dB...

The surprise of the day:  the afterparty (Brickhouse) kicked massively, with
Gavin from Tweakin' laying down a good variety of house and funky techno.
People were still pouring in when we left at 10, on a Wednesday morning no
less!  Only in San Francisco...  BTW, the Underground has one of the cleanest
sound systems of any small club, and lots of fans providing much appreciated
ventilation.

Great to see many of the usual suspects (I'll skip the roll call) but was
sorry to have missed Fred and Randy -- maybe next time.

Next month is the two year anniversary and I'll bet there'll be some special
surprises -- plan early to call in sick!

Subject: Anyone else have problems with mail handling stuff?

yes, your message created problems. When I tried to get into RMAIL
I got a message: file not found  /j/
I found that it had created a file named .newmail in my root and
that was where all the messages that came after yours were. I just
copied the file to rnewmail and deleted .newmail. That fixed it.
I think that if you had put $ in front of all the lines of the
program then that might not have happened. RMAIL got confused.
VERY strange....

About all this unsubscribing: I still do it by hand, which means that I
get to it about once every two days; I let that slip to three this time,
so I apologize to people who still got mail three days after telling me
they want off.  But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE if you want to get off send it to
sfraves-request; I DO get all that mail and process it.  Over the past
YEAR the longest anyone's had to wait to get on or off has been 5 days.
(Jeez, now that I think about it, I can't remember the last time more than
24 hours went by when I didn't log on in one form or another.... :)

  Can anyone out here explain to me why there is so little explanatory information included in techno/rave/ambient/etc. CDs?  I'd like to know something about
who wrote the music, who mixed it, how it came into being, etc.  But in my 
entire collection, the paper inserts that come with the CDs have zero info.
Why is this: lack of interest? Intenional anonymity? $ savings?
  I wish this would change....

While they are certainly not cutting-edge, and also only a few
songs on each are "techno", the Volume series (Volume I, Volume II,
Volume III) each contain a magazine which goes into detail about each
song/band/etc... They've had the Orb and several other pretty popular
technoravechillambienthouse bands featured before.  They tend to focus
on pretty much "alternative" music, though... stuff ranging from New
Order to Lush to Fortran 5 is the most common fare.

They're also expensive, and the mixes aren't the best.  Cool Mag
though.

Subject: This Week's RAVE Guide


        Well, this weekend looks better than last; tonight looks like it'll
be REALLY fun (maybe I should go out.. hmm) with both Deep Faith and Deep 
Space two possibilities.  But all of them tonight are 21+, something which
HAS TO CHANGE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.... :)  
	Friday night has the FMR and the rave for the Berkeley Free Medical
Clinic; the latter has the Hardkisses and is bound to be fun.  
	Saturday has two things I really want to go to: the Future Forum
benefit (help build your friendly neighborhood home for rave culture) and
Groove Kitchen; the latter mainly because Doc Martin is spinning there, and
he was GREAT at Global Rhythm Fest.
	Anyways, whatever you do, play safe!

Subject: Come/Unity = :)

Hey all.  I had the most incredible fun time at Come/Unity, not just because
the music was hot, but because of the near religious experience going to a
Come/Unity was for me.  I have been raving since last July.  Not a long time,
really, but I have been really into the vibe and scene for awhile now, and
am totally and completely comfortable and happy in the scene.  I love it.  But
what made the evening so special for me was that, after running into all of you
and other friends I have, I know that I can go to an event like last evening,
walk in there by myself, and hang out with alot of cool people that I am proud
to call my friends.  We all make the scene together, that's the important part.
It made me realize what a wonderful world we have in raving together; also made
me really appreciate SFRaves a whole lot.  It was great being able to associate
faces with the names, finally!
Also, I am so glad that none of the fun is diminished by going to events
unAltEred.  I had the greatest caffeine/endorphin high all evening!

Anyway, hi to Brian, Mykl, Bob Astroboy, other Bob, Larry, Derek, Niels, Lee,
and Vooddoo Chile, as well as anyone else I have forgotten (sorry, there were
alot of you!).  What an incredible night!

Well, I cannot make it to the FMR, but hope to see all of you soon anyway.

Subject: Listen to your RAID-E-O


For those of you who stay up late (What? RAVERS who stay up late?), I have
a radio show on KALX 90.7 fm (UC Berkeley) which is somewhat regular. 
For the next couple weeks, I will be on early sunday mornings from
3:30-6:00am.  Also, in case anyone gets this message in time, I will be on 
tonight (or rather, tomorrow morning), 330-6am.

KALX is a diverse station, and I try to be a pretty diverse person.  My
shows will hopefully reflect that.  While I do tend to throw in quite a
bit of house/techno type stuff, I am also heavily into
industrial/experimental.  These two categories tend to dominate my show,
but you might also hear hip-hop, jazz, international, among other things.

If you do decide to listen, feel free to give me a call with any comments or
requests.  The number is 642-KALX (642-5259).  Or if you don't call, post
your comments on the net or send them straight to me:   
                        acid23@uclink.berkeley.edu
Last week was the first time I actually attempted to mix (well, matching
beats at least) during my show, so if it sounds a little sloppy, it's
because I'm still learning.  Getting better by the minute, though!!

So, to recap:   "Mescalina" spinning house/techno/ambient/industrial/ 
                 experimental/jazz/hip-hop/or whatever I feel like playing!
                 on KALX 90.7 Sunday mornings 3:30-6:00am
		 Also, tonight! (Feb 5, 330-6am)
                 All comments, requests, suggestions, will be greatly     
                 appreciated: 642-KALX or send to acid23@uclink.berkeley.edu
                 THE BEAT IS INFINITE...

it is conventional all over the list to send un/subscribe requests to the

once in one place without even having to read the list.  When your eyes are
glazing over from reading a hundred posts about nitrous oxide ;) it's easy
to miss that short "unsubscribe" post.

I have heard that there's a "clueless" mailing list, to which people who

such sub/unsub requests forwarded by irate readers of other lists (and
probably unsub requests from readers of clueless!) -- of course, to get off

Ok folks, it is time I start to blab a bit.  Things are finalized, but they
are very close to being so.  We're going to talk to the bank today about the
money we need to borrow for this thing.

We'll be presenting this tour here in Salt Lake City on the 24th of March.  I
know, a Wednesday, but it is spring break.  It will go all night, and it will
be in a warehouse.  I've been talking to Brian about it, and he's considering
renting a motorhome for SFRaves Field Trip II to here.  A few DJs will
probably be imported as well, but I haven't received a schedule or a technical
rider, so I can't say much more than that.  I know the dates after us, on the
25th and 26th are Portland and Seattle.  Has the SF date been announced?  I
didn't even know that Moby was opening for this, but if he is, I'm going to
fight tooth and nail to get the money for this.  The ticket cost will be $13
in advance and $15 at the door.  Probably cheaper than there, but you are
travelling 700 miles for it.  A few other out-of-state netters will probably
be here as well.

hey scott, was bonez in the back room again?  he kix!

and....

on the subject of snowboarding, although i do every other sidestance
sport, i've never been snowboarding. :o   BUT, i am planning to go up
in a few weex with a few (maybe many) friendz.  a lot of us will be
first timers, so if u.r.2 it won't be a big deal. 8) 

also, since there was such a big response to the x c skiing trip, i
figured SFRavers love snow, and there's plenty of it right now.  and
more to come.

so, if anyone iz interested, please let me know.  i know the snowboarding
guyz at sessions and might be able to get a package deal if a bunch of
us were going to rent snowboardz.  

i guess even if you don't want to shred it could be fun just to go up
for a day or two or three and play in the snow.  :)

LIFT last night started out slow; I was there from midnight to
about 1:30, crowd didn't seem to be picking up, and I didn't 
really have the patience last night to wait it out.  Maybe a 
bunch of people showed up later, as is frequently the case.

Anyway, it was a chance to check out the Sound Factory for only
$5, and w/o some of the weekend attitude.  I don't know if all
of it was open for this, but there wasn't anything architecturally
spectacular about it, it's just different.  I probably like
the layout of 1015 Folsom more than any other club in SF.  I 
guess DV8 is kinda cool, but they hardly ever have good events
there.  I really don't like the King Street Garage, even though
they do have some good events there.

for this weekend, but I won't be here.

acid house movement. and the authors are T. Lyttle and M Montagne...
i would post the whole thing cuz it is really well done but it is so long ...so
 expect some exerpts in the next few daze...but here's the abstract...so hit th
e library and go find it...it includes some song listings and pictures of invit
es...
During the summer of 1998, a musical concert experience called acid house
arrived on the cultural scene in many british cities.  The media created a
frenzy of misinformation in the reporting about the latest drug craze.  Acid
house music was then banned from the pop music charts, radio and television,
and retail outlets. Somepsychoactive substances have been bought, sold, and
consumed at Acid House events, but drug use does not appear to be extensive.
At the physiological level, the nature of Acid House music, espeically the
drumming aspect, seems instrumental in providing altered states of consciousnes
s.  At the interpersonal and social level, the set and setting of Acid House
events further enhances and reinforces the specific physiological and
psychological responses.  The degree of acceptance by various subcultural
groups may depend greatly n the amount of media and societal exposure given to
it, particularly if authoritarian attempts to suppress it enhance its political
or ideological aspects.

this is truly the BEST written academic piece written on house music (IMHO)
does anyone else out there have any other academic articals...wow amazing what
you can find at the national institute of health library under
3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine.hmmmm....partyon...susie (:

TECHNO-RAVE RACES TO THE TOP OF TEEN CHARTS

by Andrew Kim ans Irene Takashima

   A bold new type of music is sweeping across California and quickly taking
root in the Bay Area. The age of techno-rave music is here.
   "Techno-rave is a form of Hi-NRG dance music," David Margulies, regional
manager of artists and reperitore for Sony Music, said. "It combinds the
basic disco moves and musical themes of the 1970's with fast-paced rhythms
of the 1980's. Add rap vocals that carry the political sense and style of
the 1990's and you have techno."
   One of the hottest acts is Rozella known for her hit single, "Everybody's
Free to Feel Good)." Her song has been played on Top 40/ dance stations
throughout California. Overseas, Snap literally owned the the United kingdom's
music charts with theirsingle "Rhythm Is a Dancer," while L.A. Style's hit
"James Brown is Dead," is rocking Australia, Italy, holland, belgium, and
Germany, and, according to BLLBOARD newspaper, has become the unofficial
themes song for the techno-rave movement.
   As defined in MONDO 2000, a music magazine, techno-rave is originally from
Europe and is often instrumental and fast paces, at about 120 beats per
minute. [hehehe] Techno also uses rap more then singing and is distinguished
by it aggressive, sometimes dissonant synthesizer riffs, which are dropped
on the top of a frentic house-inflected beat.
   "Techno-rave is big, especially with high school students," Jeff Burks,
a salesperson for Musicland at Stonestown Galleria, said. "Techno appeals
primarily to teens. it's truly their kind of music. A lot of people over the
age of 25 just dont get it, and the kids are buying the records like that."
   "The best sellers are the compilation tapes where singles by different
artists are put on one tape, " a salesperson for Tower Records/Video at
Stonestown said. "Rozella and Smart-E's are also hot." Popular compilation
tapes out on the market today are THIS IS TECHNO, Volume II, featuring such
artists as F-15, Euphoria, and Gravity, and TECHNOSONIC, Volume I, which
features Code Red, RaveBusters, and Fantasia.
   "The best selling techno albums here are by Moby," a salesperson at
Tower Records on Market, said. "Techno-rave accounts for 25% of our daily
sales. We sell about 200-250 techno CD's(including CD singles and albums)
per day." moby is in demand as 12" single remixers.
   Rave itself began in underground clubs in Europe. "Clubs would make
extended remixes of fast beat music and play all night, " Margulies said.
"Kids would go to these all night rave-parties and take 'E' (the drug
Ecstacy) and let themselves get lost in the beat. Soon it became a whole scene
with bright lights and LSD. clubs would sell balloons full of nitrous oxide
(laughing gas) and 'smart drinks' (fruit juice energy drinks pumped up with
sugar and a little 'something else') The house would be jumping all night.
   What really came out of the new "rave scene" was the beat. Mainstream DJ's
would mix samples into the basic beat. "In mainstream it isn't so much drugs
anymore," Marguilies said. "It's all up in the beat. Techno-rave is just
easy to dance to. It makes people really want to move."
   BILLBOARD newspaper compares this new dance music with scene with to the
seventies punk rock movement because many techno-rave artists are not
professional musicians but club DJ's. Club DJ's proved their talent as
keyboardists as well as DJ's by embellishing tracks with live synthesizers.
In reality, many techno acts are just studio creations for a hit in the clubs.
If the record doesn't become hot, the same artist will adopt a new name and
resurface with another recording.
   Although techno has found its way to the United States via the United
Kingdom, Italy,  and Belgium, some of its roots can be traced back to the
Detroit club scene several years ago. According to BILLBOARD newspaper,
techno-rave received exposure in the U.S. when it started to have an impact at
clubs in mid-1991. This led listeners to start requesting techno-rave on the ra
dio. Due to popular demand, many radio stations across the country started
their own techno shows.
   Techno's popularity is growing in LA, Maine, New York, Texas, and Detroit.
Many pop-oriented clubs are instituting techno-only nights [RAVE RAVE RAVE]
while all night raves are becoming a fixture on the West Coast.
   The many Lowellites still up studying at 1:00 a.m. can tune into 106.1
KMEL FM fro samples of techno-rave music. The beat will definately wake you
up.

(damn I hate that term TECHNO-RAVE. What a pain to type in!)

Toques are normally found on longhshoremen.  More recently poularized
by Bob and Doug McKenzie (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) who actually
starred in a full length feature film (circa. 1985) and did, in fact,
sport their toques throughout the film with the exception of one part 
where Doug falls into a massive vat of beer. (probably on video)

Even more recently popularized and recognized as part of the 
"clothing of choice" when raving.

Believe it or not, toques are for some, part of everyday attire in 
Canada; not that people are raving everyday up here (maybe soon :), it's
for more practical reasons: cuz its soo &**%ing cold here ;)  brrrr

I was in highschool?  It sure looks like him.  And that industrialish stuff

Subject: The virtual rave


... has been plagued with problems; some are ones we can fix, others aren't.
(If you're interested and possibly could help, a more exact description of
the problems are below).  Sometimes because of a TCP/IP bug, we are prevented
from re-establishing vrave on the port it was originally on, until either
we find out how to kill the problem or the system re-boots.  So, right now
the virtual rave is on sfraves.stanford.edu, (or 36.73.0.71), at port #
7281.  From now on, if it's not on where we last said it would be, you can
finger bbehlen@soda.berkeley.edu, and it'll tell you where it is.  If I have
another problem with it I may be able to move it back to haas at night or
something...

so n e ways, bear with craig and I, we're working hard to try and fix
the problem.

	Brian




okay, here's the scoop - sometimes the program will just freeze up, without
dumping core or anything... when that happens, craig or I usually just kill
the process from hatever machine it's running on.  After a few minutes,
doing a netstat | grep 7283 shows this:

tcp        0     26  medisg.Stanford..7283  dbootp_exec_25.n.7152  CLOSING

so when we try starting it up again on port 7283, we get this message:

cbd: bind: address in use.

We tried several things, including portions of the code, which normally are
able to close sockets, to no avail.  This happened on haas.berkeley.edu, too,
and even the sysadmin couldn't find a way to close them; the only thing that
did was a reboot.

So we fired it up on port 7282.  The next day, the same thing happened:

tcp        0     69  medisg.Stanford..7282  dbootp_exec_25.n.3295  CLOSING

And now we can't start it up on 7282 either!!!  aarg.  We think we've 
got the hostname that gets cut off there, as exec.niaid.pc.niaid.nih.gov.
I wrote to root there asking for them to close the connections if they can,
and I haven;t heard back from them yet.



So if any of you out there are SunOS4.1.1 whizzes or TCP/IP whizzes, let
Craig or I know what we can do to kill this bugger...

Whoops again.  No Future Forum tonight (due to FMR), none Saturday,
and it won't be next Friday either.  So that leaves two other Fridays

For those of you who are fans of Dr. Fiorella Terenzi and her "music from
the galaxy", you should know that she is/will be a guest and performer on 
the radio show West Coast Weekend. The show is airing live as I am typing
this, but it repeats at 8PM. West Coast Weekend is a two hour variety 
music/chat show on KQED, 88.5 FM, Saturdays live from 11AM to 1PM, with 
a taped re-broadcast from 8PM to 10PM.

I've never heard her stuff myself - I've only read the article in Mondo
2000. I can't tune in now, as I've got to do chores, but I'll be tuning in
tonight to her "acoustic astronomy".

				Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com


PS - To those who called to tell me about FMR, thank you! It turned out that
I didn't get home from my date until 2:30AM - I'm still interested in the 
next one, so please keep me on the list ( I'm willing to call others if
I can stay home the next night. )

PPS - So, how was the FMR? Charter Oak was a lot smaller inside that outward
appearences , but it had a certain "really industrial", informal feel to 
it. Did they open up more dance space than the small back room? Nice upstair
chill spaces.

what can i say - HEAVEN

i must admit that i almost lost faith and hope when i was at charter oaks.
there were so many factors that contributed to that - the price, the 
indoorness, the strange vibe i felt, the fact it got broken up, the way i
felt, some of the attitudes, etc.  i was sad.....until we got to the marina.
                                                                            
i had never been to the marina but last night was a most amazing introduction
to a beautiful place.  the view - unbelievable.  the music was brilliant,    
the people were wonderful (hi to everyone i got to meet.... it was especially
cool to meet some of you in front of the computer at the warehouse =), the   
energy was non-stop, the attitudes were non-existant, it was warm, i was  
happy, and i could go on and on.  i danced last night as i have never danced
before - for at least 4.5 hours, if not 5 or 5.5, straight.  my longest     
break was 15 minutes.  we got there around 4 or 4:30, left after 10 this
morning (i still have not slept), and i danced almost the whole time.  wow.
i couldn't stop.  the music and the people just drove me on and on.  this  
morning, my friends were laughing and saying, "stop! stop!" but i couldn't.
i had sooooo much energy and it kept flowing (especially a wonderful feeling
since i was sober as usual).  this morning i was still going strong, happily
bopping along to the beautiful beats of thomas.  garth spun a brilliant
set, and i was just blown away.  gee, what else can i say.  =)  i was so
happy the entire time, it was amazing.  i met so many great people, all of
them happy and friendly, the god vibe was there in full force, with people
really caring about one another.  the first thing i did when i got there 
was give someone, who needed something to drink, my orange.  i ended up 
getting another from brian.  =)  another really wonderful thing was that
a friend of my friends who i met last night told me he loved me when we
said good-bye because i was such a happy and caring and fun and whatever
else he said person.  it was such a nice, sincere friend to friend "i love
you," and he told me we'd be friends for a long time.  and some other
people i met told me they thought i was a really good dancer and that it
was cool to see a girl go off so much and well.  i felt so great!  i think one 
big big reason it was so delicious for me was that i haven't been that happy
in a long time - lots of problems and mixing emotions have kept me from it.
perhaps not everyone had such an exquisite time, but i can't stress enough
how basically perfect it was for me.  this morning, after the sun came up,
i was sitting on the rocks taking a short break.  i looked out across the
bay at the city and the bridges and everything, and i felt so..... content
and at peace.

and then i went and danced some more.

always,leah

ps - when i typed "god vibe" above, i meant good vibe, but maybe it's
a god vibe too =)

I wasn't sure about making it to the FMR but Sin/Cindy kindly offered
to give me a ride, so we met up on Lombard around midnight and headed
down to Charter Oak.  After only a couple of wrong turns, we arrived
to find it was still very early.  Went inside and found the chill area
in the back where some fine toonz were already afloat.  About ten
minutes later Brian arrived with his PS/1 and started setting up
for VRAVE.  That attracted quite a crowd at times, which was cool
because I got to meet quite a few of ya for the first time, Pat the
Bunny (!), Al, Ken, Leah, Cynthia and more.  Started getting pretty
crowded upstairs until the big sound was set up in the basement.
We could tell it started because the floorboards began vibrating!

But no more than half an hour later the music cut.  I thought at first
it was just a technical problem.  Ever the optimist.  Turns out Brian
was right, we were BUSTED!  First online rave, first online rave bust ;-)

Word got around pretty quick that the Marina would be the next try.
We stopped briefly at the IHOP on University hoping for a mid-night
snack, but never got a table.  Guess it was the International Non-
Happening of Pancakes for us.  Arrived at the Marina around 4, lots
of people milling around the circle at the end of the street, but
no apparent sound system.  Turned out to be about a quarter mile
north, along a path and around a corner.

WHAT A SPOT!  Is this the perfect rave location within the urban
Bay Area or what?!?!  Incredible view, great space, lots of room.
After some fiddling they gradually got  the sound going and then
it was just fiiine.  Wish I'd been able to stay longer, we left
around an hour after things got going, at a point where there was
a brief break in the music.  I was just too tired to go on, my
ankles are still feeling it!  Time to put the moon to bed anyway.
All in all, it was a great adventure last night and it broke my
consecutive string of a year of Friday night washouts.  And with
no advance expectations, I finally got to experience an outdoor
event the way it really should be!

Tonight looks like an excellent night in clubland with Groove Kitchen's
great lineup and the massive at Good Times (at the Troc).  I may try

But last night -- a night to remember, an FMR for the ages.

heh heh..  yeah, it was my first sf rave bust and i STILL haven't even 
been to san francsico..  ;)

hello to anyone i met online last night at the rave..  it was a very 
strange feeling sitting at home in south florida blaring music in my ears 
chatting with people actually in the _act_ of raving!

i could feel the vibe..  really, truthfully.  i COULD feel it.  i guess 
vibes _can_ be pretty strong considering it electronically transcended a 
continent.

and it made me think of something.  what if there were several raves 
online at the same time from different parts of the country?  i could 
very easily hook into the vrave at a real rave down here in south 
florida..  i'm sure others across the country could too..

sure 97% of the time at raves people have other things to do than type on 
a computer, but it could definately be an interesting experiment in
bringing together a national rave community.

brian even mentioned the idea of a big screen tv or a projection of the 
actual online interaction..


not to mention most people wouldn't soon forget the rave they went to 
where they could communicate immediately with several other raves across
the country..

am i totally whacked and crazy for this idea?  well, maybe i'm just 
whacked and crazy anyway, regardless of this idea.

I'd really appreciate a full rundown on what to do
in such circumstances - i was really looking forward to the virtual rave

Subject: FMR and meeting SFRaversfor the 1st time!

Hi everyone!
I guess I should introduce myself since this is my first posting on the net.
I'm ken and I've been raving since last summmer but only subscribed to sfraves
early this year with the help of sfraver Mike Romo and his good friend Oliver.

Getting directions to the FMR was an adventure by itself. The FMR phone line
( I mean info line .) wasn't too informative as to where the FMR was gonna be
located.(I can understand why!)  Thanx to Mike and doom (I got your msg but
by then we had already left for SF.)  

Getting to the FMR wasn't too difficult: thanx to Janet (Brian..Janet wanted
to say hi to you last nite.) she was a great navigator.
The FMR was pretty crowded when we got there but I finally got to meet Brian,
phred, sin/cindy, doom and  a whole bunch of other cool sfravers that I wish
I can remember their names now (Oooppps.. I wish I had a better memory...mebbe
smart drinks can help!) The FMR was happening when the SF cops had nothing
better to do than to go break up the FMR.
Ravers were still hanging around in the charter oaks warehouse when the cops
searched the wareshouse for god-knows-what. The nite wasn't a total fiasco
'cos I finally got to meet sfravers in the flesh (or wet-ware!) You guys are
really cool! It's such an awesome experience finally meeting the people that
you keep hearing and reading about!
There was talk about moving the FMR to the Marina but Janet and I were the onlyu"serious ravers" in our group that wanted to go to the Marina, the others wantedto return to Santa Clara. Since we needed a ride back home, we had to miss the 
FMR at the Marina. 8-( 
I hear the FMR was great(to say the least!) I wished I could have gone now but
I am so glad that night wasn't a total wishout for the rest of you that went
to the relocated FMR. 8-)

The only thing that bugs me now is how did the cops find out about the FMR?!?
I know of so many other ravers  that had a hard time finding out where the FMR
was gonna be held so how did the cops manage to get hold of such information
beats the hell out of me!

Oh well.... hope to meet more sfravers at the next event!

        The Full Moon Rave has reclaimed the title of being, well, at least
the most _interesting_ rave aspect of SF.  I got a call from Mark Metz at
around 8:30; he said the FMR was going to be at Future Forum (I wish I had
hypertext here, so I could link in a similar story about Future Forum, but
to be brief, FF is a place Mark Metz is hoping to get going which will serve
as a home for rave and alternative culture - and the first friday of every 
month is supposed to be our fundraiser to pay the $2000/month rent.  The
manager of the place, Jeff, is a slime however... this is an issue that Mark
NEEDS TO SOLVE before I become more committed to FF.. anyways) and asked if
I could bring my computer.  Mark's a huge fan of cyberculture (or whatever
fancy name you want to lend to online computer networking - I wonder if he's
the one who told Time about e-mail... hmmm) so I thought sure, why not.  So
I brought my computer (er, PS/1... thanks, Leah!  arg :) (are these 
parentheticals annoying?) (I hope not) (because if they are I'll stop)....

        Around midnight it didn't look too crowded, so I thought phew, they
didn't put the location on the Wicked hotline.  I saw lotsa familiar faces,
and when I saw Allen and Garth felt very re-assured that indeed it WAS gonna
happen here.  Apparently there were rumors that it was going to be down at
Bonny Doon; someone said those rumors were to throw the cops off.  Hmm...

        Jeff was at the front door, collecting $10 from every person who
showed up, and turning away people who wouldn't pay.  This was the worst
thing I'd ever seen associated with the Full Moons... for one thing if any
money should be demanded it should be asking for a $5 donation, not demanding
twice that and turning people away.  Second, allowing Jeff to collect the
money directly is abominable, since he's the guy the rent money goes to and
has no interest in reporting the exact amount to Mark.  One of his friends,
beer bottle in hand, also proceeded to let 20 or so people in the back door,
which was also Not Cool (tm).  Aarg.  

        But despite all this I thought the warehouse scene was pretty qool - 
lots of areas to chill, two ripping sound systems, plenty of indoor lighting
effects, and net access!!! Who could ask for more. I felt at home :)  

        So why did the cops bust it?  "Noise Complaints" was their official
word.  Which is bogus, since not a soul lives anywhere close enough to hear 
the sound systems, since they were placed in fairly well isolated places. If
Allen didn't put the location on the FMR phone #, then I think what probably
alerted them was the multitudes of people who were outside the warehouse 
chilling, checking out the moon (dammit it _should_ be outdoors - the second 
fundamental FMR rule broken that night), or who refused to pay the $10.  I
know it wasn't noise complaints, because on other nights there have been two
sound systems going just as loud.

        So the men in blue came in, shone their flashlights everywhere, and
shooed everyone out... the word spread around that it was over to Berkeley
Marina, where it should have been all along ;)

        And I think Leah can pick up the narrative from here; she pretty
accurately describes my feelings about it too (though I was a little more
exhausted due to being up early on Friday morning).  The cops actually took
quite a while to arrive, especially considering the sound was probably twice
as loud as the last FMR there, and I've never heard an FMR sound system that
loud.  There were maybe... 300 people there?  Everyone was so happy to finally
be OUTDOORS, under a FULL MOON, for the first time in 3 months.  The cops 
showed up around 5:30, way later than I would have expected... they stood 
around for awhile, and threatened to tow cars that were parked illegally 
(though I'm not sure if they did).  I talked to one briefly.... she said that
we were all in violation of being in the park during closing hours and could
all be cited.  A little while later she and another officer came out and
checked the locale out, and engaged in a conversation with a few ravers - she
repeated her threat, until she was reminded by one fellow groover, "but the
park opens in 15 minutes!"  She didn't have a reply for THAT one; Mark talked
to her and some others, they radioed their boss, and then turned around and 
walked away, to the cheers of the crowd.

	I stayed until just before the sun rose, and got some great pictures 
of the sun rising on the crowd (now we'll see if they develop.)  I was 
planning to return to see if they had cleaned up after themselves and how bad
the damage to the grass was.  When did it end?  Leah?  There were rumors it
was going to continue until the afternoon... moonpup said he'd play :)

	All in all, the best FMR since... the last one at Berkeley Marina...

I thought it might be that company a few doors down, that had trucks or 
something going on, and some of the cars for the rave were almost blocking
the exit, so they might have called. 

But on the other hand the noise complaint bit must be bogus, as the blankets
in the place muffled just about all sound. 

Did they remove that bit in the Constitution about the right of the people
peaceably to assemble?

i agree, unless Jeff accepts that we (Future Forum) have exclusive use of
the warehouse, without interference from him, in return for paying him a 
fixed rent, this (FF) just isn't going to work.  On the other hand, i think 
we have enough momentum in terms of people involved/interested in the 
collective that we are not bound to this location.  Anyone out there know a 
good warehouse that can be rented on a monthly basis?

Yep, seeing this was definitely a low point for me too.  i also thought that
at most Mark would be at the door seeking $5 dollar donations so Future
Forum could hold onto the warehouse.  i doubt if either Mark or the FMR
organizers were expecting Jeff to take such a, ummm, hands-on approach.
i wish they had decided to move to the Marina as soon as he started doing
this.

i have to admit, i thought the cops were pretty nice about the whole thing.
From what i saw they weren't hassling anybody, just making sure people left.

Yeah, i'm pretty sure the cause of the bust was the people hanging around
outside.  At one point i saw one of the vans from the shuttle business
across the street drive up but pull over to the warehouse instead of into
the shuttle lot.  The guy came in -- whether he talked to anyone in charge
of the FMR i don't know.  But i expect the shuttle place eventually called
the cops -- forty people hanging around outside your business @ 3 AM can be 
somewhat disconcerting.  But considering the pay-or-leave shit Jeff was
pulling @ the door, it's hard to really fault those that hung outside.

Gee, after rereading this, i realize it sounds like i didn't have a very
good time.  WRONG!  It was great.  i was helping set up stuff downstairs for
most of the time @ the warehouse, so i only got to check out the computer
set-up briefly, but vrave was great during a rave -- even the virtual bust 
part.  And i _loved_ the expression on one of the cops' face when he peered 
into a little room and discovered all these people hovering around a computer
:)

Then the Marina.  Ahhhhh.  Incredible moonlight, music, people.  And seeing
everyone and all the colors as the sun came up (this is becoming my favorite
part of outdoor raves).

Finally left around 9 -- how long did it go?

Saw lots of y'all -- i'm even starting to get some of the names right.

Hi everyone, finally, an FMR on a weekend in the city.  I finally got to bring
some rave virgins to show them what I've been talking about for the past year
and a half.  They were a bit disconcerted by the warehouse scene, but soon got
into the right mindset.  But then, sure enough, the cops came.  No one I talked
to knew where it would be moved to.  And due to certain chemical reasons, some
of us decided we had to find dance music *ASAP*.    We could not wait.

Love Factory (successor to Love Garage, which I liked a lot) I had heard was
pretty good, so we made a mad dash to the Sound Factory.  After a couple
hassles getting in, we found the most horrendous crowd immaginable.  Ick. 
They totally threw down the worst vibes.  I just had to close my eyes and try
to forget I was surrounded by big hair and muscle-bound meat heads.  

At least Doc Martin was spinning.  My fave ever since Recess in the summer of
90.  (Was anyone else out in rave-land there for the opening night with the
roller skaters and motorcycle flying around the dance floor, bobbing for apples
in the kiddie pool, and the drag queen mermaid? what a trip!)  Anyway, Doc
plays the most obscure house and manages to work them all together to build an
awesome groove through his whole set.  Wish I thought I could be awake to hear
him again at Groove Kitchen!

When Jan Cooley came on, a large portion of the bad vibe crowd had left, but
not enough of them.  Finally, around 5:00 it was almost totally the Love Garage
crowd and we finally got to have some fun.  DJ Riot came on next and that's
when we decided to take off.

In summary:  Avoid Love Factory before 5:00.  You have been warned.

Glad to hear y'all had so much fun at the Marina.

Share and enjoy.

Charter Oaks is now a "Hot" location, several raves have been held there
and any large amount of traffic attracts them.

 Other folks have also mentioned that the police said the FMR didn't have a 
permit - that legal issue aside, the noise complaint may have been generated
by a neighbor who got woken up by someone's car sound system. As I remember,
there are houses on the hill overlooking the Charter Oak warehouse. And,
some of the people who would go to an FMR probably have sound systems in 
their cars that can wake someone up at that distance, at that time of night.

 I know that, if such was the case, the cops should have cited the guys in
the cars instead of Charter Oak - but by the time the police arrive, 
conditions may have changed - so, bust the most likely suspect. Also, no
raving permit! [ They should open a new window at the police station for 
rave permits; how much to you think would be a fair charge?  :-) ]

 At the parking area for the Connection , the cops didn't show up until 
after a light went on in the house near the highway. Prior to the cops, 
people had parked their cars near the house, and some folks were listening
to music with their windows open. I and other "parking attendents" tried to 
tell them to turn the sounds down, with mixed success.

I'm really glad I didn't go.  I was down to my last $6.47 as of Friday
afternoon, and was looking forward to the FMR very much, as I thought
it would be outside due to the GREAT weather.  When I got the info
that it was going to be indoors and $5 donation, I was a bit
dissuaded, to say the least, but I still almost left a GREAT party (hi
Carl!) to drive (probably 1 1/2 hrs) to the FMR...  I'm glad I didn't,
sounds like I wouldn't have gotten in.

However, the post warehouse scene sounds like it was incredible, and
I'm really sorry I missed *that* and all of you...

sisters and brothers!
truely an amazing weekend. i can't add too much to what leah said except that
i felt at times the vibe of the whole  place as a membrane vibrating, a big
circle, 50 yards in diameter or so- pete, thanks for the 'telescope', i managed
to see the 'red giant'. the musics was really good and there were several times
when 10-20 people got into this 'group mind' and would dance in similar style
spountaneously. it lasted until 11:30 am sat., with an awsome 'one nation
under groove' towards the end. there was this guy drawing some pictures of
creatures 1/2human-1/2machine. did not get a positive feel from that, more
like totalitarian. did anybody else see these images ?
after a few hours sleep i went to TAZ at kommotion klub. there was a long
long line to get in, i am sure people got turned away. mykl , mike wertheim
rpcarpas and i got there about 7:30 so made it in. first, suzanne thomas
give a beautiful, moving invocation of 'chaos never died' - is this a
hakim bey thing ? then joseph  matheney did  'reading'/event thing in which
he tried with various levels of success to wake us up from the trance into
which tv has put us and to become participating actors instead of spectators.
he did various 'sing-along' things like something he called 'karaoke hootenany'
in which he started playing some tape music and he invited people to sing as
their favourite animal. first he asked people to come to the stage, but just a
few   people were courageous enuff to 'brave' the harsh lights. he then started
walking around and got more of a response. he was doing some amazing things
collapsing the conceptual iron maidens of our culture in very funny ways.
one other thing i ermember was that he offered to kiss anyone's ass since there
offer. i should mention that all the men wanted their ass kissed on the
flesh - they seemed willing to drop their pants - while the women kept their
pants/undrpants on. does this mean anything ?
after this, hakim bey read from his T A Z - temporary autonomous zones,
grouping like this network or the raves we go, where people are building the
new culture/society, or like the rainbow gathereing, and several others i
forget now. one thing it occured to me is that for these taz to develop,
there need be 'cracks' in the structure of the old culture and i think this
is the primary function that dada/surrealism/situationism/punk performed.
it is time now to 'move "beyond" punk', which we are doing - my  opinion,
of course - and use thses cracks to build the new (edge?). when there are
enuff of these taz's, we will spontenously 'flip' to this new culture, in
a manner different from the old 'revolutions' from above, which just
replaced the old hierarchies with new ones. it's like a phase transition
in water, going from water to ice, with the taz serving as nucleation points
for ice to form, water being the old structure, ice the new. it is non-local,
non-hierarchical, 'democratic'.
so anyway, after hb, nick herbert talked about how quantum physics has open
up new avenues of knowledge as well as new avenues of ignorance. these latter
spaces interest him, and he read us some very funny poems exploring his
ignorance about things like what men want.
finally, raw talked about some of his ideas like 'f for fake fake' an orson
wells fake documentary about an art forger, in which the structure of the
movie resembles the content to auch an extent that we soon start questioning
what is real and what is fake in the whole thing. he was also on this
keltic trip, talking about 'irish facts', half-truths and lies characteristic
of keltic culture, said raw. again, very funny and 'n liten ing' . i would
say that one of the features of this whole evening was the hi level of mirth
present. very unusual for 'serious' type of 'anarchist' event.
there were supposed to be more things, and they probably were, but i left
soon after raw finished talking, since the band afterwards seemed to ponderous
and heavy and boring.  and amazing evening.

Mais oui. Last time I stayed at Kingswood Villages, which are very nice,
but I would think that for a ravers trip a more isolated location would
be better. Away from people who might object to a lot of music and dancing.

Hi All:

In Regards to Snowboarding:

I have just started boarding and was a good skier and let me tell you that the
first day on the board you will be on your butt and knees most of the time.  It
is a hard sport and you have to WANT to DO it, NOT want to try it.  I love the
sport I will never ski again i.e. My dad said he pay my way for a ski trip with
him as long as I use my skis, I turned him down.

Subject: SFR SNOWBOARDING GETAWAY...


well folx, i've got a pretty good response to my idea of an SFRaves 
snowboarding trip, so i looked into it more and here's what i found:

at bear, which is only about 3.5 hours from s.jose (where i live, i'm
not sure from sf, but kan.t be much more), you can snowboard all day
for $55.

this inkludes:  2 hour lesson, board rental, boot rental, and lift 
tik.  i know 55 bonez may seem a bit stEEp, but considering how much
lift.tix cost nowadaze, it's quite a bargain.

i hear bear is quite nice right now too!

there's also sierra ski ranch, which is mellow (i know there will be
lots o' beginners (including mE) :) but not rEAlly much funn... 8(


if anyone has access to a kabin (i mite) please say so, as that could
save us all a lot o' money!  also bringing up your own food will save
a lot, az a burger up there kosts about $$5!!

i wuz thinking uv going up the weeknd of march 5th.  how does that work
with everyone elses squedulez?

also, i will probably go up a coupla timez in between now and then, if
anyone iz interested in carpooing (<- gross) carPOOLing up with me....


and niels, pretty much everywhere you can snowboard is also a ski area.
but b.ware, i hear once you try snowboarding, you'll never go back to 
two skis!  :)

there are lotza more options, and it's REEEEEEEALLY flexible, so let me
hear some input if you have any ideaz..

for those of you who are getting this for the first time:


WE ARE TRYING TO ORGANIZE A SNOWBOARDING / SKI (ehem!:) / SNOWFUN TRIP
FOR THE WEEKEND OF ~MAR. 5TH.   SFRAVERS ARE ALL WELCKOME TO JOIN US,

Subject: Musical Comdom for your ravin' pleasure

>From the San Jose Mercury News, 2/7/'93

SONG IN YOUR HEART ISN'T ENOUGH?  TRY THE MUSICAL CONDOM

by Susan Q. Stranahan

Paul Lyons is a proud guy, a guy who had a dream, pursued it and
trumphed.

And while half of him wants the world to know of his
accomplishment, the other half's not so sure.

See, Paul Lyons also is a shy guy.  And his triumph came in
November when he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 5,163,447.

For a musical condom.

Or, as the patent reads, a "force-sensitive, sound-playing
condom."

With the exception of his brother, his attorney and a few close
friends, Lyons, of Southbridge, Mass., hasn't told anyone of his
invention.

"Even if I made a million dollars off it, I probably wouldn't
want to go around telling everyone I've succeeded in this area,"
he said the other day.  "It's enough just for me to know it."

Keeping the lid on his succes may prove somewhat diffficult.  His
name and address were published with the patent certificate.

He's already gotten calls from regular readers of the Patent
Official Gazette, the federal register of patents issued.

"Most of them were lawyers who wanted to know where they could
buy the condoms, " said Lyons.

Attention: Productions has yet to begin.  Lyons is still looking
for a manufacturer.  So don't loook for the condoms until summer
of fall -- at the very soonest.

That hasn't deterred some other eager entrepreneurs.

Lyons recently got a call from a company that -- for a price --
would reproduce a copy of his patent certificate, complete with
detailied diagram of the condom, on a lampshade.

He declined.

There's a part of Paul Lyons -- who politely declines to provide
his occupation or even his age -- that chafes at this
self-imposed anonymity.  He sees himself fulfilling the American
dream -- 1990's version -- of using his wits to get ahead.

"What does a person have if he doesn't have millions of
dollars?" he asked the other day.  "He has his ability and his
intelligence."

MOTHER OF INVENTION

"My motto is 'Find a need and fill it.'  THat's what I did," he
said.

Frankly, Lyons marvels that somebody hadn't already invened a
musical condom.

"It seems so simple," he said.  "I was sure somebody had already
done it."  Like other great inspirations, it grew out of a casual
conversation.

"A friend and I were talking about the recession and different
ways of making money," Lyons explained.  "I thought about it for
a few days and made a list.  The invention has to be something
inexpensive, something the majority of people can afford and
that the majority of people would find appealing in some way."

There were other considerations.

"You need something with a good amount of planned obsolescence,m
something that';s not going to last 100 years or so, something
that will have a quick turnover."

In other words, something like a condom -- an item people will
buy, use, throw away, and buy some more.

The musical condom -- he's still working on a jcatchy name --
wasn't Lyons' first invention idea.  He actually wanted to patent
small containers to house cladiolus bulbs to make them easier to
plant in the spring and remove each fall after blooming.

THree or four people already had that idea, he discovered.

Nobody, however, had thought of assembling a "miniature
piezo-electric sound transducer, a microchip which controls the
operation of (the) transducer, a powersupplying dry-cell battery
and a switch."

When pressure is applied to the rim of the condom containing the
tiny circuitry, the transducer emits "a predetermined melody, or
a voice message," according to the patent.

FLEXIBLE TIMING

The patent continues: "The music or voice message may be played
once, or it may be repeated continuously for several minutes to
coincide with the duration of coitus.

"A voiced message may be a warning about safe sex, or a
compliment to the couple for using a condom.  Suitable melodies
-- if music is played -- may be `The 1812 Overture,' `Ode to
Joy,' ... or any popular love song."

Those are only suggestions, of course.  Lyons said the number of
condom tunes is mind-boggling.

"Once you start thinking, you can't stop," he said.

His attorney likes Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?"  Lyons
likes "Born To Be Wild."

It has taken Lyons several years to get this far in his quest to
produce the musical condom.  It hasn't been easy.

"What held me up for a long time was finding the musical
component," he said.  "You can't believe the phone bills I ran
up.  Finally, everyone said I had to go to the Orient to find it,
which I did not want to do.  I wanted to stay in America."

But one call to a Hong Kong trade association and Lyons had the
names of 10 Asian companies that could provide the tiny sound
unit, similar to the type used in audio greeting cards.

That wasn't the end, however.  Consider the matmter of volume.

"The speaker has to large enough and powerful enough to eb heard
over the, uh, background noise -- but not heard in the next
room," he said.

"And you have to look at liability.  The battery in it would be
so low in terms of producing current."

The, of course, there was the question of "prior art," as the
patent office refers to it.  That required extensive research to
prove that nobody else had laid claim to the musical condom.

The only apparent competition was an item in the 1990 Fredericks'
of Hollywood catalog called the "Wedding Surprise," which the
modest Lyons has difficulty describing in detail except to say
that it was a musical undergarment.

Patent examiners apparently checked the catalog and didn't regard
the item as a threat to Lyons' claim.

Lyons hopes his condom wwill sell for $3.50 to $5, and is
confident there is a market.

Subject: FOUR NEW SFRAVES EVENTS ON THE HORIZON


Hiya gang!  The cauldron of human restlessness has been brewing, and I've
been getting anxious to have a few more events too, so it looks like March
is going to be quite a full month for sfraves-related events - so here goes.

I)  The SFRaves Birthday Party / Connection 2

        A few of us believe/hope that we have found Perfect Site #2 (the
distinction of Perfect Site #1 goes to Bonny Doon, and I guess #1.5 can go
to the Berkeley Marina).  This is a site that is very much like a miniature
version of Bonny Doon - it can hold at most around 300 people total, has 
plenty of legal parking, and also involves quite a hike from the parking
lot to the site.  It's also in a slightly more patrolled area than Santa
Cruz; the good news, though, it that it's quite close to the city and even
accessible by public transit.  We don't forsee it as being as large-scale
as Connection 1, simply because of the size concern, but it definitely will
be a happening party.  Our "wish list" of DJ's includes Spun, a Hardkiss or
two, and Jon Williams, and a few sfraver DJ's.  We pretty much have a sound
system laid out (if you have a Peavey CS800 amp we could borrow that would
be great!) and a few lighting effects.  The reason I'm posting this to the
list is we're going to need quite a few people to help set up the site and
who are willing to be there when it shuts down in the morning.  If we could
repeat that sea of bottled water that showed up at Connection that would be
superb too.  Anyways, if you're interested in helping send me a message - 
most of the planning work will be done on sfraves-planners, a parallel 
mailing list of sfraves regulars who are willing to cope with the increased
traffic :)  For now, the site will be kept secret, simply because it's in
a higher-risk zone.  We will be using a map point that night to further
help.

DATE: the target date is Saturday, March 6th - this is ideal because it's
right before a full moon, so there would be ample natural light to help
people get to the spot.  However, if there's interest, I wouldn't mind
moving this to the 13th, the next night.  If you have a preference, send
me mail explaining why.... oh, the FMR is Sunday night the 7th (supposedly)
My reason for choosing that weekend is it's the closest to the actual
birthday of sfraves, which was the beginning of March last year.

HELP NEEDED:  Basically, at this point, we need people to haul equipment,
people to bring water and other goodies, and maybe a few visual effects too.
Because it's so close we don't have to worry about a lot of things that
caused trouble at Connection, like the buses, etc... anyways, send me
mail!


II) The SFRAVES ski/snowboarding trip: 

	Mark Baldwin and Scott Stewart, I guess, are the ones organizing
this.  They initially asked if the weekend of March was cool - so if they
could move it a week later that would be great, if not we could move the
party a week later too.  Again, date suggestions should be sent via e-mail
to Mark and Scott and cc'd to me if it's relevant to Connection 2.  I'd
love to go skiing again :)


III) and IV) - Orb or Bust!

	As many of you know, the Orb is coming to the west coast; they
haven't announced an SF date yet, but they are playing March 19th in Los
Angeles at the Santa Monica Hall of Aviation, and March 24th (hopefully
hopefully hopefully) in Salt Lake City.  And, I presume they'll play
inbetween those dates in SF.  I'm definitely making the trip down to 
Los Angeles to see them; I'll have room for about 3 others in my car,
and also will be staying at my parent's place which would have room for
many more if lots of people want to go down.  We can also meet up with 
the socal-raves crew and have a celebration somewhere.

	As for Salt Lake City, Bryan Campbell said he'd be willing to
drive his RV out there (as long as others pay for gas, etc.), which sleeps
six.  It's a 15 hour drive each way, but when you think about it it's only
10 DJ tapes.  :)  Anyways, we may also be able to bring a sound system
and generator, which would preclude stopping on the way or on the way back
at Area 51 or some other remote UFO-related location and holding a
nano-rave (cool name, Joachim!) or something.  Of course, the more the
merrier... and I'm sure Pete would love to have us there to support him.

	So if you're interested in these two trips, let me know... the idea
of caravaning to go see the Orb is just too cool for me to handle by myself :)
My ultimate goal, of course, is to meet the good Doctor and show him that
computers AREN'T just for shut-in's, maybe hook him up to vrave or something..

any chance of being online at this one?  we are holding our own event 
down here on the 6th and it looks like a strong possibility of us being 
online for it..

we can try and get one of the ne-raves online too..

from her friend that it was going to be in Bonny Doon, and wanted
to wait until we were sure...of course, I assured her I talked
to bri, who had to know, but that wasn't enuf for some reason...urgh..
so I invited some people over at 1am and let my tapes do the talking..


woefully in adequate,but fun.

Anyway, i will be at Deep Space and I hope to see some of you out there..

An announcement:

I will be in a play at Santa Clara University starting this Friday until
the next Saturday (12-20?) and wanted to invite anyone to come down...hopefully
after one of the shows we can all go out, if there is somewhere to go (Love
American Style?)...

	February 12-20 (this friday until next saturday)
	Tix are like $5-8 I think, depending on student prices, etc.
	The box office is 408-554-4015
	Shows start at 8, except for Sunday which begins at 7..

If you are in the area and don't have anything else to do, check it out.  It's a cool play, and it would be fun to see you after the show and then go and hang
out dance or whatever..

Just thought I'd plug work....Bri and Leah were able to see my recital, and
that went well, and this should be really a fun time

Anyway, I gotta sleep..first dress tonight...take care of yourselves, and 
havea good week..

No, they just blatantly disregard it and make laws as minor as local

1st Hakim Bey...very interesting post-situationist revision of the future.
stimulating
2nd Nick Herbert...the epitome of what nerd-ravers will evolve into in old
age...especially if their career is the quantum mechanics of time travel.
3rd RAWilson...pass.  missed the new jokes about irish wisdom, would have
liked to stay but needed my engerny 4 later...komotion was hot, crowded,
no sense just standing around.  naptime

Groove Kitchen...what a lineup.  Missed Buck, heard it went well.  arrived
just as Garth came up. nice sweat brewin.  Jeno played one of the finest
sets i've heard in the 2 years i been doin this turkey trot.  extended gruv.
great set-up 4 doc martin, who after a nod to Marley's b-day, kicked butt.
chilled watchin the models entwine their stockings while the universe opened
up around them.  then on to DNA, where i realized it's been too long since i
heard thomas.  as high an NRG set as i've heard recently.  

i didn't need my nurse, the wheelchair, or my iv...just danced the fool.
(i wore world's second most foolish hat.)

Okay, several people wrote me suggesting good reasons for moving it to
the 13th, so we'll have it then.  Which means the first weekend in March
is open for the ski trip.

One especially good reason - if the FMR is the next night, it may be too
tempting for them to want to throw it there :)

Well, if yer gonna ask MOBY if he remembers me, ask him if he keeps in contact
with any of the old Cafe crew, we've all followed him and supported his
work (and love it!).  Honestly, he prob'ly won't remember me, mainly because
he never new me too well (yet another highschool groupie who worshipped him as
the DJ God he was destined to be), but he was always cool to everybody, and
would play the trademark Sesame Street/Muppet/Chicago meddly when the 
evening's dance drew to a close.  Ah, the simple days of youth, when we'd
hold hands and pogo to our favourite Boston song "More than a feeling" 
and revel in the joy of being the collected outcasts of our respective\highschols, gathered together with our black Depeche Mode t-shirts, Docs, silver
ankhs on silken cords, and teen angst.  
	Well, thanks for letting me relive those days gone by of early
industrial techno revelations.

Subject: Shoes For Raving?



Hello to All!

 I'd like to find out what people's favorite footgear is for marathon
dancing. The mystery-brand pair of shoes I own don't take care of my feet
for the 4 to 5 hours I usually spend at a rave.

 If you can give me some details with your recommendation, I'd also
appreciate it. ( I'll compile the replies I get, and re-post the results ):

 Best Shoes For:

1. Indoor/Hard Floor Dancing

2. Outdoor/Uneven Dance Floor Dancing


 And, since my shoe size is 9 1/2 (inches):

3. Shoe Comes in Half-Sizes? (Someone told me Doc Martins only come in 
   half-sizes, so I haven't bothered looking at them).



					Thanks!

Subject: Ariel Fund Raiser


  Dear fellow dancers,

  I talked to Brian and he suggested that I post this to the raves
list, rather than the calendar.  I only read the sfraves-calendar 
regularly, but you can get ahold of me via e-mail.

  The Ariel Dance Studio will be taking over Alberto's night club in
Mountain View on Sunday, Feb. 14 for a fund raiser.  So why, you might
well ask, is this of any interest to the Rave dance community?  Ariel
is one of the few places in Silicon Valley that teaches hip-hop dance
and gives young choreographers (who are not necessarily from the
"formal" dance community) a chance to choreograph for stage
performance.  Ariel is unusual in that they support a range of
creative diversity in dance.

  We have a dance concert scheduled for March 26 & 27 at the Palo Alto
high school auditorium which will include three hip-hop pieces, a
street dance piece, a very hot salsa duet and several Jazz and modern
dance pieces.  Theaters are now requiring $1 Million insurance
coverage and the studio only carries $500K.  They are also asking more
"up-front" money.  Dance is not an area where people make a lot of
money and the woman who runs the studio, Oanh Dang, makes just enought
to live on.  So we are having the fund raiser to pay for insurance and
create a fund to pay for theater deposits (the performances usually
cover themselves, so the fund will "replenish" itself).

  Here are the details:

  When:  Feb. 14, 7:00 to Midnight
  Where: Albertos Night Club, 736 W Dana, Mt. View
  Who:   Alberto's serves alcohol, so this event is 21 or over.
         Sorry.
  How Much: Tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door.

  There will be a beginning Hip-hop workshop from 7-8 PM, so this is
  a great opportunity for ravers to get some new moves.

  There will be a brief fashion show and a door prize drawing at 8:00
  This will be followed by dancing until Alberto's closes.  Many
  people from the Ariel Dance Company will be there so it will be a
  great opportunity to not only dance with a bunch of high energy
  dancers, but to pick up some new hip-hop and street dance moves.

  For information you can call:

         Ariel School of Dance
         3068 Scott Blvd.
	 Santa Clara, CA 95054
         (408) 247-3657

well, it seems as though the weekend of mar 5 is going to

the weekend of mar 12???  

geeez, brian... (:)

find out how much money we
(oops) will have to dish out.  quick responses are apprecitated,
but replying right away is /probably/ not totally necessary.  i
may be able to get a discount through freddy at sessions though, 
and it will probably help to know how much...

                Hi, my names noah I hardly ever post, and I'm not sure 
		we have ever met. So on that note I was wondering if
		this is going to be a one day event or all weekend?
		And If Bear is where your going I looked into it and
		it's only $25 dolla for those who own equipment already

when i first started raving, i went out and bought a pair of fila
basketball shoes - ultra padded.  they are bouncy and very comfortable.

i got a pair of doc marten's (don't think that story about them not
being available in half sizes is true) more recently and although they
took forever to break in, they are quite comfortable now and i don't
have any problems raving in them.  they aren't quite as bouncy as
the filas, but they are much more stylish...

Subject: terminology.....

Can anyone out there give coherent definitions for "techno" music and
"house" music?  and what precise qualities distinguish the two?  I have
also noticed that some people break the catagory of "techno" down into
still smaller catagories (i.e. acid techno), what distinguishes one "techno"
style from another?  or are they just different ways of saying the same thing?

I have a very good idea of what "house" and "techno" mean to me, but I
see that some other people have quite different perceptions of the terms.

My definations are:

"house" - moderately fast music, heavily influenced by various
black sub-cultures such as rap, blues, and jazz.  It typically cantains
vocals, a heavy beat, and little to moderate use of synthesizers (for
wierd sounds or effects).


"techno" - typically faster than "house (120+ bpm), very heavily synthesized,
with more reliance on the use of wierd sounds and effects than heavy base
lines (as typically found in "house").  Generally contains no vocals or
very short repeated phrases.  Also has a heavy beat.


These are over simplified, very rough definitions at best, but would most
people agree with most of what they contain?  Using these definitions, many
groups are difficult to classify.  For instance T99 and the Prodigy largely 
use the above definition of techno but add rap or vocals on top of it.

                     Anyway, just curious,

                              Jon.

I thought I'd throw in my two cents on this.  I was going to buy some Docs,
but my neighbors convinced me that Redwings are better.  They come in all
sizes, and *widths*, and the store owners are usually more interested in
getting you a good fit rather than making a buck (ie: they're not next to the
Fresh Jive).  I bought a pair of steel toe boots that I've been really happy
with.  I used to dance in a lower pair of softer leather boots, but these
boogie just as well if I tie the laces around the ankles.  I don't know if
Docs have steel toes, but these are seriously nice for moving things around,
kicking ice off your car (big problem in SF, I know), and although I haven't
jumped into a pit with them yet, I'd imagine my toes won't suffer the same
fate that they have in the past.

I wear a pair of black Nike Air cross-trainers more often
than not.  You get better lateral stability out of these
things than you would out of some running shoes, but they've
got the padding that is crucial for saving your joints, in
particular your knees. 

It's harder to do spins and slides in them unfortunately,
but I don't recommend wearing leather soled shoes.  There's
a good friend of mine who always wears leather shoes who is
now having some serious knee problems now that he's in his
late thirties.  

The one exception to the above: if I expect to be dancing in
an obnoxious crowd, I sometimes wear steel-toed Red Wings.
Great for slam dancing.  

If anyone knows a good brand of shock-absorbing, leather
soled shoes, I'd try those out.

Basically, I recommend "graduate student and/or geek shoes", e.g.
Rockport Pro-Walkers or Clarks Air-Walkers. They're pretty expensive,
but they're worth it. I especially recommend Brown Rockports :-). 

The above assumes that you're not a fashion-conscious raver (like me).
I care more about comfort than looks. I'd rather be able to dance for 6
hours straight than have fashionable-looking feet. (Which are just
going to get scuffed up dusty/grungy anyways). Besides, any fashionable
raver knows that wide shoelaces are where it's really at...

My current rave faves are my ol' Clarks' Air Walkers ($100) which I
bought in the UK a few years ago. They're great, offering just the
right amount of cush, and they slide just enough w/o being
out-of-control slippery when wet. Rockports, on the other hand, turn
into ice-skates when the floor gets wet.

And doc martens? Fuck 'em. I (sheepishly) admit to having a pair for
certain situations -- pretentious whine-and-cheeze art openings, trendo
industrial music events, clubs that don't let you in cuz your shoes are
too scruffy, hang-yerself-upside-down-by-yer-scrotum-n-cover-with-whip-
cream-while-making-animal-noises performance-art schticks -- But they
suck for dancing. THey may look oh-so trendy, but they're not really as
comfortable as a good nerdy walking shoe for the long-haul. 

For Outdoor raves? Cordura-fabric lightweight hiking boots.

Just my $0.02.

11  3   04:04 Fall Out

Comments:  Maybe the first Intermix disc was too perfect, thus making it
difficult to improve on perfection.  With this release, Bill and Rhys start
out sharp, decline, then come back up again.  "Funky Hell" and "Phaze One" are
very boring with nothing memorable about them, but on the tail ends with the
excellent "Down and Out" and the dark funk of "Fall Out" this disc is saved.
"Get Religion" harks back to the first Intermix disc with chorals, and bright
angelic synth riffs.  However, these riffs which were so innovative on their
first release are almost overused here.

Summary: 7/10.  Still great driving music.  I just wish we could get some

3   2   06:58 The Age of Love (Sign of the Time Mix)
4   4   06:53 The Age of Love (OPM Mix)

Comments:  Although I like the underlying music of this piece, I feel that
it is ruined by a pair of soundbite samples.  The "Come on, dance wid me"
sample is particularly annoying.  Other than that, Jam & Spoon do some capable
remixing of a track that originally wasn't very exciting.  My favorite remix
is probably "Sign of the Time" due to the fact that it doesn't have the
soundbites.

Summary: 6/10.  Good but not great.  I enjoy Jam & Spoon's own work more.

6   4   07:13 Grid Master Remix
7   3   04:04 Beirut Hilton Mix
8       04:54 I Fall Up

Comments:  Weirdly funky with heavy remixes by The Grid, "Ali Click" is
definitely in a different musical area than the last single, "Fractal Zoom".
This almost bends into jazz with loads of saxophone and the grooviest bass
flute I've heard in a long time.  The "Darkly Mad Mix" throws things into a
bit harder vein, yet keeps the original flavor around.  My favorite mix is the
"Beirut Hilton" which is so swanky it makes me want to shop for polyester
suits just so I can dance to this mix proper.  "I Fall Up" is an out-of-place
Byrnesque piece.  It would have been good if I had been expecting it, but it
certainly didn't fit in here.

Summary: 7/10.  Yet another single that Eno fans will like, but everyone else
should tread carefully.  If you like The Grid you'll enjoy this as well.

14      10:56 The Hyperspace Megamix

Comments:  A bit deeper, less progressive house oriented compilation than Rumor
Record's "Trance" series.  Many of the tracks on here do not have a very
strong beat, but they still have it, so they couldn't necessarily be
considered just for ambient listening.  However, I found the majority of the
tracks good to listen to, but most failed to move my body.  Cosmic Baby is on
the downside of things with two tracks that use the same samples and sound
very much alike.  On the upside, Nighttripper and Paradise 3001 turn in some
very moving stuff.  Then of course, there is Format, who was also on "Logic
Trance" with the excellent "Solid Session".  Format's "Damn Right" is almost
as good.

Summary: 7/10.  A good collection of trance.  The only problem is that tracks
tend to be very samey and undistinguished.

4   4   03:29 Migraine Mix
5   4   03:37 Radio Edit

Comments:  Not very unusual house techno remixed in a standard manner.  "Think
Tank" and "Migraine" attempt to be hardcore, but just come off limp.  The
"Original" and "Radio" mixes are better, but not outstanding.  Where this
single really shines is with the "Spanish Trance Mix".  Samples are cut to a
minimum, emphasizing the sparkling treble line, then it is all overlaid with
a beautifully done accoustic guitar.  Not particularly dancey, but it sounds
great!

Summary: 7/10.  The "Spanish Trance Mix" alone is worth the purchase price.

5   4   06:04 Machine Mix
6   3   05:19 Alternate Album Version

Comments: "Move - On" is my favorite track on the "BFORD 9" album.  The
"Mindless" and "Furious" remixes turn this into a seriously danceable piece of
music.  A nice pumping melody and OK vocals add instead of detract from this.
Very rarely do you get a single that succesfully remixes from hardcore to
trance, but Baby Ford and Mindless have done it here.

Summary: 8/10.  Crummy digi-pak packaging, but fine music is contained within.


Moby: Next is the E

5   4   04:26 Thousand
6   5   03:34 Next is the E (Cool World Mix)

Comments: "Next is the E" is done up in standard kick-your-head Moby fashion.
The original version on the album is almost identical to the "Cool World" mix,
and although it is a good dance tune, it lacks the moveability of "Drop a
Beat" or "Go".  However, once the piano melody has been added, such as in the
"Edit" and "I Feel It" things start to groove a bit better.  The best mix of
all is the "Synthe Mix" which is funky and deep.  The high bpm of "Thousand"
is funny the first time you hear it, but after a while you realize that this
is the emptiest Moby track ever.  Good joke, bad music.

Summary: 7/10.  Nice remixes, good original track, but somehow it feels like
there are only three versions and a joke on here.

Comments: Once again, Dougans and Cobain distinguish themselves from the rest
of the crowd by producing dance music that is quite unique.  There are few
boring tracks on this compilation, "Theme From Hot Burst" comes closest in a
"go nowhere" sense.  "So This is Love" uses what sounds like a Judy Garland
sample over a melodic, smooth theme.  The other Mental Cube titles shine as
well.  "Q" being more of in the Future Sound of London album style, and
"Chile" being a bass explosion to the head.  The majority of the tracks are
progressive house, but there are a couple of decent hardcore and trance as
well.

Summary: 8/10.  My portable skips all over this CD.  I noticed that there
weren't any scratches on it, but it had suction-cup marks from manufacturing
on the play-side!  I haven't managed to polish them off yet, but you may want
to check the CD before you buy it.  Other than that complaint, Earthbeat is
high quality music.

Subject: The devolution of rave culture


This was originally posted to alt.rave.  I had decided not to impose
this bum trip on my friends on the sfraves list, but Brian urged me
to do so, so blame him for this downer.  ;-)
.....................................................................

Some reasons for the dilution and demise of "rave culture".

The Obvious ones:

- Promoters who focus on the money making aspects of rave events without 
attempting to promote the caring/communal/spiritual/transcendental aspect
of raving.

- Influx of newcomers who go to raves as the new cool fad thing to do without
realizing that there is more to raving than just dancing to house music.

- Media coverage that completely misrepresents the cultural aspects of raving
and therefore confusing and closing the minds of potential ravers who are not
being left to discover raving for themselves.

- DJs and musicians who cater to the mainstream masses by resorting to 
disco music and "bubblegum techno".  This, of course is merely a subset 
of the fact that little cottage industries, like DJing have sprung up and 
now seek to perpetuate themselves instead of just being part of a Now 
happenning.

The Less Obvious ones:

- Long time ravers who now stick with their clique of raver friends and no
longer feel like reaching out and sharing their vibe with newcomers.

- Reduced usage of MDMA among ravers due to expense, availability, and the
fact that it just isn't as new and exciting anymore.

- Growing obsession over trivial ego-focused aspects of raving.  Things like 
which groups are really Moby, and all of the standard dry record reviews, 
while informative and useful, shift our focus away from the experiential 
of-the-moment feelings to the analytical selfabsorbed knowledge-based 
smugness that characterizes the basic thrust of most of alt.rave posts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would be interested in anything anyone has to add about the cultural aspects
of raving, its evolution, definitions and significance, and whether any of the
aspects that make it unique will be perpetuated; either by a continuing rave
"underground" or by some new direction that would keep it a step ahead (or 
just apart) from the common denominizational forces of the cultural 
mainstream.

BRAVO!!!  Thank you, Lee, for summarizing to a T exactly what is wrong with
a lot of the scene today.  And yet, I remain hopeful.  Why?  Because if we
are able to IDENTIFY what's wrong with the scene, and still maintain some sort
of HOPE for recovery, we can make attempts to FIX what's wrong.  

The important thing now is NOT to think that this is something we can't
control, that, "well, okay, raves are dead. howbout horror movies?" 

Every one of those things you mentioned, Lee, is something that's 
reversible.  If we even are able to affect a third of these points I'll
think we've done a good job....

Support those promoters who don't do this.  Find those who don't aim to get
20000 hawdkoah members, they are happy if they get 200 and break even.  And
if such promoters don't exist in your area, DIY.  If you go into it thinking,
okay, I don't care if I don't make a gazillion dollars, I just want to break
even, make sure everyone who works (DJ's, sound guys, etc) are paid what
they're worth and are happy too, then you are almost guaranteed to make it
a good party.

Ed-U-cate the narramines!  Show them the House Music and Planetary Healing
Flyer.  Give them an orange.  If they don't get it, don't invite them to
your next party.

This is perhaps the hardest of all to counter.  The question may be, do we
need to counter it?  Can't we just have our parties, where everyone there
"gets it", and who cares if Liza Gibbons or John Tesh appreciate what we're
about?  Like Mark Ameba says, we can't possibly hope to overwhelm the current
media's modus operandi; but what's gonna happen is an information revolution
from below, in essence an _underwhelming_, feuled by the communications
revolution and the mass anarchization of information technology.  It won't
matter after very long what the media's official stance on something is, 
because alternate sources of information are rapidly becoming more and more
available.

But there IS a danger if our activities, which we know in our heart to be
something GOOD and WORTHWHILE, are percieved by the majority to be HARMFUL.
This is a situation the women's rights movement crossed over the past
generation, a situation the gay rights movement is currently crossing, and
a situation the drug legalization movement is about to start crossing though.
Raves currently don't affect as many people as deeply as these three do, but
it does have a similar course though which it must wind.  In all these cases,
the general opinion of an entire population had to/has to change.  And this
change was brought about by education, by information, by expressing 
confidence in your actions.

Follow the same example as what you did for the promoters; identify what
music you DO like, and hunt it down.  And if it doesn't exist, MAKE it.
In fact, make an attempt at producing your own music.  Start picking out
records you like and start spinning.  Garth, one of the premiere DJ's in
San Francisco, has been spinning for less than a year and a half.  

>The Less Obvious ones:

>- Long time ravers who now stick with their clique of raver friends and no

This is definitely a real problem.  And perhaps the second-hardest one to
fix.  I have met the best friends I've ever had and will ever have through
"raving" - and often I fall into the trap of always wanting to be only 
around them, and not communicate to others.  This is something each person
will have to work on themselves.  There is also the tendency to treat
friendships at raves as "unique", as if they wouldn't have happened if it
weren't for the rave, and thus don't mean anything after the music's 
stopped.  This too is bad.  

So how do we fix this?  Lose yourself from your close friends at your
next rave.  Take along a sack of oranges or lollipops and hand them out to 
people.  Take a Polaroid camera and take pictures of people and hand it
to them.  Practice random acts of kindness and senseless generosity (I
didn't make that up :).  If you and others practice this, you can turn a
rave around in short order.  If you see someone sitting in a corner with 
their head in their knees, sit next to them and ask if anything's alright.
If you see a dancer who looks like he's been going for hours, whose eyes
are bugged out and skin pale and sweating profusely, ask them if they'd 
like water and perhaps like to sit down for awhile....

>- Reduced usage of MDMA among ravers due to expense, availability, and the
>fact that it just isn't as new and exciting anymore.

This is a symptom of the general lack of knowlege about MDMA and drugs in
general among people in the rave scene.  MDMA does tend to lose its
effectiveness after a few months of regular use.  But people often fail
to connect what they learn while using that or other drugs to their common,
everyday lives.  Many people cannot fathom going to raves undosed on 
something, if only to help them stay up all night (more daytime raves!!!).
This is the real enemy.  I have no problem with people dosing at raves;
in fact I think raves may be, with a few precautions, the best places in
the world for psychedelic exploration.  But if people so connect the two
that one just doesn't make it without the other, than they miss the point
of both. 

>- Growing obsession over trivial ego-focused aspects of raving.  Things like

It's only natural to want to analyse what makes me happy, so that I can
find it again and make myself happy again.  Raving makes me really, truely
happy; it fills a void in me that few other things can.  I've done a LOT
of thinking about it over the past year, a lot of philosophizing, a lot of
observing, a lot of raving :)  If this makes me come across as smug I
apologize; and I would have to agree that the creeping ego-centricism 
poses one of the greatest threats of all.  Sure, Garth and Jeno are GODS,
but we worship them at the expense of other, perhaps equally brilliant DJ's
in the bay area who also have something to contribute.  This applies to
the music too - we're all trippin over ourselves trying to find out all
of Moby's names and pretending to be Aphex Twin, when only a few are brave
enough to try and search out those rare tracks which can come out of the 
blue, grab you by the aorta and thrust you into the heavens.  We need
to be aware of the fact that House music has accomplished something that
hasn't been seen since London/NewYork circa 1976 - a real DIY feeling.
I have begun to realize that if I had saved up all the money I had spent 
on CD's and records over the past 5 years and spent it instead on musical
equipment and time, I could probably have MADE most of the music I've bought!

I used to go to concerts all the time a few years ago; now I go to concerts
maybe once every 4 months.  Why?  Because at concerts, all your attention
is focused on a stage usually far away and on one person's or group's personal
emotions.  At raves, the attention is on the WHOLE, and you are a part of
that whole.  It's throwing a stone at the 80's repression of individualism,
a declaration of self-righteousness that is neither boastful nor wrong.  It's
saying WE ARE THE DREAMERS OF THE DREAM; GIVE ME ROOM TO PURSUE IT.

Subject: invitation to join Analogue Heaven mailing list!

Greetings!

This is to invite you to join my mailing list, Analogue Heaven. It is primarily
an analogue synth user's group dedicated to:

* Providing a means of discussion about analogue synths, convertors, and
  modifications of analogue synths

* Providing a common domain to those who enjoy using analogue equipment (you
  can use digital equipment too, if you like... I do...)

* Offering tips and suggestions about used synth prices, buyer's market,
  modification to analogue synths, MIDI to CV/gate/sync convertors, etc...

The volume is medium. I usually send about 4 to 6 posts a day, sometimes a 
little less, sometimes a little more. Current threads now are MIDI to Sync 
conversion (data transfer rates, etc), Analogue breath controllers, building 
your own synths, etc..

I welcome all requests to be included on the list to this account.. for now, I 
run this out of my regular account, (this one) but soon we will have real 
address, if all goes through well.

The current amount of users on the list is at 80 or so. I feel that everyone 
has lots of purposes with their analogue equipment, and I am anxious to see 
what people have to say. There might be an analogue FAQ in the works, and I am 
ready to help as much as possible.

For those who are just getting started in keyboards, music making, or analogue 
equipment, it may seem at times a little too technical, but I urge you to try 
it out, you might be able to connect with someone who can answer your question 
or help you out with your problem.


So.....see you the sea of square and sine waves!!!

Well, I'm sure Jon et,al. will say that Doc Martins are the way to go
but if you don't need to be a fashion victim, there are other alternatives.

	For club, warm cozy raves, I wear nike hightop "aerobics"
	shoes, these are not really "aerobics" shoes any more and have
	been modified for general purpose "urban chump" wear.
	They are light and I've had my pair for almost 2 years,
	I need a new pair now cuz a cat pissed on one of them.
	But they held up well and I'm hard on shoes, they're all
	black so they are versatile.

	For "Hardcore" environments, like the FMR, and dirty wet warehouses
	like the gathering on NY eve, I have a pair of Hi-Tek Magnums,
	They are lighter than docs, (but less "stylish" unlike you like
	the military look), just as rugged but are not all leather, they
	get more and more comfortable as the days go by.  They provide
	GREAT ankle support and good protection from the elements,
	people stepping on your feet, etc.  They are also a more stable
	platform on uneven surfaces than the nikes, they cost about $80
	at Vally Fair mall ( in San Jose, behind the Silicon Curtain :)

With this upcoming event, I'm going more to the surface than I ever have
before.  Full color flyers, posters, tickets in record stores, the whole
shebang (minus advertising on the bastard "alternative" radio station, I won't
stoop that low).  I'm afraid a lot of people are going to say, "Geesh, Taste
sold out, how sad."  When in fact I'm extremely scared about just breaking
even.  We tried staying with the underground with Communion and got burned
bad.  I'm also afraid that the "vibe" at Orb may not be up to par.  Of course
when you consider what lengths -other- promoters are going to in other cities,
Salt Lake may have the most underground date of them all.

By the way, San Francisco is the 20th.  They're going to the coast to play LA
and SF, driving out to Salt Lake, then returning to the coast to play Portland
and Seattle.  Salt Lake is the only date in the western states, they're not
even playing Phoenix or Denver.  Although I haven't recieved confirmation, a
person this morning told me that I've practically got it secured.

P.S. It's snowing again.

Yeah, I guess my original statement assumed that it's easy to tell if the
promoter is a genuine honest one and one who wants to rake in the dough. In
practice it may not be, and your case may be an example.  What I would do
is call all or a lot of people on your mailing list and tell them about the
event, that you're trying to keep the vibe of the underground while still being
able to break even; I think you have a very loyal following in SLC and if
you keep the lines of communication open to them I would hope that they would
listen...

Afterlife at DNA is 6AM - 12:30.  But I'm kind of excited about the
Hardkiss thing starting this Sat. morning at 4am.  Does anyone know
how long it's supposed to go to?  I plan to get there at around 6.
Oh, the GG Park thing should be starting up soon, too.

Brian makes some excellent, positive points on all this.  I only have
a little more selfrighteous whining left to add.

My concern is that there may not be enough of us.  The influx of new
would-be ravers is pretty intense.  And generally, these people 
seem happy to spend $20 to hear disco on a shitty sound system.  And
anyway, who am I to say that their method of having a good time isn't 
good enough? 

> Follow the same example as what you did for the promoters; identify what

And these premier DJs are the ones that are playing so much uninspiring (to
me) music, and by doing so establish a trend that other DJs follow.  The 
masses who follow these DJs (because 'true' ravers know who the best DJs are)
eat it up.  At ComeUnity, Jeno blew me away for about an hour, and then
shifts into some crap like the Pointer Sisters (I think) "We Are Family".
But everyone is happy and feeling good, so they go with it.  Maybe I'm
just too picky.  We'll see what happens at Wicked on the 20th because
I know those DJs can be amazing, but something tells me that I'm gonna 
finish the nite at that TAZ wherehouse rave.

Personally, I think people should be forced to have a psychedelic experience
as part of raving, then maybe they would realize why disco is so lame.
Just kidding, of course. ;-)

Yes, Redwings are the move my friends! These are perhaps the most comfortable
boots that I have ever worn, and they fit soooo well... mmmmmmmm... boots...
The store is a definite trip as well! The storekeepers' approach is always
friendly and accomodating... They act as if they have you for
years and just run this smooth ass transaction, but it is cool because there
isn't really any bullshit involved and you KNOW that you're going get a
square deal on some funky boots. They even run this "10 percent discount for
you" line EVERY TIME which of course makes me laugh and they just give me a 
deadpan stare and continue unphased. But I digress... Ok, boots.. oh
steeltoe so you can kick in telLIEvision screens, and FREE waterproofing.
If they are oiled leather, you can bring them in anytime and get them re-
oiled. Free. Quite a pitch, huh?

And my other raving shoes are "Romeo King" bedroom slippers. These are 
the type of slippers that fools used to lounge in with their silk smoking
jackets and all of that 30's jive. The soles are leather, and slide around
quite nicely, but are probably bad for the ankles..

Kuba has some yellow and black steeltoe rubber boots that he is quite fond
of, and which I must say look stunning on him..

Juana wears engineer boots cuz she's a tuff one, eh? ...and looks soo good with
them on!

E wears these black courderoy slip on that he stole from thrifty (the scrub!)
I must say that they look smooth as hell.

Docs:

Are they *seriously* at Kmart?

If so, is everyone going to jump on the in.trend bandwagon and say
this is a BAD thing?  I personally don't like Kmart much, but, hell,
if I can get Docs there for cheaper than the regular fashion stores,
than, hell, that's a +.......

ObSceneRant:

=)

Also, this is just a topic I've been thinking of for a long time
laely, but I think that those people who *seriously* believe, who are
angry about certain aspects of culture spreading to a larger group
are, at heart, subconsciously selfish to a fault.  Culture is all
about common aspects, consensus realities, and you can't put
start/stop points [ie, 12 year olds wearing docs is bad, aquanet
people at rAves is bad, etc.] on that, because it's all relative -
everything is relative, so these things you choose to focus on are
just reference points tha Ultimately Don't Matter.  

If you *don't* like it, then do something about i besides whine and
show selfishness.  first of all, realize that culture inevitablly
grows, changes, morphs, expands, etc.  It never retracts.  The only
time it even *seems* to retract is when a new culture is developed out
of the overlap between a couple other cultures or something. So, you
can't live in the past, why even try to because it only causes
frustration when you get back to realizing what's really going on in
the here-and-now.  

Just acknowledge and accept where rave culture is now, and what the
trajectory *seems* to be to you, subjectively.  If you don' like that
trajectory than get togther and do things to change it, which is
something I just saw in a post Brian made.  Acceptance and
acknowledgement is te frist step, the second is ideas to change, the
third is action to change.

More re: shoes

I saw a cool-looking pair of *platform* Pumas in a town up here called
Boulder, on the CU Campus [not at a rave].....And this is a state
where people don't even where platforms to raves or afterhours yet en
masse as compared to what i think might be going on in CA.....Let
alone wearing platform *pumas* [not docs], let alone wearing them out
and out in public...it was cool....

anyway, just poking my head in the sidedoor....stay peaceful and dance
strong... 

OH!  One more thing:

how the hell can you people be talking about snowboarding and not even
mention Colorado!?!?!  We are the Shred Capital, My Friends....bowls

  OFFICE MEMO          RE>The devolution of rave culture      Date:2/10/93
Greetings,

          As a new member of this virtual community I was hesitant to post my
point of view, but I had to jump in on this one.

          I have been raving for almost two years in SF and in San Jose were
I'm from.  Not to live in the past, but when I first started going out the
whole crowd seemed to be more like one big happy family going for it driven by
mezmorizing sonic impulses to clear away the misunderstanding   within
themselves and between their neighbors.  It was always a safe haven to totally
lose yourself and then find that more pure you that todays society sometime
constricts and suppresses.  
          Now, with all the hype and popularity, it seems to me the scene has
almost gone by the way side.  Except for a few parties and DJs I support I
don't feel comfortable going out to newer places because of bad experiences
with people that (I think) do not get it.  It seemed to me that I was the one
that was doing it "wrong" and reavaluated my thinking.  
          Thanks to Brian and Lee for showing me that there are other
individuals out there who seem to have the same goal I do.  I think one way to
help the scene for the better is through education.  Pamphlets like The
Imaginal Rave and others like it should be manditory reading for first time
ravers who are not lucky enough to have friend that now the way of the rave to
show them.  
          Enough!  See you at Groove Kitchen!

Keep it alive and thrive!                                      T. Scot

Subject: Disco (was Re: The devolution of rave culture)

I have much the same reaction about disco that Lee does, probably
because we were fully formed adultoids during it's first incarnation and
we have painful memories of the vapidity and glitzy excess of that whole
period (Studio 54 indeed!)

Others such as AstroBoy tend to point out that we are reacting merely to
the commercialized mass-mediated tip of the iceberg, and that there was a
more underground scene every bit as cutting-edge and deep as today's
scene that we hold so dear.  Perhaps we are judging disco as unfairly as
people today who would judge techno based solely on exposure to the
Shamen or Utah Saints (or, from another direction, based solely on T99
or LA Style).

My response to this is:  I don't think so.  In any case, it's precisely
the vapid and glitzy crap that Garth, Jeno, the Hardkisses, etc. revel in
pulling out of their record boxes every so often.  Yes, I've heard some
tracks from that era I can seek my feet into, but "Celebrate" by Kool and
the Gang?
Spare us!

The argument that the DJ's know better and are pandering to the masses is simply
false -- I know from talking to them that they love the stuff as much as they
do today's hypest techno.  So I end up shrugging my shoulders and rationalizing
that for many twenty-somethings the music functions as pure nostalgia for
a time that merges via hazy early-childhood memories with the late 60's that
the rave scene is more often associated with, by way of our friend the
yellow smiley (another 70's artifact mistakenly identified with the 60's).

For my part, I'll just hold my breath, look the other way, and take the
ridiculous with the sublime.  I'll give up my deep-seated prejudices when
they pry my cold lifeless hands from them.

Another simple but often overlooked suggestion:  find a promoter you like
and volunteer to hand out flyers.  I've found this to be a terrific way to
make eye contact and start conversations with all kinds of people you'd
normally pass by.  You'll run into them at later events, and occasionally one
of you will probably remember your earlier encounter.  ;^)  A major fringe
benefit of this strategy is that for a couple of hours of your time (during
which you're having fun anyway) you'll get to go to that event for free!

Of course, all this raises the question that's come up for me after over
a year and a half of doing this (BTW, Garth's been going a bit longer than
that...) namely; just how many faces and names is it possible for a human
brain to retain, with or without the aid of smart drinks?

Well I say don't waste time trying to hold on or FIX the scene, 
It won't work just like H. Ross Perot's "fixing" of america.

You can only fix something if you have consensus and there is no
consensus in the rave world yet.
What you can do is generate the Vibe, i.e. have good quality 
parties, keep having good quality parties, support others in having
good quality parties and tell people who you are and why you are doing
it.  Don't worry about the people who don't agree with you, move on.
have outreach programs so that the true seekers can find you and leave the rest to their own devices.  Sometimes you might have to nutralize some bad
publicity though

something newer,lighter, and longer -- p.s. I'm goofy (and left footed))
Is there a strong correlation between snowboarding and raves?  There I go
being an inquisitive student again.

Well I was into Disco a little and indeed the scenes are different but
what passed for mainstream disco was just an ruse.

The real disco diva's and stars of the early era were totally eclipsed
by the donna summers and the bee gees.  

Remember Disco was the FIRST type of music to go platinum WITHOUT
air play.  It like house, came up from the black urban gay scene.

I remember going to this club in worcester massachusetts in 1976 called
the "Male Box", I and my friend were most likely the only "straight"
guys in the place,  but the place was jumpin to toons like Hit n' Run
which I guess would fall under the catagory of rare groove these days.

My friends would get this music build monster amplifiers from power
components and mount them on cardboard (they were EE majors) get out
this killer week and CRANK IT.  They would be smoked up and get into this
sorta rocking trance state.  This is the DISCO I remember, not that saturday
night fever, white boy shit!

Subject: This week's RAVE guide


	Well, if you want a glimpse at some people want you to think is
a "RAVE NEW WORLD" then the Prodigy/Moby show on Friday may be for you.
I would go mainly to hear Cybersonik (who've gotten great reviews, better
than Moby or Prodigy!) and to hear Moby "spin"... but if I were you I'd
save my energy and hit Groove Kitchen early to hit Rick Preston's set,
then cruise over to the Hardkiss party starting at 4am.  And then if you
have any energy left after the weekend, the Orb listening party beckons :)

you know I went to a gay club about three yearz ago and they were 
definately ahead of their time as far as the house/techno scene goez.
I wasn't 100% thrilled about the crowd, but the music wuz dope ! 
Maybe it'z the lack of inhibitionz in the environment that helpz
people let loose...hmmm...oh well...thatz my $.02

Subject: RE: SnOwBoArDiNg TriP!!

Well I just got in a big argument with my close minded dad (he doesnt want to
go skiing with a boarder) which means that I am available to go boarding on
this trip, arnt you lucky.  Anyone interested in going in a rental VAN with me.
 I did this last year with five guys and we all had ski equipment and gear. 
The cost all five was $25.00 including gas.  This was a lot of fun.  I
volunteer to rent the van and drive at least one way.

If this is going to happen we really need to find a place to stay, anybody have
any ideas to start how to do this.

I also suggest something in the Soda Springs area it is about 3.5-4 hours and
has sugar bowl and Donner Ski Ranch (boarder ski area). For $45.00 at Sugar
Bowl you get Rental, Lifts and Lessons.  The Rentals are really good (get there
early) I did this three times this year before I bought my boards and boots.  

Also I know Donner and Sugar Bowl are at 7000 feet and with this warm weather
rain it might be raining below that Alt.

        Spun, Ernie Munson, Jeno, Tomatsu.  11pm-7am.  177 Townsend SF.

Looks like things are heating up in the *front* of Townsend again.
Preston (Groove Kitchen, Wax, early ToonTown) has a hand in this, so it's
likely to be well- (but not over-) produced.

Also, Brian sez:

That doesn't quite work:  Smiling Thru is Saturday morning (i.e. the tail

Its a hit or miss thing at Deep Space.  I've had some great times there,
and then there were times when it was tooooooo much 'sleazoid' types.
But it is a club afterall, right?

Directions:  Get off on Guadalupe Expressway (Hwy 87) East to Julian St.
(second exit).  Go straight down Julian (to the right) and Club Oasis is
on the Left hand side several blocks down.  Its across from a park.  You
can't miss it....  [parking signs everywhere and such] If you get there
before 10pm its free.  (I beleive this is still true.)  Normally I'm
there, but tonight is not gonna happen for me.... I think next week is
going to be a lot of fun with the looks of the DJ lineup....

Have Fun

Well, just so I could say something to ya all, here goes.  First of all, my
name is Gioni Pasquinelli.  I'm up here in Davis with Zak but haven't
gotten to rave with him or any one else yet.  Been to several including Basics
Finale in December and the last one I went to was Life at the SoundFactory
(A terrible place!!) 
	Anyway, I recently went snowboarding at Bear for the
first time.  It was killer.  I pretty much got the hang of it in one day
with most of the morning spent on my butt and knees (I'm sore just
remembering it)  But it was a blast.  I'd recomend renting all your stuff, 
boots and the board, down here unless bringing it up in your cars is a
problem.  Up there the lines are huge and waiting an hour isn't uncommon. 
Also at Bear lift tickets are cheap, $25, and when I went they were
offering $5 discounts if you bought your tixs at your neighboorhood
grocery store. Right now I don't remember the name, it was like Raley's or
something, not Safeway or Lucky's but a small one.  Well, you guys can
figure it out.  I wish I could go, but midterms and finances tell me NO!
Well have fun where ever you go!!

Here's my belated take on TAZ &c.  Still haven't got real far in
Bey's book; it's sort of dense, but he's a brilliant and clear speaker.

Frist cybernetics.   Cybernetics is an academic discipline almost
unknown in the US but fully statused in some European countries.  It's
kind of the study of meta-anything, depending on who you talk to or
read, but perhaps calling it the study of dynamic systems is a decent
label.  Cybernetics studies the commonalities/ differences among
aggregated /individual behaviors in economics, or ecology, or
cultural diffusion for that matter.  Lest this sound too obscure, the
concept of 'feedback' was "cybernetic", invented by the famed Norbert
Wiener, who also coined the word.  So too the idea that causality is
not a one-way street.  WHile cybernetics is descended from operations
research by way of finding production efficiencies during WW II, it
also provides a vehicle for adding preNewtonian, Tao-oid thinking back
into the Western psyentific mind.

Now TAZ. Temporary autonomous zones.  Hakim Bey coined the phrase and
by design doens not want to define it.  So read these words and mutate
them :).  The idea seems to be that the mega-info-police-power
structure is too strong to be destroyed by direct confrontation, and
further that attempt to take it on directly result in the reproduction
of authoritarianism in the ranks of wannabe revolutionaries  ( I have
some experience with this one, being an x-marxist ).  So.... TAZ's are
semi-spontaneous self-limited events / spaces / structures that for a
while take us through the cracks in the system and dissolve before the
system can react & eradicate.  Examples cited by Bey included
internet, the rainbow gathering, quilting bees and raves.  He finds
all of them suitably unsatisfactory and doesn't mean to offer a
cookbook, just a perspective.  His ideas may not be brand new but he
presents them real well.  I was glad to be reminded that Fourier of
the Fourier Transform (signal processing) is the same Fourier who
proposed living in phalanteries ( utopian communities ).

Hope this con-fuses.

I was put off the first time I heard him (or Garth??) spin this at the
last of the first Gatherings more than a year ago.  He spun it as an
encore to one of the most intense vibes I've ever seen happen, especially
at a huge place (Fashion Center) for a commercial rave.  (Although at
the time SF raves seemed to  be just in the process of being discovered
by the crowds of people that make commercial raves difficult.  Ahhh, the
glorious days - for me the peak of the SF scene....)  I've
never seen so many people jumping, dancing, and screaming together
EVER.

Anyways, as the very last encore with the Center security at his shoulders,
waiting to carry him off if need be, he spun the Pointer Sisters Family.
I hated the tune.  We ALL went nuts.  I've loved it ever since.

I've now heard it spun at many raves from here to Alberta, many times
at Gathering/Basics events.  It seems to  be becoming a
theme song of sorts.

This is an understatement to say the least.
In fact the version that Garth played at the last Community I could
have sworn was a remix.

Also to add some info about Disco, when I was knocking about the UK
about 7 years ago, I noticed that the Brits were absolutely FASCINATED
by 70's R & B and Disco, all on the airwave they were playing
Commodores, Ohio Players, Pointer Sisters, Temptations, etc.
I thought this was odd but shrugged it off.  GArth and the like would
have been teens at the time, maybe they have schoolyard memories that
we don't share.

Subject: Deep Space/Mark Farina

I was at Deep Space last night, here are some impressions.

Spun: Spun hasn't thrilled me the last few times I heard him, but he was back
	on track last night. Y'all know what Spun sounds like, so I won't describe
	it again.

Dani: Dani has some really unusual taste in music. Her set was pretty hit and		miss. She has this strange habit of playing songs at -6 
	(songs with vocals even) which makes them sound really draggy and slow.
	It's a cool effect, but she needs to learn how to use it better. She's
	worth checking out if you're ever fiending for some different sounds.
 
Mark Farina: This guy is amazing. His records are intensely trancey. The
	songs just go on and on and never seem to change, but it never gets
	dull. Everyone on the dancefloor was completely hypnotized. 


If you get the chance, you should definitely check out Mark Farina before he 
goes back to Chicago.

On other issues, the vibe was pretty good for a club event. Hyperdelic Video
did their usual bang-up job (they seemed to have a space theme, strangely
enough). And the self-serve cups of water (from pitchers on the bar) is an
unusually good idea that I wish other events would adopt.

I believe the group in question is Sister Sledge, a Chic-produced group
none of whom were actually related. It was the Pittsburgh Pirates' theme
song in the 1979 season.

Pete, 

I know from the bitter experience of being laid-over in SLC that the
airport, at least on some nights, has no flights in or out after 10:00
PM.  This was in June, too, so bad weather wasn't the reason.
Lameness was the reason.

That town never ceases to amaze me.

I had a really good time last night at Deep Space.  Very friendly
people, minimal attitude on the dance floor.  I left a bit early
because I didn't like the last DJ (anyone?)  The guy who played from
12-1 was totally incredible, though.

Definitely a good time, and I look forward to next week (if not, the
week after).  Got in for free at around 9:30pm, and things started up
about 11pm, so that was AOK by me.

If yer wondering, I was wearing black tshirt, plaid shorts, and one of
(black toque, white hat with black rim, cat-in-the) on my noggin',
going nuts most of the night...

I totally here ya.  Being 19 and without an ID too, I totally feel left out
at times (I just ran into that last night at Deep Space - they hadn't carded 
before!  arg!).  Getting into certain clubs has been a matter of trying to
find someone on the staff I recognize and seeing if they can sneak me in, which
doesn't work 75% of the time.  

So why are so many 21+?  Simply because that's the easiest license for SF
clubs to get, so the vast majority of the clubs are that way and are 
cheapest to rent.  Sad, but true.

My personal feeling is, yeah, okay, so I can't go to Wicked, big deal; so
I can't get into Come/Unity until after 2, big deal; I've still got the
FMR's and Basics (or whatever will take their place), and it also gives me
a chance to get out of a rut and check out smaller, perhaps more underground
events too.  Of course it means everyone else who's under 21 and too lazy to
get a fake ID will be there too. :)

Curfews generally apply to people under 21.  I know that is the case here,
although we haven't enforced it.

Thanks for the Brian Eno approach to finding locations.  There is a faint
glimmer of hope now actually because I did do just that.

Deep Space continues to provide some good music for the San Josers, which
they might otherwise not have.  Cool!

Mark Farina was really intense and tribal, rocking the house hard for about 2
hours.  I will definitely see him again, maybe at Organic.  Garth was not
doing much to excite; I mean, he played good songs, but I heard most of them
at Come/Unity recently.  I guess that's what you get when you see him when
in an unfamiliar crowd.

The vibe was ok, with lots of raver types.  Of course, since it's the Oasis, 
there were the requisitie number of clubbers drinking, and a particularly mean
fight broke out at the end of the last song.  Took six folks to separate them.
It really sucked and caused everyone to leave feeling pissed off.  Even
though we do our best to spread the vibe, the drunks are too numb to receive.
Oh well.

Anyway, keep it going, all.  See you guys soon!  Someone please help me out t
though:  Advise me on Organic (at the Sound Factory on Sunday.)  Help!

I'm 37 (dare I admit it?!) and think the 21+ rule sucks the way big one.
Yunnow, in spite of having a GREAT time at King St. last Saturday at GK,
I noticed a few barflies hanging around and just drinking, not getting
into the dancing much at all, blundering through the floor.  I'm not
one for enforcing conformity at all, but the booze just seems to dampen
the scene.  And I still like a good beer, just not something I care to
partake of generally at a good show or dancehall scene.  When they opened
the bar up at 6 or 7 or whenever it was, a good half dozen at King 
immediately flocked to it.  sigh . . .

The net effect is that we miss out having a significant portion of the
scene at GK and other 21+ events.  It does make a diff.

There is a ragga version of We are Family that kicks as well. Also, my take
on disco/70's funk is that it is firmly embedded in the genesis of house
music culture. So many people are stuck in their "Disco Sucks" stances from
when it went bad at the end of the 70's.. House, however, is also dance music
and while it is definitely a new branch, it is part of the same tree. Chicago
house was a nod at the Philly disco sound as much as it was its own thing..
Tastefully integrated selected disco can be sooo good! Lord, what a bunch of
poorly connected ideas. Ok, disco -> house.. Disco Sucks poses -> drop 'em
noone gives a shit anymore. We don't have to deal with gaudy cocaine laden
night clubs and all of the tired shit that went with the downfall of disco.
We are Family is a great song about unity and damn if it doesn't have soul.

Subject: 21+


There has been a movement in the punk scene (whatever that is) to boycott
places that enforce 18+ or 21+ limits.  Fugazi, to pick a famous example, 
will not play anyplace with an age limit.  They also won't play if the ticket
price is more than $5.  As a result, lots of annoying places miss out on 
getting $5000+ at the door because they want the bar receipts.

I like this idea.  The genesis of raves, as I see them, was as a form of
TAZ not subject to the normal laws and social rules.  When we go to a 21+
club, we are making several statements:
1) Alcohol is cool, while other drugs are not.
2) Anyone under 21 has no business dancing or having fun.
3) The System (tm) is just fine, and we can satisfy our desires by putting
   our money in the right place within it.

Sure, Deep Space is neat, but wouldn't you rather have or go to a _really
good_ house party?  Maybe your living circumstances make this difficult,
and you now have to consider that the current system of piling as many people
as close together as possible in nearly identical boxes MIGHT NOT BE GOOD,
and that's scary.  Easier just to go clubbing- but less satisfying.

Mark Farina?!  Trancy?!?!?  Man, I guess he's really flexible with 
conforming to the crowd's tastes; when i heard him at a rave in Chicago
he was playing aleph-null bpm hawdcoh stuff like every other Chi-town DJ.

	it's another *bad vibes* story!  yay!!  this time
	it's the sound factory...

	my housie gave me some passes and we ventured off
	to see what all the hubbub was about this big new 
	place.  the guy at the guestlist door told me that
	i could *not* go itno the club because i was
	wearing *tennis shoes*.  we were miffed, and took
	a few minutes to think of what else we should do.

	we went back to talk to him about it.  he said it 
	wasn't his rule.  i asked him if he felt comfortable
	enforcing rules that are exclusionary, he got a 
	little confused, but did not really see the situation
	as we were seeing it, on a broader scale.  besides
	the fact that how there be *techno* in a place in
	san francisco that diddn't allow my cool vans...!
	susie pressed him on some more issues, he told me that
	he diddn't want to insult me, but they sometimes have 
	a problem with "punks" trying to get in.  punks??!!
	"no no no no" he said, thinking i was insulted and
	therefore must think he "called" me a punk, "i know
	the grunge look is in and all..."  what??!!  
	"well the club has to maintain an image..."  
	oh gawd.  he pointed to other sneaker clad people
	who were on the guestlist.  "they aren't going in
	either, because of their tennis shoes."  the guy
	he pointed out responded to that by saying "well
	i don't play tennis in these shoes."  my friend the	
	bouncer then said "well he's not coming in at all
	if he gives me that kind of attitude, i can do that."

	so these other guys start arguing with the other bouncer,
	about shoes.  they all had british accents, all four of them,
	three in sneakers.  "we are not going to change our shoes,
	we just got off the plane from london, we are from virgin
	records.  that is why we are on the guestlist.  we are not
	going to fly home for *shoes*," she hissed.  then i remembered
	that all the record [eople are in town for the gavin
	convention.  i looked at my bouncer and announced for
	everyone to hear "if they go in, i go in.  no compromise."
	frustrated, my bouncer gave me the ticket and tried to hustle
	me by.  susie glared at me.  i handed him the ticket as she
	said "we don't want to dance with you people anyway."

	i have not had anyone try to impose that rule on me since
	my parochial grammar school days.  i don't want to hang
	out with people why obey the rules.  especially

Subject: Portland 2Night

So it looks like the rave scene has really arrived in Portland.  Maybe
I'm just dense or had bad luck before, but things have completely turned
around since the last event I went to about six months ago.

Tonight was split between the main event, 'Love Strange' at La Luna
(formerly the Pine St. Theatre and other names).  Hell, what it really
was was the Pine St *Garage*.  I got in around 1 am ($12 cover, pretty
cool), to find my old stompin' ground from many years past completely
packed.  I mean, this was a bit o' kulchir schok to the ole noggin'
after a decade of concerts ranging from Hot Tuna, Alpha Blondy, the
Seldom Scene, Dharma Bums, and many others . . . 

Actually it started even earlier when I found a flyer for this rumored
event and discovered than none other than Doc Martin was on the bill.
And then later ran across the Good Doctor at one of the local record
emporiums.  But I digress.

The 'theatre' is actually an old church annex with a big concert/dance
area and lots of small spaces, including a schoolroom sized one converted
to a combo coat check'n'chill area, also with a series of good DJs.
Before breaking away at 6 we heard a variety of DJs including Aaron and
Doc from LA, D-Lyte from Seattle and Brad Vachal from Portland.  A fine
and varied selection overall.  Doc wasn't quite the groovemeister he
was last Saturday night at Groove Kitchen, but he only had an hour so
he just had about hit stride when his slot timed out.  D-Lyte did a great
housey trancey set to close out.  It really did have that 5 am 135 bpm
feeling to it.

I checked out the afterparty downtown at 333 Park Ave (formerly the
Underground and a bunch of other names).  In the last couple of months,
the booking policy at both Park Ave and La Luna have changed, and it
has clearly spurred the growth of a scene in the making.  While I've
been away a lot plumbing the depths of the SF club scene, things have
been very quietly gaining ground in my hometown!  

The age distribution is toward the younger end of the scale compared to
SF.  There is a long history of division between the over-18 and under-18
scenes here, and it shows.  The sound was loud at la luna but somewhat
disappointing, I'm definitely spoiled by the advanced concepts being used
in the Bay Area where separate subwoofers are considered part of the
standard toolkit.  It makes a big difference.  But I'm not complaining too
much, it was certainly adequate for the cause here.

Tomorrow our newest record store opens.  It's a merger of two other really
cool places, the Ooze and Outer Limits.  So of course they are calling it
the Ozone.  

A very auspicious weekend for Portland!

Picked up a few flyers which I'll post separately.  Looks like Moonpup will
be in Seattle next Saturday, maybe we'll get a visit too.  Doc and Aaron
and the crew from tonight will be in Seattle Saturday night at a warehouse
near the Ballard Locks.

I'm very happy about all this.  Looks like we've got a vibrant scene 
at last!

location is the Sound Factory.  Oh well.  We'll check it out, and see what
it is all about, and, if lame, will go to 1015 Folsom or something.  The
DJ lineup for organic looks good:  Garth, Jeno, Jon Williams, etc. and Mark
Farina, who tore it up at Deep Space Thursday night.  I wann go to this one
because I would like to catch Mark Farina again.... so anyway, if any of
you want to go, post here and I'll get back to you tomorrow.

Besides, if enough of us goes to this thing, there will be enough vibe spread

So it turns out Carlos was here in Portland the night of the FMR.
The 333 Park Ave scene is happening weekly now with, it appears, at
least two and possibly three different production teams using it.
It's a fairly small space, say the size of the upstairs main room
at 1015 Folsom.  Decently loud speaker stacks, but no subwoofers
(I am starting my campaign to have those installed *yesterday* ;-).

Neither Park Ave nor La Luna have alcohol at these events, which is
really great.  One of the reasons my experience last night was so
much better than last summer here.  Anyway, here's the scoop . . .

Subject: Prodigy/Moby at Fashion Center


The first thing I have to say about this performance is THE PRODIGY SUCKED!!!!
Their act was completely staged.  I got NO energy whatsoever from their
set.  In fact, I could hardly hear the music with the "singer"(I guess you
could call him that) screaming "YAH SAN FRANCISCO!" and other annoying
phrases over and over and over and over until I thought I was going to
scream.  The only time his voice sounded okay was during "Fire", which
actually has vocals.  All this plus the fact that I was under the
influence of heavy psychedelics made me realize that I now hate the Prodigy.

MOBY, on the other hand, blew me away.  Unlike the Prodigy's staged, fake
attitude, Moby came across as truly energetic and willing to do anything
to pass the energy on to the crowd.  And the music...  I think my mind has
been permanently altered.  Moby rules all.

As for the D.J.'s, I think I enjoyed SpaceTime's performance in the
chill-room most of all.  They can combine turntables with live music so
perfectly.  It was beautiful - pure ambience.

Overall, the crowd mainly sucked (but that was expected), the Prodigy
SUCKED, Moby rules and so does SpaceTime.  I would not have paid to get
in, but I got in free, so it was definitely worth my time.  
Anyone else go???   			       __|__

Saturday morning a number of co-conspirators and I checked out Smiling Thru.
Mark Farina was disappointing, but Robbie and Scott shredded and more than
made up.  Club O is a good place for an afterparty -- it's a bit weird
dancing on plexiglas over the swimming pool, and the sound system is less
than wonderful, but there's lots of natural light and no garish art like
DNA, and you can chill outside in the fresh air and watch the sunrise.

Last night I helped Malachy do the chill room at Funky Techno Tribe.  It was
your typical commercial large-scale rave, but they at least put some effort
into the environment with a bamboo-hut and potted plant motif.  I couldn't
take the main floor for more than ten minutes at a time, but the groove
room was pretty good, with Harry Who and Ernie spinning.  I didn't have lots
of dance energy, so I mostly hung around the chill space.

This afternoon Anne F. and I went to the park thing that absolutely, positively
was supposed to take place but didn't.  Then went to Zanzibar which was
absolutely, positively supposed to happen but didn't.  We ended up at Giamma
and Jonathan's.  Debated going to the "Attitude Factory" (tm) but I think
I'll check in at vrave instead -- at least I can wear my tennis shoes!

Yeah,
	THE PRODIGY SUCKED!! and so did the rest  of the rave.
	I have a lot of mixed feelings about this.
	I a way I sorta see this type of thing as the future of
	raving and it is sorta sad.  I think some kids will never
	get to go to a "real" rave cuz this will be all that is left
	if we allow the authorities to really surpress the underground
	one or just allow "rave" to be held by the same people who
	control the "liquor and entertainment" venues in this area.
	I have heard that as far as San Francisco is concerned,
	the policy is if you get your permits, fine, pay your money
	and we will send a bunch of undercovers, and if your not
	holding a drug party you'll have nothing to worry about.  If you
	don't get the proper permits, we'll bust you quickly.  So, if this
	happens, all that will be left will be "sanctioned" raves like 
	this one.

	I knew I was in trouble when I had to submit to a substantial

I wasn't there but I'm sure he wasn't joking.  As you probably know, guns
are an integral part of their uniforms in the U S of A.

Cops have been showing up at parties even in clubs here at random.  At one
of them (that was 21+) they started asking random people for their ID's
and found several underage, and slapped a hefty fine on the club owners.
This is one reason why doormen have been much more intransigent about ID's
lately.

There's an even subtler form of harrassment they're pulling that really gets
me tweaked -- in the vicinity of two of the more well-known and established
scene venues (including the one that received the raid I just mentioned) they
declared No Parking zones from 2-6am EVERY DAY (including holidays) for
street cleaning on both sides of the street.  Now if you know San Francisco,
especially South of Market, virtually all streets are No Parking for several
hours *two* or *three* days a week (excluding holidays), the days alternating
from one side of the street to the other, so there's always some all-night
parking within a block of where you want to go.  It's amazing that they would
bother to be so petty as to force a few dozen people to park a block or two
further away and think that's going to make a difference.  It would be
interesting to hang outside some Saturday night and see if they *really*
clean both sides of the street...

i wanted to attend SMILING THRU, the new afterparty (although it's not
really quite after, more like a sort of late-during-party) at the
Oasis.  it started at 4 AM and i am quite a wimp so i went to bed at
10 pm and woke up at 3 in order to be awake enough to function.

this was a good move although it lent quite a surreal tinge to my day,
since it really messed up my biological clock.

anyway.  the Oasis is a nice little space with a cool egyptian motif
in the outer room.  the inner room is mainly dominated by a swimming
pool which was covered, creating a dance floor.  they have a very
decent sound system - i forget who posted that it was crap, but i would
like to go on record as disagreeing with that.  i didn't use or need
earplugs the whole time.

you can go also up on the roof, which has chairs and tables.  it's a
nice place to hang out.

we arrived to hear jon williams doing his usual brilliant thang.
heavy into the hip hop funky break motif for a while, ending up in
almost total disco land (which didn't thrill me).  jon was obviously
not too pleased with his set cos when i tried to compliment him on it,
he gave me a withering look of derision that made me want to slink
under a rock and die.

in the outer room, a fellow named graeme was spinning a neat set of
slow, grooving tracks, including a song that i had been in love with
for something like 10 months now.  i finally managed to find out the
name of it, so i'm a happy guy.

mark farina, special guest DJ from chicago, took over after jon.  i
just don't understand what the big deal is.  two of my best friends
think he's god's personal DJ, but it just goes right over my head.
his mixing skills are unimpeachable, but the stuff he plays leaves me
cold.

anyway, a big thumbs up for smilin' thru at the oasis.  although it
never got particularly crowded or hopping, it was a fun relaxed place
to hang out and i would definitely go there again.

i didn't sleep on saturday because my internal clock was messed up
from having woken up at 3 am.  so i just puttered around the house
being productive until it was time for groove kitchen.  i'm getting
royally bored of king street, but rick preston was spinning early and
it was his birthday, so we figured we'd best pop in and say hello and
happy birthday.  of course, it doesn't hurt that he's a great DJ and
(sadly) one of the most underappreciated talents in the bay area.
he really takes off when he's got a crowd to play to, and
unfortunately there just weren't that many people there for the first
few hours of his set.  around 1 AM, the place started to pack and the
dance floor vibe took off.  rick warmed to the crowd instantly and his
set hit a really high energy peak.  he says he's going to be getting
better slots, so hopefully the city will have a chance to really see
what he's made of.

after rick, robbie hardkiss came on.  i was falling over at this point
due to the aforementioned internal clock weirdness, so i left.
friends on the inside tell me that robbie was absolutely incredible.

i contemplated going to sound factory last night but i didn't actually
get there.  it sounds like i might have to actively avoid that place
if the letters on sfraves are anything to go on...

Yeah, I guess that although I know that US cops are always armed, it
just hasn't really sunk in.  

I've never been to any of the big commercial raves, but from newspaper
reports, I gather that at the big licenced raves in the UK, the police
charge many tens of thousands of pounds to pay for the large police
presence that is usually a condition of an entertainments licence
being granted.  Some police forces have made standing recommendations
to the licencing comittees to refuse all applications for raves, on
the grounds that they are `supermarkets for drugs', though the
licensing comittees often ignore the recomendation, fearing that
refusing the licences will just drive raves further underground.
Judging by recent newspaper reports, the cops search people at random
for drugs, and usually find drugs on over a third of the people they
search.

There was a report in the local paper this weekend about a local rave
at which exactly this happenned -- I could type it in if there's
interest.

No no joke.  To be specific, there were two "security guards".  They
did not wear San Francisco Police Uniforms.  They did wear police cut
"blah blah Security Force" uniforms complere with emblem, police style
comm devices, handcuffs and 9MM autos.  As far as I'm concerned, a cops
a cop, whether "mercenary" or on the payrole of the State.  There was
no question in my mind that they didn't have the power to arrest me or shot
me if I posed a significant threat. 
 I think we have to beware of the tactic of "good cop/bad cop"
Good Cop's get part time work for concert security forces or for BGP 
productions they may or may not be interested in "busting" the scene or
specificly certain types of drug use.  Some are on a "mission" and feel
that they must fight for truth justice and the american way but by and
large just want to make a little money, this is easier than doing hip-hop
concerts and maybe they are curious.  These people are good people to
enter into "liasons" with but you still should remember that they are
cops and ultimately they are representing Authority.
Bad Cops are the guys that know raves are drug crazed parties that some
of the kids go to where a lot of fags, gook and niggers go as well and that
the dance all night to that satanic techno shit. Not in my city!  These
guys got out of hand in Milwaukee.

I guess what the best thing to do is to have some form of communication
between law enforcement and the raver communities.  Maybe we should seek
out "open-minded" cops to have dialogs with.

Actually, armed security guards scare me much more than "real Kops".  These
goofballs are usually fat old ex-cops w/a chip on their shoulder.

It's funny but there really are some open-minded cops.  I wouldn't
have believed it [cops traditionally hate me, I even got a M.I.P. on
the week of my 21st birthday] but some of them are really professional
about things, not just bigoted dickheads o' the state.  Geoff may be
right, talking to some/certain cops about things may be a good idea.
At least they could cut us some slack in their jurisdiction! :-)

Well, I was at both Deep Space on Thursday Night and Smiling Thru on Sat
morning. Mark Farina's set was completely different at the two events.
It sort of makes sense, actually. The set he played Thursday night from 
12-2 a.m. would not have worked in the 6:30 a.m. time slot he played on
Saturday morning.

I'm really curious to hear from anyone who went to Organic last night.
What time slot did Mark Farina play in and what kind of music did he play?

And what about Derek Carter (another Chicago DJ who was supposed to play 
Organic)? He's playing Deep Space this Thursday night.

Hi:

Enclosed is an article that was in last weeks Metro (Santa Claras Weekly
Newspaper).  I am sure that most of you have read this in other papers, I have
already heard about it.

--------------Beginning of Artical-----------------------------

Dance Till You Drop!!

Fifteen dead in the last two years. The victims? Devotees of England's rave
countercultute.  The culprit? The drug MDMA, a.k.a. Ecstasy.  It seems that,
before dropping dead during an unplanned "danse mortise", the late young Brits
had popped a few caps of the fashionable pharmaceutical- promoted by users as a
benign "love drug".
  Not so, says Dr. John Henry of that country's National Poisons Unit in an
article in the British Medical Journal, Lancet synopsized in the Journal of
American Medical Association's Sept. 23, 1992, Issue.
     The deceased had taken the drug at clubs during popular all-night dance
sessions called "raves". While dancing they began to experience convulsions and
soon collapsed unconscious.  By the time anyone noticed and called the medics,
their temperatures had hit 110 degrees, their pulces raced and blood pressure
plummeted.
   Had they OD'd? No.  In fact most had taken only a few tablets, while fellow
party goers swallowing as much or more swallowing as much or more suffered only
"hangovers" and hypertension.
    Henry beleives that prolonged dancing may compound the effects of a drug
that has been shown to increase body temperature in rats. add Poorly 
ventilated dance floors and dehydration and "you have everything needed to
elevate body temperature to lethal levels in susceptible individuals," he says.
    So far, there have been no published reports of MDMA induced deaths in this
country. But, caveat emptor, because now it's documented.  Given the right mix,
"Rave" rhymes with "Grave"

and overexertion caused by _not_getting_enough_water_, not by taking the
E.  The writer can take his "danse mortise" and stick it in his ear.

	or somptin' else

I want aware, uplifting, informative articles (I'll take care of the
gloom and doom stuff).  You don't have to believe in luv-phasors to write
something.  This zine is designed to spark thought and imagination for
the average and not so average raver, sorta like an utne reader/whole earth
review but centered around the rave community.  You techno guys might
like to give an article of the future of techno music, or the psychoacoustics
of techno or something like that. anyway send submissions of ascii, or 
artwork for that matter to me.  It become the zine's property but I promise
not to edit it substantially without first passing the edited version back
to you for approval.

As far as artwork is concerned, PostScript is best but I guess GIFs and TIFFs
are ok as well.  Please make arrangements with me BEFORE you send a 
300k PS or image file.

Send all entries to:

The deadline to go into the equinox issue is  FEB 24.

the wc command for a typical article looks like...

     98     718    4164 ponder.1
I especially want to hear from female ravers, especially female DJs

We really need good poems

We will run adds in exchange for the store agreeing to sell the zine by
buying a certain number upon delivery.  I.e. 20@ .50 an issue = $10
(stand price is $1)

All money will go into desemination and making to magazine good.

I am totally opposed to private security forces carrying guns on public
property, as do the rent-a-cops hired by the downtown business association
in Portland.  Which led to a tragic killing of a purse-snatching thief
last summer right outside my office.  There are often no guidelines for
training and skill maintenance by these 'security' people.  Concomitantly,
there is often no training in nonviolent techniques to diffuse tension
rather than simply isolate a supposed troublemaker to focus on.

Security guards can carry guns on private property, but I would have
second, and then third thoughts, about being at any public event with
anyone other than a fully uniformed police officer having a gun.  In
most cases I don't want to see them either.  I don't know how I'd
react if this situation just happened to me, but looking at it from
this distance I think it would be a very short trip to the exit
followed by a letter from me *and* my lawyer.  And better ten letters
than one.

There may be some private security people carrying guns who know how
and when to use them properly, but I am nervous even about police officers
universally having them, and they have far better training, backup,
experience and legal guidelines and restrictions in using force.

Look at that another way.  If you don't like the way police usually
behave, just look at the walking time bomb most armed security guards

Subject: Rave -- The Board Game?!

  I suppose we all have our own pet "the end of raving is at hand" theories --
UF ORB played at junior high dances, Time magazine coverage, Bridge and Tunnel
invasions, etc.  I confess I laughed at them all -- until I walked into
Housewares on Haight Street and saw a RAVE board game.  It's reviewed in the
latest URB magazine (#25), so I won't recapitulate; but a board game for raving?
Has the sedentary, weak-imagination mind set come to the rave world? This isn't
virtual reality: it's virtually sapheaded braincandy.
  Or are there folks out here who find it a thrill? Give it a review here, and 
I'll (maybe) retract my "the end of raving is at hand" gloomsaying.

well - i think it was mark farina who was slotted from about when i arrived atOrganic til about 2ish. if it was mark he looked like he was 17... is he? that would make me feel lame, but i can handle it. he played a pretty deep set. between him and the guy following him who couldn/t mix for shit - unbelievable!!!! it was like todd terry night at sound factory, but i was happy cause i knew most of the songs for a change and i/ll resist the urge for another shallow shameless plug. big peace shots out to mike, zac, john, and niels.... great ta see ya all. and shots out to to mark and tracy if they/re reading this from future forums open computer night tonight.... i bummed i can/t get off this mit of the west alcatraz tonight. ohh well. i should be doing work so i can graduate anyway :( {how do i make a mope/ self-pity face}

furthermore the acid jazz room really wasn/t. it was more like an instrumental hip-hop cut room, at least the times i was there. the only thing that moved the sounds to anything i would play on my show was when i introduced myself to johnny v who seems like a nice guy and told him stuff i did, and he decided to dig some good tunes out of the crate, but that seemed to clear the floor so back to "homey got shut" the  deep blunt instrumental mix...

as one person said, sound factory is "hella clubby". i would have to agree. although the space is like this neat tweaked doll house...

when garth finally took over, he saved the party and i think this was one of those rare nights where his set was actually stronger than jeno/s. although jeno is still a genius and can really attach the music to the vibe. but, hell, i like garth a whole lot and am always glad to hear him just go crazygonuts. the new music they all bought on firday for the prodigy show really helped, but jeno still hasn/t rotated out the conga song and the ba dah ee dah song (cool).

the energy really improved towards the wee hours, and the sfravers still there seemed to really be trying to pump the crowd and it was working :) i however was largely a big raving blob, extremly tired and with head cold. so my love phasers were pretty much on clog. but i made it to the end of the evening and that was a moral victory. peace. pat

I read about the Rave board game three years ago in the British music tabloids. 
It's a shame to see the money grubbers leeching off "the latest trend." 
However, I think that Dr. Alex Patterson from The Orb composed some special
tunes for a limited-edition tape that was included in the first release of the
game.  A game with a soundtrack; it's about time.

Does the game still come with an Orb tape?

Does anyone have it?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Marathon Ravewear: Results

 About a week ago, I made a request for recommendations for raving 
shoes, to save my poor 9 1/2" feet from further agony after 4 to 5 
hours of dancing. 

Short Results:
 Doc Martens
 Red Wings
 Bright Yellow Airwalks
 Other

------

 The majority of respondents were for Doc Martens:
------
 "Well I am another big Doc Martin Fan, I have had mine for 7 years now. 
... I wear them everywhere and they are the most comfortable pair of 
shoes I own.  After a while my feet do get soar because there is no 
arch support in them but that can be fixed easily."

 "The best thing about my shoes is that I can go anywhere and Raving 
takes you to some strange places.  they are perfect for Raves in Fields,
muddy places.  They also came in handy go into the flooded bathroom at 
the Gathering Rave."
------
 "I wear size 9 1/2 and I think my Docs are wonderful."
------
 "i got a pair of doc marten's (don't think that story about them not
being available in half sizes is true) more recently and although they
took forever to break in, they are quite comfortable now and i don't
have any problems raving in them."
------
> docs kick ass!  .....
> they get soft fast and get real comfortable, and support your
> ankles during the marathon sesh...
> 
> and they will last you for years!!
> 
> try some on...they might fit your 9.5s better than you think!

"I have to second that to the umpteenth power ! dox are the shit !
picked up a pair in NY when I went to see the east coast ne-raves
posse and I've been dancing my ass off in em since...comfortable
as hell !"
------
"<Doc's> come in full sizes only. Keep in mind that if you purchase DM's
in the US you'll have to decrease your shoe size by one (e.g. a DM 10 
is actually an 11)."

"Getting a boot that fits can be tricky. Use your "sneaker" size as a 
guideline, but be prepared to try on +/-1 sizes. My foot is an 11 but I 
have boots in 10, 11 and pretty soon, 12. I just bought some DM's in 
size 11 (US) but they tore my feet up. I'll have to return them for a 
size 12. Thank god I didn't make it to the Spiral rave in them..."
------
"1. waterproof
 2. easy to clean"
----------------------------------
----------------------------------
Not everybody likes Doc's:
------
"And doc martens? Fuck 'em. I (sheepishly) admit to having a pair for
certain situations -- pretentious whine-and-cheeze art openings, trendo
industrial music events, clubs that don't let you in cuz your shoes are
too scruffy, hang-yerself-upside-down-by-yer-scrotum-n-cover-with-whip-
cream-while-making-animal-noises performance-art schticks -- But they
suck for dancing. THey may look oh-so trendy, but they're not really as
comfortable as a good nerdy walking shoe for the long-haul. "
---------------
---------------

The Redwing brand got some recommendations too:

------
"I was going to buy some Docs, but my neighbors convinced me that 
Redwings are better.  They come in all sizes, and *widths*, and the 
store owners are usually more interested in getting you a good fit 
rather than making a buck .  I bought a pair of steel toe boots that 
I've been really happy with.  I used to dance in a lower pair of softer 
leather boots, but these boogie just as well if I tie the laces around 
the ankles.  I don't know if Docs have steel toes, but these are 
seriously nice for moving things around, kicking ice off your car (big 
problem in SF, I know), and although I haven't jumped into a pit with 
them yet, I'd imagine my toes won't suffer the same fate that they have 
in the past."
------
"if I expect to be dancing in an obnoxious crowd, I sometimes wear 
steel-toed Red Wings. Great for slam dancing. "
------
"Yes, Redwings are the move my friends! These are perhaps the most 
comfortable boots that I have ever worn, and they fit soooo well... 
mmmmmmmm... boots..."
"The store is a definite trip as well! "
"...steeltoe so you can kick in telLIEvision screens, and FREE 
waterproofing. If they are oiled leather, you can bring them in anytime 
and get them re-oiled. Free. Quite a pitch, huh?"
-------------
*************
My experience:
 I just visited a Red Wing store nearby - a good fitting steel toe shoe 
with ankle support goes for $144. Good thick leather and padding, 
comfort support insole. 
 I walked across the street to Valley Fair mall, and they indeed have
Doc Martens at Kinneys, right alongside the Doc Marten copies! Kinney's
has always been the copycat king of shoestores, but putting the
(cheaper) copies next to the orginals takes some gall! 
 Anyway, I put my 9 1/2 into a DM 9 ( too loose ), and a DM 8 ( width
OK, but length kinda strange still ). I was told the price was normally
$99, but it was the last night of the President's Day sale, so I could
get 'em for $89. Well, I demurred, and it's too late to go back now!
 Well, I may do the Yank chauvinist thing, and buy Red Wings. Support
the manufacturing economies of Minnesota and Santa Cruz, get a great (?)
pair of shoes, and expiate some of my guilt from buying a Toyota pickup 
truck instead of a Ford.
*************
-------------
-------------

And other brands too:
------
"Bright Yellow Airwalks... almost always. (hi-top support & comfort, 
w. vents) Half sizes... yep"
------
"Bright Yellow Airwalks    (they match my feathers)"
------
"I wear a pair of black Nike Air cross-trainers more often
than not.  You get better lateral stability out of these
things than you would out of some running shoes, but they've
got the padding that is crucial for saving your joints, in
particular your knees. 

It's harder to do spins and slides in them unfortunately,
but I don't recommend wearing leather soled shoes.  There's
a good friend of mine who always wears leather shoes who is
now having some serious knee problems now that he's in his
late thirties. "
------
<For gals...>
"I have one pair of ankle boots that I wear to raves everywhere and 
absolutely love.  They have nice thick flexible non-slip rubber soles
and running-shoe like support inside.  They're black leather and suede,
and lace up.  The brand name is "Jump," which I believe is made by
the same people who make Keds.  They sell mens' styles, too."
------
"when i first started raving, i went out and bought a pair of fila
basketball shoes - ultra padded.  they are bouncy and very comfortable."
------

"Basically, I recommend "graduate student and/or geek shoes", e.g.
Rockport Pro-Walkers or Clarks Air-Walkers. They're pretty expensive,
but they're worth it. I especially recommend Brown Rockports :-). 

The above assumes that you're not a fashion-conscious raver (like me).
I care more about comfort than looks. I'd rather be able to dance for 6
hours straight than have fashionable-looking feet. (Which are just
going to get scuffed up dusty/grungy anyways). Besides, any fashionable
raver knows that wide shoelaces are where it's really at..."

"My current rave faves are my ol' Clarks' Air Walkers ($100) which I
bought in the UK a few years ago. They're great, offering just the
right amount of cush, and they slide just enough w/o being
out-of-control slippery when wet. Rockports, on the other hand, turn
into ice-skates when the floor gets wet." < And I can vouch for that -
when Vibram soles get worn out, they're damn slippery>

"For Outdoor raves? Cordura-fabric lightweight hiking boots."
------
"PLATFORM SNEAKERS!!!!!"
------
"Well, being as I'm a "vigorous" dancer...
	It might seem odd, but I wear jazz shoes because well
Nothing else seems to keep my wittle feeties from hurting and I don't
want something like a little pain to keep me from dancing!
They're just sleek little leather shoes...you barely feel them
and they're not very expensive."
------
"There is a common shoe store here called Kinneys.
Well they sell normal generic shoes BUT! last summer and maybe
still they had absolutely beautiful purple suede shoes. They
are built like tennis shoes so they are absolutely comfortable.
I believe they were surprisingly cheap ie $25 or $35. I think they
had some other really solid colors also... btw it may have been
kenneys.. one of those mall stores."
------
"For club, warm cozy raves, I wear nike hightop "aerobics"
	shoes, these are not really "aerobics" shoes any more and have
	been modified for general purpose "urban chump" wear.
	They are light and I've had my pair for almost 2 years..."
"For "Hardcore" environments, like the FMR, and dirty wet warehouses
	like the gathering on NY eve, I have a pair of Hi-Tek Magnums,
	They are lighter than docs, (but less "stylish" unlike you like
	the military look), just as rugged but are not all leather, they
	get more and more comfortable as the days go by.  They provide
	GREAT ankle support and good protection from the elements,
	people stepping on your feet, etc.  They are also a more stable
	platform on uneven surfaces than the nikes, they cost about $80
	at Vally Fair mall ( in San Jose, behind the Silicon Curtain :)"
------
"And my other raving shoes are "Romeo King" bedroom slippers. These are 
the type of slippers that fools used to lounge in with their silk 
smoking jackets and all of that 30's jive. The soles are leather, and 
slide around quite nicely, but are probably bad for the ankles.."
------
"I have had the same pair of shoes for over a year... a pair of suede 
Ellesse (black).  You can get them in green, purple, yellow, etc. 
They are super-comfy, and the soles are pretty good as far as 
adhesion.  Since I've had mine for so long, I've worn through the 
soles at some parts and the foam underneath is a bit slippery. "
------
"I've been wearing Reebok's walking shoes ("Boks") for several months 
now.Black suede and super-comfy. They don't have the best traction but 
are great if you're on the dance floor for several hours. I think I paid 
about $60 for mine."

Raid on ravers nets drugs

A drugs haul recovered by police at a massive weekend rave was just
the tip of the iceberg, according to the man who led the security
operation.

Private security guards searched all the 4,800 revellers arriving at
the pay party in a warehouse at Salter's Way, Wisbech.  Police carried
out a random search of about 250 ticket holders---and recovered more
than L30,000 of drugs.

Police found quantities of Crack, amphetamine and a ``large amount''
of Ecstasy, said Supt Peter Bullen, who led the squad of more than 80
officers.

He said: ``What we found was only the tip of the drugs iceberg.  I
will leave it to people's own imagination to work out how much we
would have found had we searched everyone at the event.''

117 people were arrested, 25 were taken to police stations around the
venue, 16 were released pending ``analysis of various substances
siezed at the rave''.

Two were released without charge and the rest were cautioned.

And Supt Bullen said local authority licensing panels should consider
the amount of drugs recovered when considering applications for future
events.

He said: ``I would urge any local authorities which receive
application for similar events not to grant them---these events are
drug parties not rave parties---I would ask them to be perfectly
satisfied about the safety of this type of event before giving the
go-ahead.''

A spokesman for the party organisers, Fenstanton-based Dance
International, said: ``We think the police over-reacted.''

Subject: Re: Killer E.

Just to play devil's advocate for the moment...

Although we can say that overexhaustion and dehydration was the immediate
cause of death, it's quite likely that excessive MDMA was a catalyst for the
metabolic breakdown, or at least helped impair the judgement of the poor
ravers who were perhaps too tranced out to consider taking a break.  If you
disagree, ask yourself why there have been no reports of this happening to
people not under the influence (or have there been???).

The article says:

> Had they OD'd?  No.  In fact most had taken only a few tablets...

A few tablets?  Depending on body weight anything more than 1-1/2 or 2 is
considered excessive according to most of the literature I've seen.

There is some evidence that in rare instances people may suffer allergic
reactions to MDMA.  Someone I know personally took it once for her first
time -- one hit -- and experienced severe convulsions and eventually blacked
out.  She is physically fairly small, so for her one hit was clearly excessive.

I also saw a girl shivering uncontrollably and unable to walk unassisted
once at a FMR -- she had taken four hits (!).

Although "War on Drugs" propagandists deny it, there is a difference between
use and abuse of any substance, including alcohol, caffeine, aspirin, etc.
The analogy with car accidents is apt -- automobiles like any other technology
have benefits and associated risks.  We accept the risks because we believe
the benefits outweigh them.  It goes without saying that the driver killed in
a car crash would still be alive if not for driving the car.  On the other
hand, if she was driving 90 MPH her odds of being killed are much higher than
if she were acting responsibly.

I completely agree that the Metro article was incredibly bad journalism,
and they deserve a fierce round of letters.  But let's not go overboard and
claim that excessive MDMA use had nothing to do with these deaths.  Try to
keep things in perspective.

I'd never advocate any kind of illegal activity, but remember -- less is more.
Be careful.

So your saying that there were these two guys in the nightclub, who

I think the idea of armed provate security guards scares me even more
than the idea of armed police.

So just exactly what _are_ you allowed to do with guns in the US?  I
gather that anyone can buy a gun.  But are you allowed to carry it
around with you in the street?  Take it into public places?  Can
anyone just walk into a nightclub with a gun, assuming the bouncers

geez, it's not THAT bad.  the game was obviously written by people in
the scene.  it's fairly brit-centric tho.  you sort of have to know
the history and style of british raving to really "get" it.
unfortunately, there are about 8 bazillion rules and it's a highly
UNPLAYABLE game.  in the sense of, "once you figure out the procedure
for moving, you ask yourself `why the hell am i bothering with this
waste of time!!!???'"

most of the time you spend driving all over the place looking for
clues on how to find a rave that isn't actually busted.  it's hard for
us modern computer geekoids to sympathize with that, given the
incredible excellence of brian's rave calendar.  hell, it's become a
weekly ritual for me to print that sucker out on thursdays just in
case my weekend plans fall through.  i guess things are different in
ole blighty...

once you get to a rave in the game, you get to pick up dance cards and
drop E, and do all that fun stuff.  you have to get dance cards that
add up to 120 BPM or something and eventually you get all these pieces
and you are The Winner.

but the main problem is not the commercialization of rave or whatever
- it's that the game is just boring!!

Well, not sure why event are becoming 21+, but I have been to raves where
they had a "stoopid" bar and of course serving booze warrants ID.  The only
other thing I can think of is that perhaps the people that own the spaces
require that those who attend said event must be at least 21.  This helps
avoid any legal problems with angry parents.  Also - even if they are not
serving inside, Ihave seen heavy drinking outside.  Underage drinking is a
problem, and it attracts un necessary police attention.

FYI though, I have never been carded at an event except WICKED in SF.  But that
was pretty lame anyway.  Try your luck.  If there's an event that you really
want to attend, try.  There are always alternatives esp. in the BAy Area
if for some reason the guys working the doors card you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I can agree with this...BUT I just don't see the need for alcohol
at an event...I think if anything we should try and keep it away...
It just ruins the vibe...

Well I think that should do it for this topic...I hope all the promoters 
out there have heard and understand!!!

why 21?  especially if there is no alcohol being served...

i remember the days of pirate radio, when you ONLY KNEW ABOUT THE

this let's leave a stack of flyers at a record store bullshit!!
the party was in an ISOLATED warehouse, not on the corner of down-

of course these parties still got broken up, but MUCH less frequent.

this way, there's no need to push an age restriction on anyone...

Just to give you a little perspective, there's exactly one country
in the world where police aren't normally armed... and the US is
one of the few that police don't often carry automatic weapons.
[Isn't the world so happy and safe?]

Anyone over the age of 21 who has no felony or violent misdemenor
convictions can buy a pistol according to federal law.  About ten
states have significant restrictions above that.  Many now have
a waiting period between buying the gun and being able to take
it home.

I can't speak to other states laws about carrying guns, but
I know California's pretty well.  The general public cannot carry
a loaded gun around in public.  You can sometimes carry an unloaded
gun, but the police don't like it and basically it's not done.
Some security guards can carry weapons; they have to be state
certified before they can.  Some private citizens can get permits
to carry loaded and concealed weapons, but very few people have
them (mostly private investegators, bodyguards, firearms dealers,
etc.  but a few normal people).

In general, anyone with a gun in a club is probably breaking the
law and if they're noticed they're going to be arrested.  There
isn't that much of a problem with weapons in normal clubs; the
problems are mostly out on the street in poorer areas with high
crime and drug rates.  Nightclubs outside those areas (with a few
exceptions) are actually pretty peaceful.

I haven't heard about any problems with armed people at bay
area raves or clubs in the last couple of years.  Usually police
are paying enough attention (because they don't trust ravers ;-)
that people who are armed would get caught.

Ya, about 2 years ago a private security guard, but off duty cop,
shot this guy that in a small (15'x15') bathroom at Berkeley
square, a local club.  He lived but at the time, there was some
question as to whether he was shot in the back or not and it
deffinetly wasn't a justified shooting, but since he was an
off-duty cop they protect there own.  This kind of thing is not
uncommon in the US.

You can buy a gun if your over 21 with no felony record or serious
mental history, although every now and then some nut-case buys a
legal gun and does something attrocious with it everybody goes:
How did that happen?  Most people can not cary a gun in the street
but there are special exceptions for which you can get a permit
for.  This is rare, I have never seen anyone but a cop, or special
security such as armour truck courrier legaly carry a gun.  In fact
even if you were tottaly legal, if you were to carry a non-conceiled
gun and not have a uniform on, you would have the police called and
guns drawn on you every other step so that it would be more dangerous
to you than whatever reason you would be carrying the gun for.  The
black Panthers used to carry weapons legally and I have always
wondered how.  I think the laws just weren't the same back then. 
As far as illegal and conceiled guns go, they are EVERYWHERE and 
you would be surprised to know how many and what kind of different
people carry them.  How do police enforce the law in the U.K., 
without guns?  I have always wondered this.  In the U.S. if a cop
tells me to do something, I generaly do it but if they didn't
have guns, I'd run or fight (depending on the cop) to get out of a
jay-walking ticket.

hi folx!
well, i was in la this past weekend so here's what i can tell you:

-friday night went to something called WHAT ?- got this from the socal-raves
thing . it was in a big warehouse near donwtown la. there were two rooms ,
one ,small, playing hip-hop/funk, the other, bigger, playing fast tekno/indust.
not that many people were dancing and there was a LOT of nitrous - oh, it was
a mere $7 to get in, not too bad. but the thing wa that there was very little
'vibe', and mpst people had their 'love phasers' on 'keep away.' plus there
were a lot of people just watching, especially in the funk room. weird. how
can one NOT dance to funk ? and it was very good, too. slammin'. not so for
the tekno. the dj's did not seem to know the concept of a groove, kept changing
the bpm's, and the song selection was quite bland.

-sunday went to an afternoon 'rave', xcept it was in a club. the musick was
mostly house/disko and no ambient/tekno. it was pretty good and it was FREE.
can't beat that. this was at MAXX's , a club in holywood, cahuenga & yucca.

are people in lalaland into ambient/world muzick at all ?

Subject: Organic/Sound Factory

Went to Organic this Sunday and got to check out the Sound Factory.  Pretty
cool space, really, with many chillout rooms and a full-blown tripout main
dance floor.  They have a whole pile of Intellabeams as well as a multicolor
laser plus the most outrageous discoball cluster above.  All this combined 
with a pretty clean sound system makes for a really psychedelic experience.
The crowd was, well, hmm... shitty for awhile.  Lotsa clubbers (drinkers) and
some strange, unravelike incidents (like break dancing) (?) going on; the 
typical unfriendly atmosphere we all know about.  Fortunately, as you can
predict, the Clubbers took off around 2:30 or 3:00 and then the scene was alot
more chilled out.  Nothing really special as far as The Vibe goes, but at
least quite comfortable.  I had brought some oranges along and handed them out
to people, which worked really well for those who weren't used to that kind
of friendliness.  Everyone should bring something to share - it works really
well.

Ran into Niels early (hey man) and missed Pat, though Mike ran into him and I
was aware that he was there somehwere.  We'll make it next time, Pat.  I 
guess I was just too out of it to concentrate on finding people. :)

All in all, the Sound factory is a good space, but I don't think I'd go to 
any weekly events there.  I think it took a weekend 'rave' event just to thaw
out the attitude there.

Went to Future Forum last night with Brian and Gregg.  Cool thing going on 
there.  Great to help out/chill out with the live DJing there.

No doubt.  I realized just how yummy oranges can be after many hours of
dancing last Saturday.  Then I tried various combos of stuffing my mouth with
Smartees then orange slices.  I felt like a kid.  Seriously though, oranges
are the BEST at a rave for getting your energy back.  Readily peeled slices
are great for making friends too.

Yes!  There's a set of turntables there, i have a decent set of speakers 
there right now, and Brian just replaced the mixer that was being used with 
a much nicer one.  There's also an amp there, but i think that's a very 
temporary loan.  So an amp would be great.  Then we'd have most of the 
components for any sfraves events ready to load up from one nice convenient 
location too.  And of course, as with anything Future Forum uses, whoever 
owns the stuff has priority on its use when they need it.

i keep meaning to post an update on the Future Forum collective, then
falling asleep before i start.  Hopefully tonight i'll get to it.  To
summarize briefly, the rent situation looks a little better, we're looking
for any equipment/furnishings/toys we can get, small events on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and occasionally elsewhen are happening, but for any bigger 
events like a full-fledged fundraiser we're going to need to get permits 
first, which Mark is working on.

Subject: Re:  WATER CONSPIRACY!!!!!!

my sentiments about WATER CONSPIRACY, FRISKING, 18/21+, GUNS AT
RAVES, etc. can be broken down into a theory i have loosely formed.
feel free to elaborate and/or flame, but be gentle.  ;)

raves are known to be large underground dance parties where "techno"
music is played at deafening levels, and drugs of the psychedelick
persuasion are ingested to induce a certain euphoric state of being
so that mental and social barriers are broken down or at least weakened
whilst ravers roll around in the chill spot or revel on the dance 
floor for hours till dawn.

but what actually happenned is that the house movement (which, btw, was
underground when it started) spawned a new type of entertainment/party/
club/experience  ::  the rave.

a rave is usually illegal, or at least pisses off the cops even when 
all legal matters are fulfilled.  the music of choice is "house".  a
very vague description of music, since, as we've all seen, some raves
feature a deep theme, a tribal theme, a hardcore theme, a funky theme,
a trancey theme (my personal rave-fave (tm)), etc.  and i believe that
the idea of 'a rave' will continue to develop into many different 
shapes.  

just because a party is advertized as a rave, doesn't mean it will 
compare to a basics.  or how about the "rages" i posted about about
a month or two ago?  those are actually raves.  

the termn rave has in a way taken on the responsibilities that the word
club did when it first began to be used.  eg  "what type of club is it?"
"oh it's a gay biker club" or "oh it's a deathrock club".  now just
because they are both clubs, doesn't mean that a "clubgoer" is going to
feel at home in both (or either) places!

just the same, a rave is a new venue, be it commercial or be it under-
ground.  and you can't complain about something, when you're part of
the reason it's still around.  i mean if you don't like a rave or club
DON'T GO TO THE NEXT ONE.  don't even stop in to give it a bad review
on sfr.  you're perpetuating it's existence.

KEEP IT UNDERGROUND FOLKS, and you can keep it your way.  it's unfor-
tunate, 'cos the rave revolution DID change the world, but it's NOT
going to change it the way we want it to.  this job must be done in
small groups, One By One.

i'm sorry for soapboxing, perhaps i'm in a pensive mood...or i'm just
tired.

just my opinion...please keep it underground.

Hi There:

One of the things that are making raves as bad as they are today is the cost. 
I have yet to go to a $10 rave where there was no water given out for free. 
all the expensive raves are where they are trying to make a buck at every
chance.  I just refuse to go to raves that are over $10.00 that includes the BS
about getting there before 11:00 that is just a SCAM.  Avoid the Raves at all
cost that are at 16th and Harrison (i.e. Wally World, Sin) Yeah it is 18+ but
the promoters are in it for the money and I have never heard of a good one
being held there.

I beleive by keeping it underground you will also be keeping the price down and
all the stupid rules away.

hmmm... I didn't think "organic" was that unfriendly... of course, i
came expecting very little more than a club atmosphere -- basically my
girlfriend and I had eaten too much delicious food at many good
restaurants over the weekend and we needed to ravercise off all those
xtra calories (that, and the fact that we had pent-up rave-energy cuz
we missed all other raves last weekend).

Given that we had nothing more than ravercise in mind, it was
surprisingly nice: (1) main dancefloor was clean, air was  clean,
didn't wake up with muddy snot in my nose; (2) not too crowded; (3)
soundsystem was very nice -- loud but undistorted; (4) DJing was good
-- mark farina played stuff that i found insteresting, and Jeno was
great.

On the negative tip, there were loads and loads of security orificers
with headsets, one semi-undercover cop on the prowl (she had a badge,
but was wearing street clothes), bottled water $2.00 (no tap water),
etc. 

Given that we basically only spent 4our hours there (11PM-3:30), it was
ok for a "club with rave music"... it was especially nice seeing

Subject: unsubscribe me  :(

Well, I threatened to do this a couple of weeks ago, but for entirely unexpected
reasons I must sadly take my leave from this electronic community that's been
such a central part of my life this past year or so.

A work opportunity has come up which will take me overseas for at least a month,
maybe much longer.  I'll be around a couple of more days, but things will be
way too hectic for me to follow the flow around here anymore.

This is not goodbye, this is au reservoir  ;^)  I'll be back in about a month,
either for a couple of weeks, in which case I'm sure I'll have some sort of
going away party, or for longer in which case I'll have a welcome back party!!!
I'll post details to the list as they arise.

Who knows, I may even arrange to have net.access over there (not too likely
though).

I'm bummed that I'm going to miss the final Come/Unity, ImagINation, and
especially Connection II.  Promise you'll take up the slack for me!

I can honestly say that every one of you whom I've met (over 70 at last count!)
has greatly enriched my life.  The love and spirit in this cranny of the SF
scene has almost been overwhelming at times.

Anyway I hate long goodbyes  ;^)  so be excellent to each other, keep those
love-phasors well-tuned and keep the fire burning brightly in SF so that it
may illuminate and kindle every corner of the planet.

Massive hugs to all,

- MykL G

Just talked with the tour manager and whined about what is progressing out
here.  He stated that they may "cut" this part of the tour anyway.  I'd
imagine they're having problems in Portland and Seattle as well.  Every one of
my possible locations is shot and I can't think of any other options besides
throwing it at the cheesey fairgrounds.  I'd rather just travel to LA and SF
and see it there.

There is this really spectacular old train station that might have been a
possibility, the Utah Arts Council owns it and was fairly hip to the idea.
However, it would be like listening to explosions in a tunnel in there.  Very
lousy accoustics.

I don't know if this has been posted before, so I apologize if I'm reapeating
somebody else. In Issue #3 of RAY GUN, there is an article of the Shamen and
rave music in the US.

I'll just quote the end, since it's the most relevant:

"San Francisco is the one big exception to the rule...There's a lot of people
here who understand. They know what's going on'...[At the concert] There's no
sense of mosh-pit danger or violent frenzy: no jostling to see who can get 
closet to the stage.  Instead people smile and cordially move apart to let me
pass...As geeky as this might sound, there really is some sort of spirit of
camaraderie, as the crowd chants, 'Eezer Goode. E's are good'...At least in
San Francisco, the rave culture -- or whatever you care to call it -- can
indeed go ahead and live"

Make of this what you will.

Now that Mykl is off the list.
I think we should all meet at the airport and send him off in true
rave style.  All it takes is about 10 people , a set of VISION (tm)
tapes and a boom box and the commitment to really make him feel loved.

I've had people come to the airport for me when I was going off into
the great european unknown and I does make one feel good.


Soooo... Who knows/can get his flight info ASAP.
I hear he`s flying out Saturday.

We can all just converge either outside the gate area
or If we're really bold past the gate area but It might be 
hard getting a boom box past the metal detectors.
I think if we have someone carry it who looks like
they are traveling, (and not like a raver) we won't
have anything to worry about, still its a good idea
to leave all contraband at home.

KTVU/Channel 2 Rave Report:"All The Rave"

Quick Summary - Bad information bits were funny. "Cover-your-ass" disclaimers
all over the place. "UNDERGROUND COMPUTER NETWORKS" - plural! Lotsa mugging 
for the camera. What big club has address "3150" ? Promoter of club rave was
Joel. Frisking at door by big bouncers. Big hanging electric sign .

--------------------------------------------------------------
Some Quotes From The Report: [ text in <> are my opinions ]

"Why are these people standing in line at the middle of the night to pay 
$20 apiece? Because they're going to a rave, of course."

"...why don't they just call it a dance party? Well, a rave is a dance party 
that starts after midnight, and goes until dawn, where certain people dress
a certain way, and dance to a certain kind of music, and where some of those
people ingest certain chemical substances."

"..the music.. it's techno pop, otherwise called house music , characterized
by a thumping beat, and machine-made sounds."

"...there's an element of secrecy...people find out where (raves) are from 
word of mouth, or underground computer networks"

< "element of secrecy" ! - for a $20-a-pop club "rave" ???? >

< What are the "underground computer networks" , huh? >

<after talking about the presence of nitrous and extasy at raves, a careful
disclaimer about seeing not anyone taking drugs harder than nitrous, and
the reporter was also careful to point out that they weren't claiming that
anyone they were filming was on anything. Of course, the presence of a TV
camera makes people behave in an altered state almost instantly.>

< does anyone know ravers "Kirby" and "Diane" ? >

Diane, describing one side effect of X: "You don't remember what you just
said, so it doesn't matter what you say"

"We saw no one at this rave who appeared to be sick, and there was no 
violence, or indeed any sort of unpleasantness ."

Subject: Orb Listening Excursion, etc. 


Did anyone go to the Orb listening thing besides me?  Well, I wasn't
impressed by it at all.  I have already seen most of the "U.S. premiere"
Orb film at a party a few weeks ago (Brian's tape, I believe --by the way
Brian, how did you get ahold of it?).  Anyway, the Planetarium is not
really made to show films, and after the film (about 1 hour), everyone
just sat and stared at the fake stars for another hour+ while listening to
the Orb.  Cool, but I can pop in the Orb disc at home, turn off the lights
and stare at the glow in the dark stars on my ceiling for the same effect.
Okay, there were a few interesting visual effects, the occasional meteor,
etc, but for the most part it was pretty boring.  I did get a few free
copies of the "S.F.Orb" cd (3 versions of the Blue Room + Assassin), so it
was worth the trip.
	A few more comments about things...  Is anyone going to TAZ this satu-
rday? The last one was awesome, and only 4 bucks!  I loved the people and the
atmosphere was very warm and intimate.
	Brian!!  When are you going to bring your acid machine over to 
Chateau??  E-mail me and let me know if you've found out your work schedule.
Also, I find it really difficult lately to log into the UCB network.  The

I didn't see it, but I got a play by play from my boss's associate in
Berkeley. She didn't understand much of it, other than if you're a parent,
watch out for your kids. The one they did in Detroit was basically this:
"Your kids are weird and this is why. They're on drugs and they get them
here," which is just more conservative bullshit propaganda to serve the
media-driven sheep of middle America. At least they gave passing mention to
the music, though, and they did take a little pride in Detroit being the
home of techno, plus they mentioned the Chicago house scene.

	Sorry this got out late... but you know, I came to the scary
realization that I've gotten this thing out every week for the past 
50, and almost on time every time too :)

	Some fairly good choices this weekend.  I think Friday night
I'll sleep in for a little bit and wake up around 4am and hit Smiling
Thru, the Hardkisses's thang which starts at 4am.  If your schedule's
not up to that, either of the  other two events Friday sound fine to
me, though a few people had a problem with the space used at the last 
Foundation...

	Saturday night is the duel between Wicked and Groove Kitchen...
They are essentially going to be in the same building, so I predict
that around 4am or so the doors will open connecting the two :)  (this
is pure conjecture, but it _may_ happen).  I would only ditch those
two in favor of "Wild Things" to hear what Juan Atkins sounds like, though
reports are he's more hawdkoah than most San Franciscans are used to.
Whateva.  Next weekend looks to be a madhouse, with something like 9
raves planned....

sorry there...  i got cut off by call waiting  :(

ok-  what kind of idiots would go frolic over a camera??  <trendy clubbers
		who want to be on TV perhaps>

and what about that girl who said the rave was like a "meat market"??
that really explains what sort of rave it is.....  could it be the sound
factory???  did you guys catch a glimpse of that bar??

looks like channel 2 caught a glimpse of a typical 16th and Harrison Rave...

wonder what would happen if they were taping a segment of a FMR??  or do we
	even want that>>>


PRIMETIME................

p.s.  did they even mention the word "vibe", "energy", "community"??
	just checking.. i could be deaf from all that "techno-pop"??

Subject: This Week's RAVE guide


	Sorry this got out late... but you know, I came to the scary
realization that I've gotten this thing out every week for the past 
50, and almost on time every time too :)

	Some fairly good choices this weekend.  I think Friday night
I'll sleep in for a little bit and wake up around 4am and hit Smiling
Thru, the Hardkisses's thang which starts at 4am.  If your schedule's
not up to that, either of the  other two events Friday sound fine to
me, though a few people had a problem with the space used at the last 
Foundation...

	Saturday night is the duel between Wicked and Groove Kitchen...
They are essentially going to be in the same building, so I predict
that around 4am or so the doors will open connecting the two :)  (this
is pure conjecture, but it _may_ happen).  I would only ditch those
two in favor of "Wild Things" to hear what Juan Atkins sounds like, though
reports are he's more hawdkoah than most San Franciscans are used to.
Whateva.  Next weekend looks to be a madhouse, with something like 9
raves planned....

Subject: Re:  All The Rave/Channel 2 Report

Yeah, I thought it was pretty clueless (clueless almost to the point of being
sarcastic, "we cannot confirm that these kids on the screen are in fact on
drugs") and they did focus too much on the drug use (and this is the first time
I've seen nitrous linked so strongly in the media - wonder how long until that's
illegal too!) but it did seem less damning of raves than other newscasts:
"ecstasy is to raves as alcohol is to frat parties" is not too far off the mark,
though the two drugs are vastly different.  

        Oh, and the "information is spread via underground computer networks"
bit means two things:

        1) We're getting our 15 minutes of fame 5 seconds at a time,
    and 2) I can no longer put true undergrounds on the calendar.  No way jose.

        C'est la Vie.

        1)  Just a reminder about the Planet 6 happening Sat. night, at 586
Stevenson, one block south of Market between 5th and 6th.... they are really
cool people and it will likely be very cheap.  Help support the funky
alternatives....

        2)  For those who are interested in saring goodbye to Mykl at the
airport, his plane leaves sometime Saturday or Sunday from SFO (he's not
sure, he's on the waiting list for Saturday).  As soon as I find out exact
details I'll post.  If you're interested in seeing him off send me mail and
I'll keep you posted.  He doesn't know I'm sending this to the list BTW; and
if someone brought a boombox and some tapes that would be... smashing :)

Subject: deep space/blown ears

hey all.  Just got back from Deep SPace.  Got there around 11:30, Spun was on
doing some hip-hop stuff, and quickly gave way to Derek Carter.  This guy
sucks, playing nothing but thump and screaming women.  His set was really
tedious, so I went to hang out in the back room until Jeno was on, and caught
Harry Who doing a nice dancy, mellow set.  Jeno cam einside, so we went out
to suffer with Carter some more, waiting for the music to change.  Jeno came
on, met Pat Dote (hey!) and he started with some cool stuff, but fell into a
'lazy' set that lacked the drive of a full-on, straight up Jeno groove.  Oh
well.

Talked to Kenny of Groove Kitchen, says  that the Wicke-in-front, Kitchen-in-
back ssituation will be really cool.  I think I agree already... :)

Hope to see people there!  Have fun at Foundation, for those of you who go.

Subject: WONDER, Sat Feb 20

Hi all


My friends are having a rave at a club called the OMNI in Berkeley/Oakland.  I
dont know the phone number (left it at home) but I know that it is tommorow and
it is $10.00.  These people are totally cool and they are just trying to break
even.  Hearing how much it cost to rent the space,I will be suprised if they
do.

Anyways I dont know who are going to be the DJs but it is going to be a lot of
new to the scene getting a chance to play.  This is a good chance to support
the scene and listen to some new, Fresh DJ's.

As for myself, I am going snowboarding this weekend in 12" of new powder
YOOOOHOOOOO!

Subject: Orb not coming to Salt Lake City

I can positively say that unless the tour gets delayed another month, the Orb
will not play Salt Lake City.  We found an absolutely beautiful hangar
yesterday, heated, with lots of power and cool owners.  I found out today that
they wanted $4500 for rent for one night.  The most we've ever paid for rent
for one night was $400.  In short, there is no way we can count on another 500
people coming, and I don't have an extra $4500 to cough up to do this.  As for
other locations, we have combed this area and there is virtually nobody who
will do it.

On top of that, this weekend is the deadline I set for finalizing
negotiations.  There just isn't enough time left to advertise, get flyers
printed, and arrange everything else.  The Communion tour failed here because
we arranged it in one week.  If I would have had a month, it would have
probably succeeded.  With a risk like Orb, with a budget twice as big as
Communion, there just isn't anyway I can safely handle it within the given
time.

So I guess I'll see everyone in LA and SF.  If someone could send me ticket
information for both shows, I'd appreciate it.  Next time anyone associated
with the tour phones me, I'll try and squeeze any calendar info out of them
that I can.

hiya all...yes this is about cross posting and not cross dressing...heheheh....
why don't all the list admins do some chatting...so that things will have some
system of crossposting ie postings of news articals, items of interest to all,
national stuff, invitations...cuz then maybe people wont feel compelled to belo
ng to all the lists just to keep up...and maybe things could become a tad more
regionalized...i think this way it would create some diveristy while everyone c
ould keep informed on basic things...just a thought...partyon...susie (:

hey now... i need some help folks...
first of all- the dead are comign to my town the end of march...    
second of all- i want to throw a post dead show rave..
third of all- do you think many deadheads on tour would come?

being a deadhead and raver i would like to expose many more deadheads to
raving.. this would help create new scenes all over the nation due to the
transient nature of most deadheads - scenes that would most likely try (at
least at first) to exist for the vibe and not the dollar... could some
folks give me any tips on this (and organizing a rave in general- this
will be my first attempt..)

thanks for any and all help!

peace out!

As far as I know, there isn't a time when they stop carding, unfortunately.

And sorry for the duplicates of the calendar - my modem hung up just as I

And you got it 4 times, G-man, because I had you on both the calendar-only

it looked to me like they were filming at cesar's latin palace on the mission.
i think the event was that big hoo-ha they had there a while back with all
those special dj's from wherever and live performance by blow and whatnot.

Naturally, they had to have ravers showing off their X, acting all spaced
out, and other stuff to shock your parents. oh well.

what a totally moronic piece of fluff. the only redeeming feature was
the stupid sitcom they had on before the 10:00 news about a compu-nerd
who was going to meet a woman for the first time that he met over a

Niels, get real, they're talking about us.  Lots of ravers know about
sfraves even if they don't know exactly what it is.  Remember, they think
we're the Borg.

Well I think we should ENCRYPT the underground stuff and send it out.

People who want the underground stuff have to get a key from a "trusted"
person.  If you read the PGP manual, there are guidelines for such stuff.
It's what the software was intended for.

"Jet crew sues over drug sting"

Miami (AP) --- A cargo jet crew caught in a botched cocaine sting
are suing the US government, saying they were subjected to 12 days
of torture in a Honduran prison because of bungling by drug agents.
Three crew members of the Belize Air International jet say they
were beaten with rubber hoses and shocked with cattle prods after
Honduran authorities found 48kg of cocaine on board their plane.

US drug agents hid the cocaine on the plane in Belize without telling
the crew, say the lawsuits.  The United States has apologised to
Honduras for carrying out the operation without telling the government.
The lawyers say the US was trying to catch drug smugglers who were
trying to force Belize Air to ferry cocaine to Miami.

----------

My question is, does this make sense?  If they were trying to catch
people in Belize who wanted to ship drugs, why would *the US* supply
the drugs to be shipped?  Something just doesn't fit.  Sounds much
more like the usual illicit US govt drug smuggling to me, with a
hastily-added coverup after the drugs were found by the Honduras
authorities.

I think I know somewhat enough about the nature of the beast.

I think we don't need "military grade" encryption here,
cyphertext will do nicely.  There are versions of PGP for 
UNIX, DOS and the Mac.
With this type of scheme, the BadGuys (tm) can easily break it, but it will
take some effort.  It won't hold up against a pro but will keep 
"curious eyes" from reading stuff that doesn't concern them, like
locations of undergrounds.  The "keys are easy to circulate, 
by word of mouth and the key can change frequently, with each message.

I am going to speak out against encryption.  While lots of people here are 
knowlegable enough about their UNIX to be able to do such a thing, lots more
I would imagine aren't.  I get mail once or twice a week from people asking
how to do FTP; couple that with trying to implement a piece of software across
thirty thousand different platforms and OS's and you're asking for trouble...
the best thing to do would be to gather together the names of people YOU want
to know about any underground info you may have, and assemble them into a
personal alias.  This is very easy to do under UNIX, and I can't imagine it
not being available for VMS machines.  Sending encrypted messages across
sfraves seems like a huge waste of resources to me.  Sorry.

Subject: Encryption

personally i think a LOT more stuff  needs to be done encrypted
if nothing for the sake of just doing ti so the rest of
the stuff that needs to be encrypted doesnt look obvious

BUT, i think e-mailing people directly is the best answer
plus phone trees and any other stuff that 
seems to work
big thing is not to mail to anyone who you havent met
if someone you met is a narc
you arent going to catch them anyway cuz they already fooled you

BUT... PGP is pretty simple and VERY user friendly
almost to an annoying point,
but nonetheless its not that complicated to setup
and if you do want encryption capability
you can ask me, but im sure there are many more people
who know what their doing since i just started using it
30 min ago
(really.. very easy stuff)

ANOTHER thing i would like to say though
is that the only reason Computers were talked about in association
with raves is because it was in TIME
and the only reason it was in TIME was probably because it
was in Mondo's New User Guide
which of course was because of sfraves...
so i wouldnt worry too much
about censoring stuff other than club #'s and locations

My $0.02 worth re: encryption -

 What is the Problem? -> Bad Guys (BG) are reading sfraves to find out where

 How do the BG get access to sfraves? -> The BG are either full-up or
	calender-only sfravers.

 How will SFRavers read the encrypted stuff -> By knowing ahead of time
	how to decode it. Therefore, the BG will also know, because they
	are posing as SFRavers.


	Same reasoning goes for phone trees.


 What's the Solution? -> Dang if I know. Maybe - hope that the raves have
	such good vibes and are discreet enough to not disturb the neighbors,
	that the BG ( who can't all be B ) have no good reason to bust the
	"dance party". 

	Of course, if the BG are really B, they'll bust for fake reasons ...

	Is encryption & secrecy to be a tenant of rave culture, or does it
go against the grain of the *ideals* of such a hopeful future.  remember,
live by the gun, die by the gun.  keep secrets, you anger those left out.
if your society (or dance) can't function in an open way, maybe you have to
change what your dance has become.
	cops are looking to make drug arrests as agents of the state.  they
make big money off alcohol, narcotics & tobacco--but they don't want you to
experience transcendental states of consciousness.  it has been like this
throughout history, and i mean for several thousand years.  (remember 
socrates forced to drink hemlock?)
	they are very sophisticated.  if they have reason to suspect you are
hiding something they want, they will be able to trace you no matter your
encryption methods.  if you are just small potatoes, what have you got to
encrypt?  
	Many small, organic tribal dance circles are unbustable on sheer
volume alone, but if you're set on having a minimum of several hundred of

would be refreshing to see someone other than my conservative co-workers

Does everyone have this problem Monday morning when you have to pack your

susupect that many of you do since you have Internet access and that 
usually means a pretty corporate job or school working towards getting a

Subject: 2 encrypt or not 2 encrypt


1) Just using private email does not guarantee any secrecy at all.  It is 
   very easy to look at any mail going through a particular site.  If
   secrecy is desired, this is not a solution.
2) A chain is only as good as its weakest link.  It only takes _one_
   informer in the chain to break it.  This makes things difficult.
   You'd be surprised at how far into a 'scene' an infiltrator can
   get if their bosses feel it necessary.  The best hope for secrecy is
   simply not to bring yourselves to their attention.
3) So how do you get a bunch of people together without calling attention
   to yourself?  I don't know.  It seems to me that you can either be
   real small and quiet, or move real fast.  Raves seem to fit the second
   category rather than the first.
4) Keyed encryption is one way to 'move real fast'.  Word of mouth to
   trusted people is the secure way, but it's slow and physically limited.
   The Net is a shortcut to this.  The problem I see is, if we have to
   disseminate keys in a trusted manner, why can't we just say where and
   when the gathering is along with it and bag this technophile crud?
   Because getting the information at the last minute means the time 
   available for the wrong people to crack the info is real short, and
   much can happen before they are able to react.
5) Why am I using numbered headings?  They're silly.
6) I think encryption is worth a try.  You never know.  Spread the key by
   word of mouth (phone isn't real secure), or even mail.  Properly 
   sealed mail is difficult to tamper with invisibly unless the Big Boys
   want to get in, and then you're hosed anyway.  Make sure to use a security
   envelope, or enclose the thing so you can't read it from the outside.
   Then, on day of event, shoot out the info.  Also shoot out various 
   encrypted junk at likely times as a decoy.
7) I don't like the secrecy stuff, and it may turn out not to work, but
   a TAZ that gets busted after an hour accomplishes nothing besides 
   wasting a lot of fossil fuels for the people that drove there.

very good points....

My major complaint is that if there's a set number of people you want to
read your posts anyways, why not mail them directly rather than through
sfraves?  Sending encrypted mail over such a public list makes those
who either don't want to use encryption or can't, or who don't get "THE
KEY", feel completely left out.  There's NO reason not to use aliases;
they are easy to set up on just about every machine, much easier than
encryption.  If you're hyper-paranoid you can use encryption then, too;
but I'm getting closer to considering the policy of REMOVING people from
the list who post encrypted messages. 

Let's try and work towards building community rather than devising ways
to separate ourselves.  I do think that posting semi-quasi-legal raves
to the list is okay, because if any officer of the law is watching us
THAT closely maybe by now they've gotten the hint :)  I just won't put
it in the calendar.

although i feel that being open is the very key of the scene
secrecy is what keeps it alive
maybe we need ot think of a way to stop
being secretive and just be open about everything
but personally i think that means that a bunch of people
will just go to jail

i mean, teh whole culture is centered aroudn the secrecy
of where things are going to be 
so an encyrpted mailing list is not much different
and hell, its a lot more secure

the answer i see (but why do i count i live in socal?)

is dont worry about encryption or anything like that
unless you really feel taht your accounts and mail arent secure
(and they arent, but this is assuming that anyone is going to bother)
(the real problem is stuff getting posted and getting read 
by some personage who is against raves)

just set up a list of people who you MEET physically
and dont seem like narcs and just have one or two or however many poeple
mail stuff out
not a real mailing list,
but if everyone on the list has a list of everyone else
then anyone can send a message
this means that EVERYONE on the list is trustworthy
which is why you meet them physically
and dont decide that they are trustworthy
while under the influence of chemical substances

iff things do get really serious, though
PGP is teh definite way to go

are keeping tabs on it - probably even police.  You know they monitor the
net.  This is a _public_ forum.  99% of the parties listed in the calendar
are advertised on flyers, and if you don't think the cops pick up flyers,
well my dear, let me tell you something.  What it is is up to us and if we
keep it as positive as possible, the cops will have no gripe with us.  Most
ravers don't drink, and there are never fights.  Any time the news reports
fights at a rave, the _police_ are invariably quoted as saying that it was
gang members or not ravers anyway.  I even remember a cop saying something
wasn't a real rave because of what happened. In the paper!

Humm. Seems we've had quite a struggle with keeping things private, (and out 
of the hands of folks who would do the wrong thing with the information), vs.
what for me is one of the main reasons for this list, which is the free 
exchange of where and when things are happening. As far as I'm concerned Brian 
dropped quite a bombshell when he said he didn't want to post underground rave 
info here. When it was debated if we should open the list up to SF Net, I was 
opposed because I figured info showing up on a public terminal on the Haight, 
was much more likely to find it's way to the wrong folks, (police), and a long 
debate ensued with people being accused of elitism, etc, encryption was 
proposed and here we are again with the thing. If Brian is serious, then 
instead of attempting to limit who sees the info, the info is going to be 
limited. I'm not to fond of the latter.

I'm not really much into paranoia, and don't think SFPD would know what to do 
with an i-node to save their lives. I don't think they secretly monitor our 
mail. I think the probability of raves posted here getting into the wrong 
hands in a timely manner is much much smaller than from a flyer left on the 
bar at the Housing Project.
If you really think so, end this list and start over with people you know and 
go from there.

Subject: NY Times Moby Review/File under Rock



New York Times Feburary 20, 1993
Hyperactive Band of One For Techno 
by Jon Pareles 

	If techno music is going to make the leap from dance clubs to the pop charts, 
its starkly propulsive dance rhythms are going to need melodies, identifiable stars or
both. Moby, a one-man band from New York City, could be the techno performer whose
showmanship carries him to a wider audience without turning techno tracks into pop
songs.
	He performed last Saturday night at a rave concert at the Academy that had 
the requisite eye-popping lights, recorded dance music and an audience dressed in
bright, loose clothes. MobyUs techno has bits of rap in it, but, it depends on dissonant
electronic syncopations and booming drumbeats and basslines.
	On stage, Moby himself was nearly as hyperactive as the dancers on the floor. 
He delivered the occasional lyric: a shouted "Go!" or, in "Electricity," a rap that
praises largely wordless techno music for providing "no questions, no answers." He
jumped around the stage, poked at two keyboard setups, leapt up on a table and held out
his arms in a crucifixion pose. Between songs, he named song titles and did unusual
things for a techno performer. He told listeners they could have a good time without
drugs and dedicated a song to Jesus Christ. But with strobe lights flickering and
spotlights sweeping as the music pumped with clout and clarity, he was at once master
and servant of an unstoppable electronic engine.
	The Prodigy, from England, showed how techno is already splintering. As 
Americans 
borrow from hip-hop, British techno looks to Jamaican dance-hall rapping, Liam
Howlett, the Prodigy's keyboardist and composer, works with a dance hall-style rapper,
Keity, and two male dancers. The music is more changeable than its American cousin,
shifting texture every 30 seconds. But on stage, the Britons talk too much. Instead of
letting dancers appreciate the Prodigy's cleverness with melodic hooks and speed shifts
that felt like a zipper opening up the rib cage, Keity kept up exhortation -"Wind it
up"-that sounded like badgering.
	Cybersonik, a pair of keyboardists  from Detroit, was less polished, using flat
video-game sounds and cold often unsyncopated drum-machine rhythms. As momentum
gathered, it became clear that the music was deliberately primitivist, stripping away
fancy rhythms and elaborate sound-shaping to get to a raw, punky version of techno.

Brian,
	Think about what you are saying. Why don't we broadcast
the FMR on KZSU? Is it because we aren't being "open" or is it that
we don't want everyone + tha police their.  What is the big deal with
encryption.  I assure you that within the next 3 years MOST of the
e-mail that YOU will send will be encrypted, not to hide from the
authorities but to have some privacy.  Did you hand out fliers to Alternity
at Sharons and Juice?  Why not?  Were you being exclusive or were you
protecting something that was important to you?

Brian,
	I just had an interaction with some asshole with a .mil attached
to his login over a person's right to post some information that was
in no way illegal (it was informative if not controversial)
It was about a new strain of computer virus,  the poster did not advocate
the use of the virus or tell anyone where to obtain it, he just informed
the group of they "anatomy" of such beast.  We'll this guy jumps all over
the list manager of this group and even calls him on the phone to harass
him.  After I sent him a formal but friendly letter voicing my disapproval
of his methods, he sends a reply accusing the list master of breaking
federal law because he reposted the harrassing letter to the list, and 
cc's me. Implying that I better keep my mouth shut as well.
I posted his threat allong with my reply to the list.  Now I didn't do anything
wrong and I'm just about as open as they come, Brian but I warn you,
there are people out there who are zealous selfrightous assholes and we need
to protect ourselves from them or some of us could end up in very bad 
circumstances over some bullshit.  I hope you don't have to stup to
deleting people from the list who post encrypted messages cuz I've got
PGP installed and I WILL be using it (Not necessarrily on the list).
The fucked up thing is that I was sorta luke warm on the whol encryption thing
until I had my run-in with Mr. High-and-Mighty-Army-Man.  You have to realize
that there are people who are CONTROL freaks who will violate you civil
liberties just to be right and to save face, THEY WOULD RATHER SEE YOU GO TO
JAIL FOR SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO THAN TO ADMIT THAT THEY MIGHT BE WRONG
ABOUT YOU OR THE SCENE.
Brian, You know I love people, I want to build community as much as anybody.
But I was alive during the 60's. I saw what CONINTELPRO and other such
"law enforcement" agencies did to groups that scared them.  I will send them
love but I won't incriminate myself infront of them.

There is an old islamic motto that says Have Faith in Allah but tie up
your Camel.

In my opinion the sfraves list has been compromised and NO-ONE should post
anything on it that they would not like to be confronted with in a court
of law.  I'm sorry but that's the way I feel.  If you want to discuss this
with me in detail or ask me more about related incidents well...

What I said more precisely was that I wasn't going to put semi-quasi-legal
raves on the rave calendar, but I would not be against having them posted on
the regular full list.  The cops _may_ have time to put someone on the calendar
list and get a print out once a week, but I do have a problem believing that 
someone would sift through our discussions about shoes and stuff to find the
occasional post about a warehouse party.  It's just not worth their time. 

So, to recap: I am _not_ against posting underground rave info here.  

>proposed and here we are again with the thing. If Brian is serious, then 
>instead of attempting to limit who sees the info, the info is going to be 
>limited. I'm not to fond of the latter.

Yes, the issue has been passed around before, but bringing it up every now
and then is certainly warranted.  I am not going to do either of what was
suggested above.  I simply don't have time (though the heavy discussions 
about drugs a few weeks ago prompted one person involved with the machines
which do the distribution for the mailing list to ask me to consider doing
it, he didn't want the machines confiscated by the DEA).  

The only restriction I've ever made was about Full Moon Rave info.  The
phone/e-mail tree worked pretty well; and this I did mainly because I was
specifically asked NOT to put it on the list.  I'm not sure if not putting
it on the main list had any effect this month, mainly because Charter Oak
is on the police watch list anyways; but if it's held somewhere remote 
next month, and the cops find out about it despite not being mentioned on
the list, I'll seriously consider whether not putting it on has any real 
effect.

Me neither.

I wouldn't say "much much" smaller, I'd say about equal (at least if you
consider just the postings to the calendar, which gets sent to a total of
450 people in net-land).

>If you really think so, end this list and start over with people you know and 
>go from there.  

I don't think anything that drastic is necessary; I still have a basic faith
in the theory that anyone who has time to read the list is NOT someone we'd
have to worry about picking up a phone and dialing the cops.  And if they are,
so what?  If the promoters of a particular event are gonna have something in
a quasi-legal location, if they're smart they should realize that cops will
show up SOMETIME, and be ready for them.  The only time it's in the wrong 
hands is when the cops try and defuse the action before it starts (as 
happened at the December FMR).  *sigh*...

Like I said, this line of reasoning _could_ lead to your relatives

Ahh, but the error in this assumption makes shakey ground for the rest:
_YOU_ know this all is small potatoes, _I_ know this is all small potatoes,
but "THEY" evidently think it is a matter of civic/national importance
to prevent the raves from going on.  What can ya do?

Gotta go.  I see someone with binoculars across the street.

Subject: List Security

Since everyone is posting 'two points' or so, here's mine.

First I'd like to point out that with the exception of FMR's very
nearly all the events on the list can be found out about via other
means.  (Info lines etc...).   And not posting FMR's makes sense
because relatively few (<20) people know the actual location until
just before the rave.  Due to his efforts in the past, Brian is one of
those people, and it's not right to expect him to post trusted info
like that.

Therefore, removing events from the list or encrypting them probably
wouldn't be very effective in the long run. 

Secondly, while public key encryption is certainly a great tool, it
does have it's limitations.  I admit I haven't taken much time to study
the technique, but wouldn't brian effectively have to separately
encrypt messages for everyones public keys?  If not, why couldn't I
decode the message from anyone's public key?  And if so, that's nearly
250 separate encryptions of each message (although I understand
encryption/decryption to be fairly simple using PGP... all the
overhead is in generating the keys.)

Subject: my this is getting stupid, but...

i like bieng stupid so hey
why not?

i kinda like the bulleting thingy 'cept i like eltters

A- _BRIAN_ would not have to do ANYTHING, i really hope no one
expects brian to do anything else, if you want to use encryption
or your own 'underground' mailing list, 
i believe it should be a self-project

B- The 'secure' way of sending encrypted messages
is to have it encrypted especially for one person
the 'not-so-secure' way of encrypting messages is to make one message
adn then spread the password out verbally

C-i REALLY think that we need to realize the difference between
security and being elite
when people complained about the SF Net connection it was because
'all those geeks who spend their friday nites logged in trying to get
dates might start showing up'
THAT was called elite
saying 'we got to be a little more careful cuz the cops are possibly
paying attention' is NOT

D-Openness and Underground are somewhat against each other
but its something that has to happen because the Man
dont like people be open and if the Man knows people are bieng open
hes gonna shut 'em down

E-Although i think things have gone a little crazy with the encryption stuff
i think it did bring up teh good point of being open vs beign careful

F-encryption should stay off the list, unless there is something up
well at least for now... hopefully sometime soon the whole list will
be encrrypted,  the point of encrypting everything is cuz that way
encrypted stuff dont look so obvious

G-RE: cops reading the list...
KCSB Santa Barbaras radio station along wiht every other UC radio station
was almost shut down becuase One man sat listening to his radio for months
until he finally started understanding punk lyrics
and then he sat and listened until he heard some he didnt like
there are really psycho people out there, and a few of em ARENT
on our side and they DONT have anything better to do than
sit around reading mail trying to find bad things in it

H- there is no Rule letter H

I-i could go on, but as i started off with, this whole thing
is getting a bit ridiculous

two points?

...and has room for all our different approaches to the problem.  If some 
of us want to be ultra-secure and only leak locations to people with which
we have shared bodily fluids, that's fine -- but we risk not having a very
big event.  If we decide to post here, that's one less degree of security,
but lots more good people will probably show.  If you want to leave stacks
of flyers in Daleeps, well that's another thing entirely.

Do what you think is the Right Thing, and if it doesn't turn out to be, try 
something else.  Remember that the point is to have fun, and getting too
caught up in publicity or secrecy practically guarantees you're not going to
have fun anymore.

The point is just to DO IT.  Our culture is so attuned to consumption that
we forget how much fun it is to roll our own joy instead of buying it at
Tower Records or Waldenbooks.  An ounce of action is worth well over a
pound of talk at today
's exchange rates.

Subject: Paranoia


...will destroy ya, as the Kinks song goes.  (This in response to nineball's
comments).  But where does caution become paranoia?  There's no clear
dividing line.  I simply don't give out incriminating information about 
myself to anyone who I haven't known and trusted for a long time, besides 
...some things. <hee, hee>  This doesn't strain my brain much and doesn't
keep me from having a fulfilling life, since bragging about stuff you did
implies that you need approval for the actions; not a healthy behavior
anyway.  Not like it isn't fun to trade stories about What We Did By The
Pier Early One Summer Morning, but do I really need to tell 250+ people on 
the list?  No.  

If the government cracked down more, I'd get more secretive.  If it got more
tolerant of certain behaviors, I'd open up more.  It's all relative to how
hard I feel like working (which isn't much, generally).  Your mileage may
vary.  Offer not valid in Wisconsin.  Not responsible for injury or

Subject: wild things and wonder..


just a short rambeling about wonder and where the wild things are..

wonder was rather small, and the space was kinda large.. it did start to
pick up at the end, but then it closed at 2..  
it seemed that for a number of people there it was their first rave.

where the wild things are was CROWDED.  and it was the kinda of guys without
shirts and girls wearing basically underwear and hanging all over the guys
without shirts type crowd, in part at least!

the music seemed to be going well, tho i was only there for an hour or so, and
wasnt up to dealing with the oh so crowded and hot dance floor..

UNFORTUNATLY, at both funky teckno tribe and at wild things, we had shirts
stolen from the joURnees booth.  that upsets me greatly..
we didnt use to have problems with theft..  if anything we have been more
observent about the stuff..  but i guess we will need to secure the shirts
to the table in some fashion..
but its really a shame that it happens  :(

and now i think its time for me to get some sleep finally :)

Subject: No Place Like Home

Due to the modern miracle of Time Compression (tm) my entire overseas
adventure was packed into an infinitessimally vanishing period of time
(in the limit as t -> 0).  Ultraviolet Catastrophe refer to this process as
"Alchemizing" after the well-known sample editor; although usually applying
to sound samples, in this case we see an return to the original sense of
the term -- turning light and air into Gold.

As fate would have it, the very night of this metaphysical transformation
SF would throw down three of the best parties it's ever experienced:  TAZ,
Groove Kitchen, and Wicked were all world-class (was Garth *ever* more god-
like than last night???)  The TAZ folk show real promise for being the Future
of the Vibe.

This all could all be interpreted as being a master conspiracy to force me
to realize how foolish I was to attempt to leave (if I wanted to indulge in
idle paranoid solipsism!  ;^)

Thanks for the outpouring of love and support from just *everyone*!!!  Sorry
to have inadvertantly messed with your brains -- just imagine what *I* feel

Subject: encrypt?  why?

People:

Let's face it... this entire discussion about encryption is
pointless (but it does make good reading).  I know
encryption is supposed to be a good way to protect
information from being read by the "wrong" people, but all
those programs that are out there that are considered
"good" for encryption are good because they meet certain
standards.  If we ask ourselves who sets the standards, the
answer is someone that is working for the government.  The
fed sets standards for everything - and I assure (and hope)
that they are not so stupid that they will set standards so
high that it is beyond their own technology to decrypt the
messages in question.  They have the resources, time, and
LEGAL authority to read anything they want to.
Encryption of these messages will (IMHO) serve 2 purposes.
1)  It'll make things a LITTLE more difficult for the "wrong"
people to read but it will also 2) alienate those that it is
allegedly protecting.  If someone on the list fails to get the
password or  whatever the key is to decrypt - you are
denying someone access to the information that they are
entitled to - point?

Also - I think encryption will only attract unnecessary
attention.  Let's face it, it is human nature to really want to
read the message that says "Top Secret" or "For your Eyes
Only" or "Do Not Read This."  C'mon, by encrypting stuff,
you are only telling someone else that it is really really
secret, and should not fall into the wrong hands.
Gimmieabreak - we're not discussing things that affect
national security - just raves.

If there are people out there, that are worried, for one
reason or another, of getting in trouble for mentioning the
use of controlled substances, then they post at their own
risk.  As far as the information about upcoming events - I
think SFPD has enough resources to find out about them
without the use of e-mail.  I haven't seen many events
posted on the calendar that I hadn't heard about already,
and I'm in fucking Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.  If you really
want to be careful about it - post it on the morning of the
event.  Hopefully, the cops will have already committed
resources to other events learned about earlier, and will not
have time make arrangements to bust another.

I also have to agree with Larry Ching in his message to the
"LURKING" cops out there.  We really have nothing to hide.
We should invite them to disuss things with us.  I think this
whole police things is rediculous.  Who at a rave whould
ever even think of getting violent?  I figure that if I wanted
to get shot, stabbed, beaten up - I'd go to the bar around the
corner, or a Giants Game - the chances there are higher than
at a proper rave.

Ths entire cop thing is really out of hand.  I hate seeing or
hearing of them busting an event when really isn't a good
reason.  Drugs?  Not.  Drugs are everywhere.  Most of the
hype is due to media coverage.  I seriously think we should
write letters to Channel 2, or Hard Copy or whatever that
show was, and send them a weeks worth of mail from SFR
to show them that we are all intelligent people and not just
hyperactive-flunkies looking to get high and have a good
time.  We should not be spiteful or express anger, we
should just tell them about reality - something the media
has trouble dealing with.

I am not sure, but I think I am missing out on something...

if we all do the encryption stuff, than this thing gets ruined.  I mean,
I don't have the ability to decode the stuff, and if it getting to that
point where we are coding are messages, then something is goign wrong..IMHO...

all I know is that IF the cops/police/law humans are on the list, than
that's that.  so what?  really?  I mean, so there's talk of raves..well,
they all know about them anyway, they go to the big ones, they bust some
little ones, and that's it.  I mean, this is the San Francisco Bay Area, folks.
Underground/alternative shit is the way of life here...the raves are too big,
we all know that.  I feel that I will probably never get to rave as I did
in the past, with out people asking me about stuff during the day, reading
rave evetns in my school paper's calendar, I mean, it's just outta control.

so what?  I mean, we are just going to have to live with the attention and
dance.  and dance.  and love.  I mean, if there is someone really reading
this stuff, s/he  knows us and knows that we aren't bad people.  we don't condone drug use or violence, we recognize certain aspects of the rave scene
that society thinks as negative, but we stress teh community.  we are
a family, and that's that.

I don't know, but I really think that encrypting stuff is bad news.
send private email.  phone the person.  I like the phone tree for FMR.  that
works...


but when I see a paragraph that looks like a file transfer gone bad, I 
get sad.

anyway, the show was awesome, and I cannot WAIT to see everyone this coming
weekend.  I couldn't make it to Wictchen but I am sure it was fun...I
danced for you guys anyway...

live and enjoy it....

Subject: want wicked@townshend info on DJ timeslots


Ok, enuf encryptomania. Howzabout some info. I was too busy
dancin&tweekin @ Wicked to find out who was DJing and when. (it didn't
help that the DJ booth was impossible to see due to being enshrouded in a
starspangled fritillary of sensory enhancement and temporal obfuscation.)

So... Can someone who was there and knowledgeable (and capable of seeing
through aforementioned starspangled fritillary) tell me which DJ's were
playing and when? Tnx

I personally had a good time with the following rigorous rave
programme: Wicked 1-7, Donut & Hot-Chocolate Breakfast 7-7:30, End-Up
7:30-8:30, DNA Afterlife 9:00-11...

I thought Wicked was fun, though it was overcrowded and slightly
attitudinal. I ended up seeing one scuffle break out.... Solved the
crowd/scuffle problem by finding an out-of-the-way area for dancing --
behind the right speaker stack to the right of the stage.

The sound was excellent! Clear, loud, and undistorted. I didn't have to
wear earplugs, and my ears were not ringing afterwards. (a good thing).
I danced for a long long time, so I guess the music was good. Unlike a
previous poster who said "A VIBELESS WICKED", I thought it did have
vibe, but then again, my L-phaser was set to "wow!".

I chose Wicked over TAZ because I wanted to hear the Townsend
soundsystem...

I'd like to hear reports of TAZ and Groove Kitchen (quality, DJs, vibe,
etc.). For some reason, I never felt compelled to check out Groove
Kitchen even though the door separating the two parties was supposedly
open.

PS: Wicked was a veritable SF-raves get together. Everybody was there. Hi!

well, the layout was pretty cool, with the lights and the new balcony.
and the music sound system was xcellent! the music selection was mixed
imo. there were times when the dj around 3:50 or so was playing disko -
really! i did not get into it that much, not funky enuff for me. but just
after 4 the muzik got really good. as for the vibe, it was pretty small.
i introduced myself to about 10 people and only 2 talked with me for more than
a few seconds. there seem to be many people in tight , uncomfortable clothes.
so i had a pretty good time , but left around 5:30 due to lack of stimulation.
take care/shalom/rave on/keep the vibe strong

Translation:

Wicked was pretty cool.  I got there at 11:30 and saw this huge
line, I was going to go to Grooove Kitschen, mostly to hear 
different DJs (I hear Jeno and Garth all the time), but I ran
into Zak standing out front, chatted a little, and started going
around to the back when I ran into a couple of other people I 
knew in line, so I stopped to talk to them, then Pete R and Jesse
walked by.  So I talked to them while they wait in line, but I
was still intending to go to Groove Kitchen, so I hung out till
they made it to the front, then I walk back past the line and
find another couple of people I know, so I'm finally convinced
that Wicked was the place to be.  Soon we have a little SFR
reunion in line as more SFRavers show up.

Thomas and Markie Mark started it off; they were playing some
interesting stuff, but the groove wasn't right, or there were
too many people walking around the (already-crowded) dance floor 
to get lost in the musick.  But Jeno and Garth's sets there
were most excellent.  At around 6, the doors were opened between
Groove Kitchen and Wicked; Spun was still spunning back there.
I didn't stay long; by then, natural diffusion had taken place
so it was hard to tell what it had been like before the doors
had opened.  At that point, both were still full, although not
as crowded as before.  

I think my favorite thing about Townsend/King St is the donut
shop around the corner, since I usually get hungry long before I
get tired...

There seem to be a plethora of events coming up, I have a ton
of flyers that Mr.Behlendorf will know what to do with...
The only one that's happening before the next calendar:

  atomic rooster presents: Shrove Tuesday
	Grateful Dead Mardi Gras Celebration
	Carlos-James-Gavin-Planet 6
	Oakland Coliseum, North Lot (66th St)
	Tuesday, 23 February, 6pm-??

i punted again on friday night, preferring to sleep off the strenuous
work week (all you who know me and my attitude towards hard work are
choking on your dr peppers, undoubtedly).  awoke at 4 am to go to
smiling thru yet again.  i got there, asked where i could find my
housemate, and was pointed towards the dj booth in the outer room!  so
i went up there and kicked him out and spun some records for a bit.
great fun, although the monitoring wasn't worth shit and i didn't
actually *know* what any of the records i was playing sounded like...
made for some very... *special* mixes.

didn't really pay a lot of attention to the crowd or the music,
actually.  met some guys from the group "Original Rockers" (they have
a track on ambient dub: volume 1).  hung out with friends.  etc.

so, we bopped out of there to eat breakfast and go synth shopping.
unfortunately, the store didn't open til 12 so we went back to the
club and hung out til it ended at noon.  then i went and bought some
great old gear including a moog prodigy so i can be just like the
prodigy.  (yeah right)

saturday night - everyone was going to wicked, but i just wasn't
feeling at all social so i stayed home and slept.

sunday - went to hear a friend spin at Atlantis in the evening.  first
time i'd ever been to that space.  pretty weird little club, with an
exorbitant cover charge for such a space ($7).  not a bad sound
system.  the few people who were there seemed pretty relaxed, although
most of them were in the bar area drinking rather than in the dance
area dancing.  i can't say i'd recommend it unless you are desperate
for something to do on a sunday night and have $7 burning a hole in
your pocket.

Subject: Wicked Kitchen

Well, my feelings are mixed to the event.  I arrived early, due to
taking the train up..... Very large line, plethera of clubbers/very few
ravers.  I kind of expected this.  My original plan was to just to hang
out and let my cold medicine do a little work- and let the bar close.
Went upstairs to check out the little loft/chill area.... Too many
people who looked like they were on something for the first time, and in
need of water, etc.  Spent about an hour up there talking to people, and
all I think of was- Why am I not dancing to this DJ?  If it was Thomas
who started things out- Cheers to him!  Not many poeple on the dance
floor, but the music was just DEEEEEEEEP.  I definately have to check
him out again, I recommend it!  1:30am:  Too many poeple running around
the dancefloor and not enough dancing, so time to sit down......
Unfortunately, the next 2 hours were the most uninspiring (sp?) garbage
I have heard in a long time IMHO (Markie Mark?) Dull, basic, canned,
pre-packaged, etc.  Jeno came on- started slow, kicked in, and created
some serious momentum in the crowd... (could it be that all the drinkers
went home? Naaaaaah)  This left the opening for Garth, he picked up
where Jeno left off and took me into another dimension.  Cheers again
for those two.  Upon leaving Wicked I was left with just a couple
impressions:  The bar should close sooner.  All people of all ages
should be let in when the bar closes (for legal reasons).  Townsends
sound system is the clearest and most bone-shaking system I have heard
in a long time.....  And last of all-------  I need a new hat.  The one
I wear seems to have Drugs for sale on it and I don't even know about it.

Subject: tweekend report


I paid a visit to Smiling Through at around 6:30am.  The music seemed
better and louder this time around, but like last week, there weren't
enough people for the dance floor to attain critical mass. I only
stayed for 1.5 hours, so maybe it filled up later.  This is a really 
nice place to hang out for $5 and I recommend that everyone go and
help it take off.

Janie & I got to TAZ around 12:30.  It was a medium energy scene, warm
and friendly. 2 rooms of music, one seemed to be hiphopish with an
open mike at times, but was generally low key with blacklights and
cushions.  The other larger room had the main sound system.  I 
thought that the nameless DJ's, though unpolished, did a fine job with 
the song selections.  The sound system was kinda rough, but adequate.
There was also a chillout room with some nice visual projections.  We
hung out with a lot of sfravers there (HI!), and held an impromptu 
welcome home party for MykL.  After a few hours, I started to hear 
Townsend's woofers calling to me so I dragged Janie away to check out 
Wicked.

The 3:30 vibe at Wicked was a stark contrast to TAZ, crowded, clubby,
unsettled, and a little on the meaty side.  We hung out for about an
hour after which Janie decided she couldn't get into it, so I took her
home.  Guess we should have stayed at TAZ a bit longer.

I got back to Wicked, and things started to get better after 5 or so.
Jeno and Garth were great, and I had psychologically prepared myself
for "We Are Family" so was able to ride it out OK.  Except for some
occasional popping, the sound was pretty amazing.  The lighting was
disappointing though, just your basic strobes and stuff, no lazers, 
intellibeams or projections that I can remember.  They also had this 
camouflage netting hanging around that seemed rather pointless.

The hallway to Groove Kitchen opened up, and provided a pleasant change
of atmosphere, allowing me to enjoy a nice chunk of Spun there.  While 
in GK, Terry, one of the GK promoters, enthused on how great it was when
different promoters could cooperate on a gig like this.  He said that
there had been some fear the the GK crowd would empty in favor of 
Wicked and he was real happy to see GK hold its own.

Wicked was still going strong when I left at about 7:45 for to the 
AfterLife, which, starting next week, is being moved to....TEN FIFTEEN 
FOLSOM!!! This could be an exciting development.  Anyway, the crowd
was even less ravey than usual, the sound system died a few times, 
records kept skipping...but Phil from Australia was excellent, and 
overall I had I good time there.  Garth treated me to another 
rendition of "We Are Family", and later degenerated into
discoland but I managed to keep my raver happy-joy-love sense intact
on the momentum of a pretty fun nite of raving.

BTW, am I the only one who really enjoys the "high" you get from
sleep deprivation?  Spaciness, dizziness, hallucinations - entirely
legal (at least for now) and free!

Actualy, if you want names, dates, faces, people, incidents, vehicles,
specific drugs, methods used for CIA smuggling, countries involved, etc.

Just read any book by or listen to any recorded interview read with
Michael Levean (sp?).  He is a former right-winger and IRS, Buruea
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fireams, and undercover DEA agent from the
70's and 80's who was too good at his job of infiltraiting World-wide
drugg smuggling rings in Asia for Heroine and South and Central America
for Cocaine and he found out that the CIA was behind ALL of it.  This 
is over a 10-20 year career of many of the biggest drug casses ever in
all parts of the world.  Nobody even tries to disput his credibility
because he is one of the, if not the most succesful agents ever.  He
was very gun-ho (younger brother heroine junkie -> causes crusading
older brother cop scenario).  He has had attempts on his life and risks
his skin to this day to tell people the truth.  He deserves to be read
for this.

Just one example:  The CIA used the bodies of dead G.I.s from Vietnam to
                   smuggle heroine back to U.S.

Hi everyone out there in encryption land.  Hi especially to the sfravers at\
Wicked the other night (Niels, Derek, Pete, Geoff, etc... :) ) and peace
to you all.  Wicked was alot of fun; had to leave early, was with some
first-timers who burned out early (Sniff!).  Highlights:  partying with 
friends, helping a buddy under 21 get in with my id and glasses :), the
usual meting of new people.  Lowlight:  the fight at around 4:30 or so,
which was a Serious, Hardcore fight.  Bummed me out and had to walk around
the block to deal with it.  Other serious lowlight deserves its own paragraph.

Two of the friends I came with usually party separately from the others and
have cool experiences of their own, and we trade stories of the evening at
the time of our departure.  But I wasn't expecting the story they had for\
me this time:  They felt as though they were followed by some undercover cops
the whole evening.  They ditched the guys 3 times, and finally hid and danced
in a corner the rest of the night.  They kept asking one of my friends all
sorts of questions like "Are you ok?" but they had really unfriendly 
appearances and seemed only to be looking for incriminating info.  Now my
friends are really into the whole scene and are not ones to be "just paranoid"
and they are th most "street smart" people I know.  Add this to the rumors
of narcs in full force these days, and it paints a depressing picture for 
events in the city.  I didn't really ask for any of the other questions that
were asked, but if it happens to you and the people are unfriendly and don't
particularly fit in (wearing a suit, in this instance) please try to cover
yourself if you are under the influence of any drugs with "oh, I'm just really
tired - I only got 2 hours sleep last night" or something.  If you are clean,
confront the sons of bitches.

On a positive note:  Went to Ameba on saturday and talked with Alice, who
gets the nomination for "most inspirational raver" sinceshe always is so
positive and funny.  Told us a story, thought I'd pass it on.  Last weekend
some raver guy comes into the store and hangs out for awhile.  It becomes 
obvious to Alice that he's tripping on something, but she's cool and doesn't
say anything.  After a long time of just standing aroundand looking at shirts
the guy tugs at one on the rack, pulls it out, and then takes off his shirt.
Alice looks, thinks "cool, he's gonna try on a shirt."  Then she looks up and\
he's undoing his belt.  "Ok, he's gonna tuck it in and check it out."  She 
looks away, arranges some tapes, whatever, looks back, and he's standing there
with a puppydog look on his face and his trousers around his ankles, naked.
ALice says she spoke to him like she were his mother: "Oh no, you put your
pants on right now."  He gives a sad look, pulls up his pants and puts on his
shirt, and stays in the store for another hour!
So if you are tripping out and near Ameba, feel free to chill there; they are
cool about it. But don't bare it all, please.....

In a current state of mixed emotions,
Zak

A few questions/comments about Alien Dream Time this friday --

First, does anyone know of another way of getting tickets besides going
all the way out to the city beforehand?  Will tickets be sold at the door? 
The flyer states: "Limited # of tickets available due to the small size of
the warehouse."  If they're so worried about it selling out, why the fuck were
they distributing tons of flyers at Moby/Prodigy???
 
Also, this event is supposedly presented by "Cyborganic Media" - Is this
in any way connected to the Cyborganic Be-In/Mr. Floppy/Psychic TV? 
Speaking of Psychic TV, does anyone know of any upcoming
TV performances/events?  By the way, if anyone was at TAZ, I was the guy
with bleached white hair wearing a black T-shirt with an orange, pointy
Psychic Cross on it.

I certainly didn't get wind of any fights during Wicked.  Not happy at
all to hear that.  I thought it was more than enough crowded most of the
time, although it seemed to loosen up just a bit around 4.  It's
definitely not a very rave-y scene inside Townsend, but we make do as
best we can.  There were the usual over-muscled headset-heads walking
around doing 'security' but being fairly cool about it -- nothing at
all was happening in the main area they could have been concerned about.
For what it was -- Townsend on a Saturday night, fer cryin out loud,
it was actually a bearable scene but I'm glad the alternate much lower-
key situation at King St was available at the same time, because I felt
I could bail from Townsend any time it started going beyond my personal
limit for crush and attitude and lack of danceable space.

     We could, of course, clear the whole matter up right now
with a straw poll.  Forget PGP.  How many people can *rot13*?
Imagine that, an encryption method (by no means secure) which
is _built in_ to most mailers, and _still_ no one knows how to
use it.
     The real problem is teaching people how to use the
system. Not everyone has a Mac, Unix box, or IBM to run PGP.
Not everyone could spend the time to learn PGP (even though
it's user simple).
      If the police really wanted to know, why couldn't they
just monitor all our telnet sessions to vrave?  It's easy to
do.  But quite simply, they don't want to know that badly. I
doubt there's a cop lurker on this list.  Remember, there
*are* other things for a cop to do besides hassle ravers.
They've got enough crack houses on their hands to keep them
busy for quite a while.

Hm.  Well, what if the highly profitable crack houses are
dumping so much money into bribes that the cops have
convieniently forgotten about them?  Or, what if the cops
couldn't care less what happens to black kids, but when you
got white teenagers just like their daughter going to them
rave things, then they get to worrying?  Or what if the well
established clubs such as DV8 decide that warehouse raves
are dangerous competetion, and they bribe the cops to shut
them down?  Or what if it's dawned on someone that ravers
are Easy Pickings, easily demonized in the media, and easy
to attack and score some brownie points with the
conservative and clueless voters?  

Assume there are cops on the list.  Or at least that there
may be.

and acid jazz are his usual line, maybe with some hip-hop).

Bringing stuff is definitely cool, though there'll be some
stuff around in any case.  

I know this is a busy rave weekend, but think of it as a
good warm-up party...

im not sure but someone somewhere mentioened that the FBI

maybe it was just a sarcastic joke and i read it wrong..
but that is serious shit

there HAS to be a cop monitoring the calendar
but i doubt one is reading the list as brian said

but cops will bust raves over crack houses
because, its easier
you dont really have to have a warrant
you wont get sent to court for beating up a black guy
and chances are there wont be any violent confrontations

the media are making raves look really bad
so although crack houses dont really look good
when was the last time one was on the news?
COPS maybe.. but the news?

i wonder. does anyone here watch Cops the tv Show?
and if so, have they ever busted a rave?

Subject: Ravebusters


There seems to be some naivety in the discussion that commenced with how to
keep underground parties underground while spreading the word, encryption,
and lurking cops.

Crack houses are part of the system.  Ecstatic transcendent partying is not.
You can't control people who have already experienced total freedom, and who
are willing to act to preserve that gift.  (Which is why 5-10 years from
now, most "ravers" will be in stable jobs within the system; they have
experienced only partial ecstasy, with partial commitment...just like the
'60's.)  There is an entrenched portion of society acting to prevent the
spread of such destabilizing activities as "exploring the far reaches of 
your own mind."  

We may believe that the more enlightened people become, the less necessary
are the social systems designed to keep "us" in place.  But those social
systems are self-perpetuating, and don't like to lose turf.

Edge-surfers need to protect themselves...without losing the openess without
without losing the openess that preceeds mind expansion.  JFK took acid in
the White House.  Do you think the entrenched powers liked that?

Not that I would ever want to turn this into a metaphysical discussion or
anything, but I don't think it is possible to experience "total freedom",
except possibly through death, and none of us knows what *that* is.

Which is why the enforcers of order really should stop worrying so much.

> There is an entrenched portion of society acting to prevent the

Just like the Catholic Church's suppression of scientific discovery.

Which is why, as nauseating as it may be, we must continue to reassure
the perpetuators of these social systems that their turf is safe.  
Nonviolence, respect for authority, social responsibility, having jobs,
paying taxes, spending money, voting... we may feel like hypocrites doing
some of these things, but ultimately, we are all a part of this reality.
We can ignore it and try to hide from its persecuion, or we can face it
and perhaps have some kind of influence over the preservation of our
limited freedoms. If we want Raving to have any impact on society, it 
cannot be a purely escapist activity.  And if we want the law enforcers 
to look the other way a little, it might make sense to make it worth 
their while.

Has anyone though of putting on an (illegal) rave to raise $ for some 
local Policemen's charity?  There must be some fund for the families of
cops killed in the line of duty.  Would anyone show up?

Subject: keeping stuff alive

Randy is right re: crack houses being "part of the system".  When living in
small-town Ohio, not exactly the most tolerant part of the universe, I had
friends that lived next door to the neighborhood crack house.  Everyone
knew where it was.  It never got busted, whereas a guy who grew pot in his
basement that NO ONE knew about was.

A crack house in the next town over finally got busted after becoming a bit
_too_ obvious even for the gov't.  The guy put one of those "OPEN"/"CLOSED"
restaurant-style signs in his window depending on whether he was doing
business or not.

So long as you're quietly shorting your brain out by financing covert 
terrorism ("intelligence") actions you have to work real hard to get
busted.  Just don't expand your consciousness or they'll stop winking at
your illegal activity -- and since nearly everything interesting is illegal
they have many ways to hassle you.

A co-worker of mine said it best: "The best illustration of democracy in
action is a gang rape.  The majority get what they want and the minority
get fucked."

The only long-term hope is to agitate, educate, disorganize.  Enough people
have to choose freedom when the choice has to be made -- no one can force
you to be free.

Opinion:  Personally, I think that publicity either way will kill whatever
vibe we have left.  The Beat/Yippie ideals were repackaged, declawed, and 
sold back to the gullible by slick companies who turned a rebellion against
their whole paradigm into big money.  People should come into the
"scene" through friends and love, not because it's the hip or anti-hip
thing to do.  It's growing amazingly quickly even with the little publicity
it's had so far -- because raves are FUN and a GOOD IDEA.  We don't need
Sony, BMG, or glossy nonrecyclable flyers to tell us that.
	We've all seen what happens at heavily promoted raves: they 
usually suck.  Let it grow by itself, because it does and will.
Fertilize with the unexpected, add a pinch of luuuuve, and enjoy.

I'm getting tired of seeing posts regarding "The Death of Raving" due to
commercialism, acceptance, MTV, and what-have-you.  What are you guys really
concerned about?  Are you concerned that you can't go to a rave with 1000+
people and not feel the happy qool vibe?  Or are you concerned that you'll
never be able to throw a house party in a basement for 100 people without New
Kids on The Block showing up?

"Death of" is only in your own mind.  There are still people living in
communes from the 60's.  Sheesh, there are still people living without
electricity like the Amish.  My only concern is that it will eventually become
boring to me and I'll have to find something else to occupy all my time.

Subject: Crack houses and "the system"

  I can understand the attitude of frustration many people feel
when dealing with 'the system'

About ten years ago I started reading
articles in the neuroscience
and medical press that indicated to me that the amino acids tyrosine and
tryptophan, and to a lesser extent,phenylalanine,might be useful in
helping people go off crack.. A doctor friend of mine,who has been
using tyrosine in his practice with recovering coke addicts swears by it...
...and has been trying to get financing for a study..

  Great,huh? A potential help or cure to help people get off crack.....
You'd think the government would jump on this and support research.....
especially considering that tyrosine is very,very inexpensive.. a food...

Noooooooooo!

  In the last three or four years I have probably spent 3 or 4 *hundred*
dollars of my own money phhotocopying my neuro papers and sending them to
various government agencies...talking to public health officials..
When shown all the data I've collected, they always agree that there must
be something to this... but *STILL* nothing has happened...


  why?   who knows.... I still havn't given up yet....

Well, here's my perspective on this.  To some of us, there was some hope
that raving was more than a passing music-dance-party fad.  Raving also 
incorporated elements of mind expansion, trance, egolessness, communal 
connectiveness, sensory overload etc., fostered through the imaginative use  
of modern technology and esoteric symbols and themes.  This helped to 
somewhat ink raving to the latest forefronts of modern philosophy where 
scientific discoveries have been merging with the mysteries of 
consciousness.   In addition, raving alsoe seems to support a sense of our 
ultimate Oneness with each other, naturally leading to an increased 
awareness of ecological and community spirit.  

Recognizing that such things would normally be too boring for the brain-
deadened youth of this planet, the fact that raving is also a lot of fun 
made it seem plausible that some kind of increased awareness of some of 
these things could seep in and  perhaps influence the direction of human
evolution.  At the very least, there are some ravers who have been 
stimulated to explore the technology of music and computers, and maybe some 
who have become curious about what fractals are, or who Timothy Leary is, 
or what the yin/yang symbol means, or why a techno band would name itself
Spacetime, or why the perception of time is altered during trance-dancing.

In other words, raving as an activity that connects humankind to new and
challenging avenues of experience and knowledge is what some of us fear 
is dying.

            ^^     ^^^^                                           ^^

Pete, it saddens me to hear you, as a promoter of raves say this.  We know
that you don't do it for the money, so I guess it must be some kind of 
ego trip, or a way for you to make friends, or like you say, just a way 
for *you* to occupy *your* time.  But I'm probably being too harsh here, 
because I'm sure it makes you feel good to help those who attend your 
parties have fun and find a way to occupy their time as well.  Everyone 
having fun is the least raving can be, and there's certainly nothing wrong
with having fun,  it is a safe and easy thing to reach for in life, as is 
the goal of occupying one`s time.  I am sure you will continue to succeed 
in this, so I wouldn't be concerned.

Pete, you got it, that's the point.  When i first used "death of..." i was
referring to the specific ceremonial event the hippies staged on haight 
street after the Time article.  They staged a funeral procession and called
it "Death of Hippie."  Staged in hopes of ending media attention, so life
could get back to the visions at hand.

Things were swingin' when I got  out of the Grateful Dead Mardi Gras
show around 12:30 -- we could hear the Shrove Tuesday speakers all the
way up at the entrance to the Oakland Coliseum, but it wasn't excessively
loud or anything.  In fact, it was nearly the perfect microrave -- good
spinning (Planet 6 up for the time I was there), anywhere from 100 to
200 people dancing or watching and all having a *really good* time.
Partly cloudy and not windy like earlier.  

My friend the organic farming expert and I were heading by on the way
to the car.  In about three seconds he threads right into the middle
of the scene and we got in another 20 minutes or so!  I didn't have to
say a thing, he just jumped in and had a great time.  

Thanks to all who put this on and all who supported the scene. It added
a very nice and definitely not intrusive element to the Dead post-show
ambience.

Subject: Final Call for Zine Submissions



	Call for submissions

This is the final call for submissions to my zine/handbook
for ravers in the Bay Area. I still haven't settled
on a name but contenders are:

				CyberTribe Journal
				CyberStorm
				The DreamTime
				Eternity
				StarGate

The zine is 4.25" x 5.5" and will run around 40 pages.
It will be small enough to fit in your pocket or purse or backpack
so you can carry it around with you to raves.

It will have all sorts of useful info like numbers of stores,
rave-lines and other contacts ravers in the Bay Area should know.

A limited amount of advertising is accepted.

GUIDELINES

This zine is sorta like the Utne reader or Whole Earth review but
for ravers.  Your article should be well written around 4500 bytes,
100 lines or 1000 words unless its prose or poetry.  It should be
informative and enlightening and "positive".  It doesn't have to
be sweetness and light but It shouldn't be life sucks then you die.

I particularly need articles about/from

		Raving in other parts of the world, especially
		eastern europe, asia, south pacific, india.

		Raving and indigenous cultures

		Other forms of "Trance music"

		Raving without drugs

		Female DJs/Promoters

		"Tech articles" on Mixers, portable generators, FM transmitters
		communicators, computer network access, etc.

I will accept artwork as PostScript or maybe GIF files in a pinch. 

When you send me the article, It becomes my property, if you submit it
via e-mail, I will make every effort to send you the edited version
for your approval BEFORE I print it but as the deadline is close, this
may not happen.  I will print your name or a pseudonym you supply as the
author of the article.

DEADLINE
The ABSOLUTE FINAL DEADLINE IS MARCH 1, 1993!!
I will have the zine printed and out for the Vernal Equinox which is
on or around March 21.  The zine will sell for $1 but I will be giving
away a lot as well.  The money from the sale of the zine will go into
covering the cost of printing which should be about $250 for 1000 copies.

The break down is as follows:

	$0.25	cost to me of each copy.
	$0.50	wholesale cost to resellers (minimum order, 20 copies)
	$1.00	Newsstand price.

The zine will be beautiful to look at and will indeed be cute, something
you will want to hold on to for posterity.


So, please send all submissions to:


		umt@nexsys.net

Keep It alive.

A bandwagon jumping poseur?  I'd have a lot more respect for Leary if he

I fear you place too much weight on dancing until dawn with a friendly crowd.
What about people who can't dance?  Who are unable to dance?  What about the
generations who look at everything outside polka and slow swing as noise?  How
does raving bring in the country crowd?

It does occupy all MY time.  Is there something criminal in this Lee?  Am I

Am I cursed because it has had an effect on how much schoolwork gets done?
Should I be shot for typing this letter during work?  Should I ask for

Concerned that I'm just shooting for "fun"?  I'm not.  I get downed when I go
to another rave and people are cruising or there is a bad vibe.  What am I to
do about it?  Sit down and cry over the "death"?  I guess I'm rather cynical
because I've had to wrestle with agents in the background.  Joe Raver seems to
think that Moby is playing for him because he likes San Francisco, when in
fact Moby is playing for him because someone in the building named the right
price.  We invited DJ Dmitri to Salt Lake through a friend at the Wired party.
No response.  Finally I got ahold of his agent through my own means.  $1200
and an airplane ticket.  That my friend, is what is known as the bottom line.

This doesn't mean that I won't continue to do free raves and house parties
when I can afford to.  It just means that there has more often than not been a
price on the door and inside has been an environment that 90% of the populace
would probably find exclusionary.  This is hardly a sense of community.  You
want real community?  Go help out at an old-folks home.  Volunteer your time
to working in a shelter.  Plant some trees.  Pick up your damn candy wrappers
and orange peels.  But most of all, get a grip and realize that raves are not
the end-all-be-all, but merely an escape.

This is not true at all.  RS-232 has certain standards.  The pin out will
always be the same on a 25 pin connector (I've never seen a terminal with an
RS242 connector [9 pins]).  In order to talk to a modem I would suggest using
pins 2-9 and 20.  These are the only ones that should be required.  Note that
a very very very few terminals actually have pins 2 & 3 flipped inside, but
in general the cable should be straight through when connecting to a modem.

Small side note:  I've seen terminals talk to modems with far less than 2-9
& 20.  I'm pretty sure that the only ones that are absolutely essential (as
opposed to just needed) are 2,3,4,5,7,&20.

In other words:

Pins			Pins
2 ----------------------- 2
3 ----------------------- 3
4 ----------------------- 4
5 ----------------------- 5
6 ----------------------- 6
7 ----------------------- 7
8 ----------------------- 8
9 ----------------------- 9
20----------------------- 20

Use the following if the above pinout doesn't work.  I doubt you should
ever have to, however.

Pins			Pins
  _______  ______________
2        \/               2
3 _______/\______________ 3
4 ----------------------- 4
5 ----------------------- 5
6 ----------------------- 6
7 ----------------------- 7
8 ----------------------- 8
9 ----------------------- 9
20----------------------- 20


I think the real issue will be the gender of the RS-232C port on the back
of the terminal.  Most have female ports, but a rare few (like DEC vt100's)
have male ports.  I've never seen a modem with anything but a female port.
So...Make 80% of the cables male->male and the other 20% male->female.

If you have more questions, send me e-mail.

I feel that these movements did have some influence on the world, but 
I'd rather not argue that point.  I feel that the rave scene is 
significantly different from those in that hippies and punks were very
anti-establishment, anti-technology/science, and separatist.  Raving
doesn't reject the world as much as it builds on and takes aspects of
the world to new extremes.  Having a TV showing MTV at a rave would be
lame.  But where a hippie what calmly turn it off and a punk would 
smash in the tube with hir head, ravers would bring in a hundred more
sets and substitute graphics that more fully stimulate the senses.

I think that raving has a wider appeal because it is less rule-based than
other communal activities.  I don't want to be too idealistic here,
because there are certain things the *define* a rave, but I think it's
safe to say that a wider variety of attitudes and expressions fit into
the rave scene, as opposed to the two scenerios you mention.

The point here is that you looked into it and formed an opinion about
Leary and increased your awareness of these "trends".  You just can't
deny that there are aspects of the rave scene that are connected to,
or at least hint at trends in mysticism, psychology, philosophy, 
technology, science, ecology, sociology etc.  Raving doesn't necessarily 
*promote*  any of these things, but give clues to some interesting 
avenues for exploration.  If you decide that it's all a bunch of bullshit
and would rather just dance, fine.  

> I fear you place too much weight on dancing until dawn with a friendly crowd.

Raving can be what we make of it.  Sure, I'm probably going overboard
with the potential of the rave scene, but then again, I  was never really
able to relate the Sex Pistols to Quantum Physics.

You may be damned and cursed, but I don't think you should be shot.  Who

that there are people like you in the world who help make things happen.

Look, I'm not cursing you.  I don't even know you.  All I know is that
our views of what raving is are different.  I also don't think
there's anything wrong with having an ego, but  I do think it is wrong to 
use ego/martyrdom-based experiences to define the limits of a genre for
everyone else.  My overly broad definition of the idealized rave experience
includes "dancing with a friendly crowd" and allows for anyone to ignore 
everything else I've mentioned.  Your definition of raving as "merely an 
escape" seems to preclude mine.  That is my only issue.

The bottom line is that none of this has anything to do with raving and I'm
beginning to see that we are arguing about different things.  But then
again, if we were in agreement, we'd have little to communicate to each
other.  

>  But most of all, get a grip and realize that raves are not

Then when I'm raving, is it OK for me to escape into a fantasy of
communal love awareness integrated with the spacetime fabric of the 
Universe where cosmic forces are leading all of us to an Ultimate 
Oneness with Knowledge and Truth?

A big problem if it is going to save the world.  I'm trying to point out that
it isn't for everybody, and the people who do enjoy it are a very small
minority.  You cry over the death of something that just isn't having that big

Oh, I hadn't received the latest update on who is qool and who is not with the
"ravers".  I guess Moby isn't in the huggy wuggy "community" anymore.  Despite
the fact that I respect Moby's opinion a lot, the point I was trying to make

that reason is usually green.

Yes it does Lee.  There is no death.  Commercialism and money changing have
been here since the start.  The only way you can escape this negative factor
is to throw them cheap and deep.  THIS IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE.  In
other words, the scene never died, and it never will die as long as people are

OK, fuck the world.  I don't think it's unrealistic to say that certain
kinds of raves have the potential to have a sizeable impact on some people 
who experience them.  Is that so hard to accept?

> What I'm trying to state is that my view of raving was similar to yours, once.
> Then I started to peer behind the curtain a bit.

I understand you cynicism.  But if the right type of atmosphere is created
which fosters a special of-the-moment mind-expanding experience for a
raver, it doesn't really matter what went on behind the curtain to help
create it.  If the experience is profoundly enriching in some way, who 
cares if some asshole made a lot of money?
 
>... the point I was trying to make

Like I said, it's the end result that matters; the perpetuation of the
vibe, the stimulation of the senses, the massaging of the mind.  Even if
the sense of love and oneness is based on an illusion, the experience of 
it is real and can have a real impact.

>  Commercialism and money changing have

You are probably correct, although I believe it is possible for 
commercialism and money changing to be done in a positive way.

>THIS IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE.  In

I completely agree with you here. <whew!>  What is dying is the hope that
the underground could have a special effect on the aboveground.  You claim
that there never was any hope for that anyway.  That's where we disagree.

Even if raving is dying/was to die, this is more part of the natural cycle 
of change than a loss or failure.  Breakthroughs occurwhen the amplitude
of a wave of change becomes great enough.  All the other waves before
the successful one were necessary steps toward the end result, including
their individual death.  

It seems to me that raving has already had a special effect on the
above-ground.  Also it has sown the seeds in all who it has touched
for the life and growth of the next similar phenomenon.

True that if/when it dies we will be bummed that there is no cool scene
handy, but that is an almost selfish thought.  The important thing is that
the next cool scene, which will naturally be cooler still than it's 
predecessors, _will_ come along, and in a shorter time interval than that 
between raving and the scene before _that_.

I'm still a little fuzzy on how these thoughts relate directly, but
I'm sure they do so here goes:

When I discovered the dead and deadheads, I was ecstatic.  I was all over
the vibes and started to plunge in.  However, while I like the tunes, I'm
not CRAZY about them, and I never had any taste in clothes, not even enough 
to dress like a deadhead, so while I love going to shows, I never got very
involved beyond that.   

Soon I realized that I really didnt need to be immersed in the subculture.
I learned from it, identified with it, and totally dig it, but the real
value is the good ways that I am/try to be.  Which I have for keeps now.

Does this make any sense?  Even if raving dies, it will leave you all better off.
 
This is the real prize.  It would be nice if raving could touch everyone, but
ravers will outlive raving and _they_ can then go on to touch others.

the kind of changes/changing we are talking about is kind of like votes/voting:
in the end it's the individual that counts.  You can try to change other's
votes but what really matters is the way _you_ vote.

Subject: Re: Cheap terminals and online raving.. 


having just wasted the better part of a day getting a 14.4kbaud modem to
talk to my home unix workstation w/o data overruns, lemme offer some
advice...  (SLIPin' into darknesss...)

the cabling is the easy part -- just buy a standard db-25 modem-terminal
cable (NOT a serial printer cable). alas, many terminal/modems have
different defaults for using or ignoring various control flow signals
(request to send/ clear to send), data terminal ready, data set ready,
parity, on-hook, carrier-detect, etc.  Therefore, you'll typically need to
spend some time messing around with configuration parameters on both the
terminal and modem. Often times, you'll get things seemingly-working by
disabling hardware/sftwr control-flow just to find that your terminal will
occasionally overrun, either on the terminal, modem, or host.... if you can
stick to one kind of terminal and a known modem (e.g. Hayes-compatible w/
default sw settings) then you stand a chance of constraining the
combinatorial explosion of settings that arise in serial communications.

In alot of ways, your best bet is to use an old PC, a standard modem for a
PC, and some cheap/free comms package. Typically, these often work "right
out of the box" without requiring much special set up. This is because most
modems are configured to work with the lowest common denominator, which
happens to be a PC ... and of course if you're just dealing w/ old 1200
baud modems, data-overruns shouldn't be a problem because 1200 baud is
quite slow (in comparison to problems found at 14.4Kbaud, 19kbaud, and
31kbaud).

I don't think you can ftp to or from AOL.com... someone will have to  
download it.  The soda archive is a better place than Sumex, though,
since things have to be submitted (and accepted) to Sumex and when
demand dies down they are supposedly removed. [In reality this doesn't
happen often though].

What things would be cool to bring?  

Well, liquid and solid things mostly.  Personally I'd prefer
you leave the gaseous things at home, or at least in your
car.  

Even alcohol is okay, there's bound to be a bunch of alcohol
people around.

Subject: RE: Deth of Rrraving

I have to agree with every thing that Doug Landau said in his last post, I did
not want reiterate since it was long.

I just wanted to say right now I am very burnt on Raves and the Scene, but it
has really changed and helped me 6 months ago when I discovered it.  I was
seperated from my wife and was going through some real emotional trauma. 
Raving introduced me to many friends that helped pull me through this troubled
period.

Raving also helped me express my creatitivity and allow me to be the sociable
person that I am, which other activities and clubs do not allow.  

I never thought raves were going to be around forever or save the people in a
whole.  I beleive that it was/is a fun fad that has/will help change alot of
peoples outlook on life for the short if not long term.  I do not think that it
was/is some miracle wonder social drug that will make a substantial change in
the worlds future social attitudes

remember people the cool scene is where you are... anything can be a cool scene, if raving devolves it will only be because something is growing up along or out of it or even multiple things. maybe not better things, but things more accurately reflecting cultural expression of the time...

  Hey, maybe susie's got the right idea: how about a New Orleans-style jazz
type funeral (but with techno/house/ambient etc. played by DJs on a float) for
The Death Of Raves. That might bring it all back to life.

My .02 to round out the twenty spot.  Music spawns the scene.  I see the
community built around the music, the djs as our leaders and tour guides
for the trip.  Whence Jeno goeth, people traveleth.  O.K traveling to some
godforsaken town like Freemont to hear Garth isn't exactly a trip to the
holy sepulchre, but shit was is these days.  And when the vibe is strong,
what comes close?  O.K the large scale raves may vacuum a good deal of our
talented dj's into a larger sphere, fine, there are still are number of djs
who play great music and work for smaller fees (Carlos, Moonpup, Rick Preston,
the list continues.)
The underground will be kept thus so not through secretivo map points but by
those who will open their homes, backyards, what have you, to others.  I see
the music growing, and there seems to be a dirth of prospective djs who'll
work for peanuts because they love it.  If no more Gonzo meets Bulwinkle
Love Harvest flyers paper the walls of Tower records and so forth, well so
be it.

Subject: Re: Deth of Rrraving

i totally agree and to add my two sense worth i think that this scene is 
a liberator of technology.what i mean and this is my opinion alone is that 
this scene is doing to technology and dance clubs and that music what 
the Beat scene did for poetry.before the Beats all/most of poetry was 
written by stuffy old men who were living in universities and had only a
detached view of human existence(a little oversimplification here).
the Beats were kids who grew up in the dreges and who wrote about the dreges.
they wrote about the real people.the forgotten people.similar to this is what
dickens did for literature.he freed it up.let it loose.that is what is going on
here and for all of human existence.sure we enjoy it but it is only a stage.it
is a stage at a critical point i believe so i think its applicable here.anywayz
now we have kids who buy a midi and a computer(whatever i am not a total techie so i am not totally sure of the exact names of the parts) and they can create
almost as good music as the million dollar corporations.i have a friend who
was designing rave fliers for a rave group on his Amiga.its techno freedom
and i guess that is what we are hoping for(those who feel the "vibe" and don't
only go there to dance).

Subject: This week's RAVE guide

	Welcome to the land of the infinite sunrise.  There are _13_ 
parties going on between Thursday night and Sunday morning, not counting
the Sunday morning afterparties and Deep Faith on Thursdays and others.
This is actually a good sign in my book - I'd rather see a dozen 500-800
person raves every week than one big 6000 person event every week anyways.
And there is definitely enough raw DJ talent in the Bay Area to support
this. Now if the promoters can all get along together and not try and
undercut each other, maybe there's hope the scene can get bigger and still
have a lot of quality left in it.

	Anyways, if you don't have fun this weekend I can't help you :)
Also, Saturday night is looking suspiciously Garth and Jeno-less.  The
current rumor is they're driving south to LA Sunday morning for a big
birthday party for Doc Martin, and since I'm going down to LA this weekend
anyways I may try to catch that....

	Recommendations:

	Friday night's looking great:  I would probably be most interested
in this Alien Dream Time shebang with Terence McKenna.  I'm not sure if 
it's actually two nights or they put "Friday-Saturday" on the flyer because
the think it's a big deal to go all night :)  I'd stay there for a few hours
and then catch a jitney over to Smiling Thru, the Hardkisses party, to catch
a live (ambient?) set by the Ultraviolet Catastrophe, a threesome of whom
two are on SFRaves (and who put out a wicked killer track last summer, but
you all know about that :)  If Terence McKenna isn't your thing the lineup
at Equinox looks okay (and they're infamous for having really renegade
locations), and for the monosylabically and 21+ inclined OM could be good.

	Saturday night has two pretty good options:  Groove Kitchen (as
always) and Channeling (the Escape promoters have a pretty good reputation).
That Curious George thing sounds like it would at least be a lot of fun
to find :)

	There's a new Sunday morning thang, too, at 1015 Folsom, being
promoted by the same man (Paul) who started the Afterlife at DNA.  It
sounds like it might be worth looking into; only $3, with the basement
being used as the dance floor and the upstairs area will be converted into
a patio area, with a full breakfast and lots of skylights.  But sadly, 
there STILL is no sunday morning non-21+ gig.  Arg.

	And on a sad note, the Orb US tour has been cancelled, so the
suggestion in last week's calendar about organizing trips to see them in
LA and SLC has been postponed indefinitely.  Oh well.

	See you all on the 13th!!

	Brian


ps - special shouts out to Derek Chung, who provides about 75-90% of the
flyer info that gets posted here.  Thanks!!!

This was a ceremony held by Ken Kesey and his merry crew to commemorate

i've cleared up the confusion.  at least Jeff and I will definitely be
there, although in what capacity i can't say.  probably spinning some
records (chill-out type stuff) in the outer room.  we may drag a few
synths along but i want to be out in the open if that happens!  (the
DJ booth in the outer room is upstairs hidden behind the TV monitors.
you can't see the DJ unless (s)he happens to peek through this little
hole cut in the wall.)  if it turns out we can't be out amongst the
people playing our synths i don't see any reason to lug them all the
way up to SF just to hide them in a hot, stuffy, cramped little room
where nobody can see you.  poop on that.

I was told by the cashier/bouncer at Deep Space last week that they've
been charging cover starting at 9:30pm "for the last month or so, we
only did the free thing until 10pm for the first couple of weeks".

Brian, you might want to change the calendar to reflect this, and
those of you heading down tonight should keep this in mind... $5 after
9:30pm, free before.  They also advertised $1 draft beers before 11pm,
which they don't do either, I harassed the bartender about it for fun
last week, as if I care, but it indicates a certain amount of, ahem,
how should I say it, ** flexibility ** on the part of the management
regarding $$$.

I recommend that you show up early and drink nothing, that's what I'm
planning on doing... it makes me feel better.

Again, for those who missed me last time, I am a big blonde guy with
ponytail and glasses, black tshirt, plaid shorts, and switch between
(black toque, white golfer sort of hat with black brim,
cat-in-the-hat) depending on my mood and the crowd...  Come introduce

Subject: Equinox Warning!

My personal experience with equinox is that the promoters don't care
about the comfort and safety of the people that come. They only care
about your money. They provide nothing except the dj's and charge $10.
That means that if you are in a remote location and didn't bring any
water tough luck for you. That means that if they shoved you into the
back of a U-Haul to get to it you probably will not get a ride back
to your car. You will have to walk. Just relating my personal exper-
ience. So be prepared if you go. Dress warm and bring lots of water.
I complained to the promoters at the last one I went to and all the
guy could say was "WELLL most promoters charge $20!!". And he couldn't
really say anything more but "but, but..." when I told him no that
wasn't true. There are alot of promoters that charge $10 and have
plenty of water and facilities for people. I told him he should only
charge $5 cuz he doesn't have to rent a building or anything and they
don't really have much over head. (One strobe and the dj's).

on the subject of raves being busted by clubs, there are a million rumors
that limelight does that consistently in nyc... jacek at the edge is
allways saying how much raves have hurt the club business.... and if you
think about it, the same way promoters don't often claim they made money,
they might very well be calling each other in... plus it's not like cops
can't go to the haight and figure it out for themselves: raves are often
illegal, and if you were a cop would you rather draw fire at a crack house,
or push some kids back to bed.

so i'm sure all these elements are conspiring against us...

about encryption - while i really respect public encryption i don't know
how it would save a public list since all the subscribers would be able to
read teh mail, and unless we started doing background checks the cops could
fake us out on anyway

everything i post, i post with the assumption someone who doesn't like me
is reading, someone who probably could legally mess with me

Subject: Fascist Groove Thang (was Encryption)

Like the song says "...don't need no..."

Having just caught up to the list, and sorted thru several hundred very
interesting msgs, I have a few things to say about this encryption thing.
And mostly from a personal perspective (as opposed to theoretical).

If folks want to post via encryption things like the calendar, I walk from
this list.  As some of you know, I travel about 10 days every month.  I also
haven't physically met most of you.  Consequently, I am not on the "A-list"
of insiders privy to lots of information, nor a "safe" person to disclose
information to.  That's OK.  So I miss the FMR--I can live with that, since
it's one (and from what many of you say, the best) event of the month.  But
if I miss all of them, and miss much of the conversation on the list because
they are encrypted---well, the value of the list goes to arbitrarily close
to zero.

It's also the case that (as others have said) many of the events listed are
public domain anyway.  I can walk into any rave-shop or rave and pick up or
be handed invites to usually 80% of the events listed.  The calendar is
handy to me so that if I miss a week or two because I'm out of town, I can
come back on (arbitrary day of the week) and go out and rave.  

As to the encryption of the major flow of conversation on the list, if that
goes, and key access is restricted to the A-list, well.....but that's too
obvious to burble on about.

Anyway, my suggestion is that if some group of people wish to exchange
messages over a public medium and desire PGP, form another list.  Meanwhile,
remember that clear text lists are just that: clear text to ANY ONE.  By
posting to a clear text list, you are including the world and the future in
your words.

ObRave:
     I went to a rave and had fun.  It was in a big warehouse with a great
sound system and lots of lights.  I handed out floppies.  I danced.  I left
at 8.

I am a sort of crypto expert with a voice product in the works.  I have
considered an encrypted mailing list as a consequence of discussion on
another (too explicit) list I am on and it can be made to work fairly
easily using public keys, public domain code and a major load on the
server.  While some of us are considering setting one up purely as an
experiment, it is subject to all the problems of member trust that has
been pointed out here.  It could only work with a *very* trusted
community, something I don't think we want to get into.  My phone gizmo
will have a patented method for securely establishing a cold call so
the problem of transmission of public keys is solved without a central
authority.  If some people desiring a private list know enough about
each other to want to link up they will soon be able to.

Peace,

Bob

Y'all depressed me with the whole "deth of rraving" thing; so here's a 
rather long post from a book "Mumbo Jumbo" by Ishmael Reed(he lives in 
Oakland now). I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially to 
those of you interested in the "meme" currently known as raving. It's 
(the book) sort of a (conspiratorial) history regarding dance as a phage. 
It was published in 1972.
Here it goes:

1 A True Sport, the Mayor of New Orleans, spiffy in his patent-leather 
brown and white shoes, his plaid suit, the Rudolf Valentino parted down 
the middle hair style, sits in his office. Sprawled upon his knees is Zuzu, 
local doo-wack-a-doo and voo-do-dee-odo fizgig. A slatternly floozy, her 
green, sequined dress quivers.

Work has kept Your Honor late.

The Mayor passes the flask of bootlegged gin to Zuzu. She takes a sip 
and continues to spread sprawl and behave skittishly. Loose. She is 
inhaling from a Chesterfield cigarette in a shameless brazen fashion. 

The telephone rings.

The Mayor removes his hand and picks up the receiver; he recognizes at 
once the voice of his poker pardner on the phone.

Harry, you'd better get down here quick. What was once dormant is now 
a Creeping Thing.

The Mayor stands up and Zuzu lands on the floor. Her posture reveals a 
small flask stuck in her garter as well as some healthily endowed gams.

What's wrong, Harry?

I gots to git down to the infirmary, Zuzu, something awful is happening, 
the Thing has stirred in its moorings. The thing that my Grandfather Harry 
and his generation of Harrys thought was nothing but a false alarm.

The Mayor, dragging the woman by the fox skins hanging from her neck, 
leaves City Hall and jumps into his Stutz Bearcat parked at the curb. 
They drive until they St. Louis Cathedral where 19th-Century HooDoo Queen 
Marie Laveau was a frequent worshipper; its location was about 10 blocks 
from Place Congo. They walk up the steps and the door's Judas Eye swings 
open.

Joe sent me.

What's going on, hon? Is this a speakeasy? Zuzu inquires in her 
cutesey-poo drawl.

The door opens to the main room of the church which has been converted 
into an infirmary. about 22 people lie on carts. Doctors are rushing 
back and forth; they wear surgeon's masks and white coats. Doors open 
and shut.

1 man approaches the Mayor who is walking from bed to bed examining the 
sleeping occupants, including the priest of the parish.

What's the situation report, doc? the Mayor asks.

We have 22 of them. The only thing that seems to anesthetize them is 
sleep.

When did it start?

This morning. We got reports from down here that people were doing 
"stupid sensual things," were in a state of "uncontrollable frenzy," 
were wriggling like fish, doing something called the "Eagle Rock" and 
the "Sassy Bump"; were cutting a mean "Mooche," and "lusting after 
relevance." We decoded this mumbo jumbo. We knew that something was 
Jes Grewing just like in the 1890's flair-up. We thought that the local 
infestation area was Place Congo so we put our antipathetic substances 
to work on it, to try to drive it out; but it started to play hide and 
seek with us, a case occurring in 1 neighborhood and picking up in another. 
It began to leapfrog all about us.

But can't you put it under one of them microscopes? Lock it in? Can't 
you protective-reaction the dad-blamed thing? Look I got an election 
coming up-

To blazes with your election, man! Don't you understand, if this Jes Grew 
becomes pandemic it will mean the end of Civilization As We Know It?

That serious?

Yes. You see, it's not 1 of those germs that break bleed suck gnaw or 
devour. It's nothing we can bring into focus or categorize; once we call 
it 1 thing it forms into something else. No man. this is a psychic epidemic, 
not a lesser germ-like typhoid yellow fever or syphilis. We can handle 
those. This belongs to some ancient Demonic Theory of Disease.

Well, what about the priest?

We tried him but it seized him too. He was shouting and carrying on like 
any old coon with a bass drum.

What about the new patients, did you ask any of them about how they knew it?

Yes, 1, Harry. When we thought it was physical we examined his output, 
and drinking water to determine if we could find some normal germ. 
We asked him questions, like what he had seen.

What did he see?

He said he saw Nkulu Kulu of the Zulu, a locomotive with a red green and 
black python entwined in its face, Johnny Canoeing up the tracks.

Well, Clem, how about his feelings? How did he feel?

He said he felt like the gut heart and lungs of Africa's interior. He said 
he felt like the Kongo: "Land of the Panther." He said he felt like 
"deserting the master," as the Kongo is "prone to do." He said he felt 
he could dance on a dime.

Well, his hearing, Clem. His hearing.

He said he was hearing shank bones, jew's harps, bagpipes, flutes, conch 
horns, drums, banjos, kazoos.

Go on go on and then what did he say?

He started to speak in tongues. There are no isolated cases in this thing. 
It knows no class no race no consciousness. It is self-propogating and 
you can never tell when it will hit.

Well doc, did you get other opinions?

Who do you think some of those other cases are? 6 of them are some of 
the most distinguished bacteriologists epidemologists and chemists from 
the University.

There is a commotion outside. The Mayor rushes out to see Zuzu rejoicing. 
Slapping the attendants who are attempting to placate her. The people on 
carts suddenly leap up and od their individual numbers. The Mayor feels 
that uncomfortable sensation at the nape and soon he is doing something 
resembling the symptoms of Jes Grew, and the doctor who rushes to his aid 
starts slipping dipping gliding on out of doors and into the streets. 
Shades of windows fly up. Lights flick on in the buildings. And before 
you know it the whole quarter is in convulsions from Jes Grew's enterance 
into the Govi of New Orleans; the charming city, the amalgam of Spanish 
French and African culture, is out-of-its-head. By morning there are 
10,000 cases of Jes Grew.

---- this part is in italics(a note from jocelyn)--------

The foolish Wallflower Order hadn't learned a damned thing. They thought 
that by fumigating the Place Congo in the 1890s when people were doing 
the Bamboula the Chacta the Babouille the Counjaille the Juba the Congo 
and the VooDoo that this would put an end to it. that it was merely a fad. 
But they did not understand that the Jes Grew epidemic was unlike physical 
plagues. Actually Jes Grew was an anti-plague. Some plagues caused the 
body to waste away; Jes Grew enlivened the host. Other plagues were 
accompanied by bad air (malaria). Jes Grew victims said that the air was 
as clear as they had ever seen it and that there was the aroma of roses 
and perfumes which had never before enticed their nostrils. Some plagues 
arise from decomposing animals, but Jes Grew is electric as life and is 
characterized by ebullience and ecsatcy. Terrible plagues were due to 
the wrath of God; but Jes Grew is the delight of the gods.

So Jes Grew is seeking its words. Its text. For what good is a liturgy 
without a text? In the 1890s the text was not available and Jes Grew was 
out there all alone. Perhaps the 1920s will also be a false alarm and 
Jes Grew will evaporate as quickly as it appeared again broken-hearted 
and double-crossed(+ +)

The spirit hits them and they follow.

Subject: midweek update



People don't post about Housing Project (weds at the End-Up) very
often, though I see some of you there sometimes.  I've been there
maybe five out of the last seven weeks, so I'm getting to be an
expert.  I'm not feeling creative enough this morning to come up with
an exciting description which won't sound like every other event, so
I'll just give some practical information.  I've been getting there at
around midnight, and it seems to be just getting going around then.
Josh and/or Jeno are usually spinning.  Lots of repeat customers, and
'rave celebrities' (DJs, promoters, etc).  Also, a few yuppie
clubber-types, but not enough to spoil the vibe, especially if you
stay on the dance floor.  Also they have the outdoor patio, for
natural chilling.  It ends at around 3:30, but frequently there's an
after-party...

I also checked out Deep Faith last night, and what can I say?  You 
already know about the DNA and you know about the Hardkisses.  
Good clean reliable fun.  Some people out again from the Housing
Project.  I only stayed till about 2:30, 'cause I got a stomach-ache
(and I didn't get enough sleep the night before), the guest DJ Lee
started it off, really nice groove, nice and consistent, sorta
trancey at times.   Robbie was on afterward, but by then I had
the aforementioned stomach-ache, so I only stayed long enough to
hear one of the UVC remixes...

Tonight: Got some endorsements of Smiling Through, so if I'm still
up I might be there.  Maybe Zanzibar earlier.

Thanks for a most appropriate quote from Ishmael Reed.  He's a genius IMNSHO.

For a dysphoric view of late 20-th century computer-afflicted dancedrivgn cult life,  consider
the Falabala cult in the book "Snow Crash" by Neal Stephenson, where a 
virus which can take either biological, software, or *linguistic* forms
is frying people's brains and turns them into a bizarre parody of Deadheads.
There also a great Perot-like badguy, an satirical/heroic figure based on
the guy in Neuromancer,  a drug-delivery device worn on a woman's diaphragm,
an a whole lot of kewl stuff that's more fun than we can possibly imagine
while doing email.

Another cool thing to do is get a standard slide projector and stick a bulb

then go to yard sales and stuff and get all the slides you can, because you
can only use each one once.
	What happens is, as you look at the slide, it melts in a most
disturbingly creepy and acidic way, duration of the effect is a product of
how fat a bulb you've got.

Subject: Minor Raving in SF

        Hello, my name's Michael and I'm new to this list.  I'm a regular 
on NE-Raves and I live in Washington, DC.  BUT I'm going to be out in SF 
March 6th - 14th, so I figured I'd check out the mailing list before I 
actually experienced an sf-rave.  I plan to go to the FMR and Connection 
II, as I already know a couple of you from ne-raves, and some of my 
ne-raves pals are also flying out.

        My question is this: I'm only 17, and I've heard that a lot of 
raves out there are 21+.  Not only am I 17, but I look like I'm about 15. 
 :-)  This has never posed a problem for me on the east coast (except at 
clubs, but who needs them).  Am I going to run into any problems getting 
into West Coast raves?  Are they strict about over-18 things?  If need 
be, I can scrounge together a fake school ID without too much of a 
problem, but I would prefer to not have to bother.

        Also, what is going to be my best bet for Friday the 12th?  
What's the best event that night?  Note that I prefer a good-vibe to a 
freakshow-circus type thing.  I heard Jeno spin at a rave in Boston about 
two months ago... is he spinning somewhere that night?

        Thanks!

Subject: My weekend....

Friday night I went down to Santa Cruz to see the Dr. Tim Leary lecture.  I
was planning on driving down to LA this weekend but my car sorta vetoed that
idea on highway 17. :( 

It wasn't so much a lecture as a ramblathon :)  While he spoke some wonderful
Hyperdelic video stuff was displayed behind him, and some music (at times 
sounding suspiciously like the Vision tapes) was played, sometimes at high
volume, sometimes not.  To me he came across more as a cyberdelic cheerleader;
he dropped all the current buzzwords like multimedia and right-left brain and
all this without going too much into detail.  He also did a LOT of what
seemed to be free-association, like he'd talk one minute about communication
theory and the next talk about a person back-flipping off a palm tree into a
pool of strawberry jam (???).  Yes, there were threads leading from one meme
to the next, but they were very thin, and it was more like spinning a long
piece of string than a tapestry.  He had a question and answer session which
was pretty interesting; at one point a female college student asked, "yes, it
sounds great and exhilarating, but I feel totally left out; I don't know 
anything about computers and I feel like I'll be completely forgotten in this
new revolution".  Which was a very good question, in my opinion.  Tim basically
said, "We don't want to exclude anyone", and what should have been added was
that you don't need to have a particular aptitude for computers or math to be
a part of it, that as a UCSC student she has free unlimited access to the 
school's computing resources.  But I do see her question echoed by those without
such access....

Anyways, Chris and I managed to find our way over to Bruce Eisner's birthday
party afterward, and in trying to add a few musical entrees on the evening's
entertainment menu ended up screwing up the connections in his RCA "Dementia"
sound system - all was well after finding a schematic to connect everything,
but I've NEVER seen any setup like that before in my life (and hopefully never
will again! :) 

After that I drove up the 1 back to the city (getting a few tingles of 
energy as I passed Bonny Doon) and went to Smiling Thru, the hardkiss's
party just up the street from Slim's.  I arrived to find three keyboards
laid out and Jon and Jeff from UVC sitting behind them tweaking knobs and
sampling rhythms and melodies from a CD player.  Very good to listen to
while watching Fantasia on the TV screens across the room, and the room they
were playing in had a great Egyptian motif.  The music on the main dance
floor was great, and the upstairs was a great place to sit and watch the 
morning traffic go by.... the layout of the club is terrific, as many nooks
and crannies and cool places to hang out as 1015 Folsom.  However, the 
attendance was abysmally small;  there were no more than 6 people on the
dance floor at once, and maybe only 50 people total showed up :(  This is
certainly through no fault of the Hardkisses; they had a lot of competition 
that night and I haven't seen any promotion for it.  Half the people there
were fellow sfravers :):)  I think we should spread the word about this place
because it's definitely the best "club" I've been in in awhile.  The only
problem is its starting time of 4am - but as an afterparty it's great.

All this talk the past week about the death of raves can be put to rest after last nights Channelling. INCREDIBLE. I haven't seen such a quality vibe like that in such a long time. It was so good in fact that I went 8hrs of core dancing without the help of any substances, which says a lot. The promoter (is his name Martin, I can't remember) was obviously in it for us , the group, the collective, the Vibe-at 7:00 Josh got off any an ambient/acidjazz set broke out as muffins, coffee, oranges, and bannanas were handed out. The location was great too, on second near townsend--it had a good non-commercial basics feel.It was actually the location of the first Basics. Durand opened the party(OK), put as soon as Spun broke out with the heavy, wicked beats, the Vibe started kicking...I cant tell you how stoked I am too have my faith renewed in the scene...Tony was on, maybe a bit too techno, and then there was Josh, gettin good and deep-about 5am as the floor cleared out a bit the gr!
oove started getting heavy, the wh
ole floor was holding hands and dancing-this was definitely a family affair by the end of  the night. It was a map point party, which seemed to keep the crowd limited to the perfect size, with almost all core people there for the right reason. Anyhow, I must sleep......

Subject: Weekend/Om

Well, went to Om with a bunch of friends on Friday, hoping to just go crazy and
dance all night.  We had warmed up on Thursday by going to Deep Space; Thomas
closing (although only for around 45 mins.) with some cool, cool tunes.  We
were psyched.

We were disappointed.  Om was at Townsend, same location as last week's Wicked,
and it was Dead - no one there.  That place can hold quite a few people, but
the dance floor was completely deserted with everyone chilling around the 
edges.  Eventually (around 2) there were enough people to sustain dancing, but
there was no real vibe and the party was still quite lifeless.  Apparently
the promoters didn't make it clear enough that it was 21+, but I don't know
how many more people would've gone.

On the bright side of the evening, Tomatsu (Scott) played some really cool 
music that tripped me out, and Spun went off, laying down a ferocious set that
put me into a trance (although I was quite sober), and I got to hear him play
the UVC remix, which kicked!  I left around 3:00, when Jeno came on, and called
it an evening.

Oh well.  I'm bummed about it, but I know that in 48 hours or so I will be
loving life at Come/Unity.  See you all there!

column of "Rave Is..." quotes, much in the style of "Happiness is
a Warm Puppy" would be just swell. So...what I would ask of you is
to fill in the blank and post your one sentence about what "rave is".
An incredibly uncreative example would be:
Rave is staying up all night
but since i have just done that two nights in  a row, my example
wouldn't be too hot...BUT I hope you get the point! Please also
include whether you would prefer to be anonymously quoted...

Ok, howzabout:

"Rave is like putting ones head between two mirrors and not seeing
infinity because ones talking head and its deceptively meaningless
blatherings about what "rave is..." block the view. (with apologies to
Robin Hitchcock)....

Uhhhh, so, excuuuuse me for my inability to be make positive, pithy,
yet insidious statements at this time. But by all means feel free to
visualize world peace, and have a nice day. Because after all, Life's a 
Beach and Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your lives!

Subject: Meat Beat Manifesto/808 State

Meat Beat Manifesto, 808 State, and a third band that has yet to be selected
will be touring late April and early May.  Am I wrong in being depressed at
this lineup?  Meat Beat is always great, but this is their second leg, and I
could care less whether I see 808 State mime their instruments again.  I'm
stuck trying to figure out what I should offer the agents for this tour.  Is
there enough frothing mania over 808 State now to expect a large turnout?  I
lost money the first time Meat Beat Manifesto came around, but do you think
I'd have that problem now that I have a couple months to spare instead of five
days?

_Everyone_ here who saw the Communion tour with MBM, Orbital, and Ultramarine
thought it was the best thing that had hit Utah all year.  I suppose
shockwaves from that could generate a large turnout for this as well.  I've
just heard that 808 State demands ridiculous amounts to play, but I feel
queezy about offering more for this tour than I offered The Orb.

Subject: Channeling

I'll second the thumbs up for Channeling. The vibe was on par with any rave
I've ever been to. 

The space was wonderful, there was probably as much chill space as there was
dance floor, and the little nooks and crannies were many and varied. The 
rooms upstairs afforded a nice bird's-eye view of the dance floor and were
insulated enough from the music that you could talk comfortably. They were
also light enough that you could see who you were talking to.

Spun is back on my god list. He opened mixing between two copies of the same
record, making the ambient intro last several minutes. The dance floor really
launched when the beat finally kicked in. Later in the set he did an
incredible mix of all of the new UVC stuff that lasted about 20 minutes. Then
he mixed into "Hear the Drummer" (the Brrrr Stickum, Ha Ha Stickum song).

In the morning the sun came streaming through the skylights and the energy was
still very high when the closing song was played.
Everyone pitched in and cleaned up a bit and then they put blankets down on
the dance floor and we all sat down for breakfast while James spun some acid
jazz.

Overall the whole night was the most brilliant thing I've been to since the
Basics at the end of November.

Maybe we should think about a breakfast/ambient afterparty for Connection 2.
I'm willing to organize the food.

  I downloaded the "UF Orb" After Dark Module from America Online.  It's very
nice: the words "U F Orb" come floating down diagonally across the screen,
accompanied by that spiked star, which rotates in three dimensions and casts
shadows across the words as it turns.

the net. If someone out here really wants a copy, email me, and I'll give you

shirts they made up for the planetarium listening session.

I don't know about SF, but Detroit got over 808 a while ago. And if this
tour wants more than the Orb, my advice is don't take it. Of course, things
could be different where you are. From a working DJ's perspective, 808=low
rotation.

If you can get me a copy, I'll compress+binhex it and stick it on an RS/6000
here at work, then Brian can FTP it to the soda archive...  We have
several macs here directly connected to unix boxes on the internet,
which beats uploading via modem...send me mail and we can set up a

Subject: adept nude week

thanks to those who made it down to The Oasis for The Ultraviolet
Catastrophe Live Ambiance Attack 93.  due to the fact that we had to
get there at 3.30 AM to set up, i went to bed friday at 8 pm and thus
missed any potential rave type experiences.

anyway.  i was personally pretty unhappy with the set.  a lot of this
had to do with the fact that we had a mono XLR signal running into the
microphone input of the DJ mixer in the upper booth.  the rest of it
had to do with the fact that once the dance floor started pumping, you
couldn't hear any of the subtle effects we were trying to do.

jeff and i had the same experience at the first ambient gig, and i
swore after that fiasco that i'd never do it again.  it looks like i
get to say the same thing this time.  i wonder how long it will take
me to cave in again?

ON THE OTHER HAND... if Connection 2 goes off and the organizers
decide to have a morning breakfast/chill session, and would be willing
to have live ambiance, i might be into it... PROVIDED that there is no
other music being played anywhere else in the space at the same time!!

saturday... channeling sounded good but i opted for spike 'n' mike's
sick and twisted animation festival instead, which definitely lived up
to its name and was quite amusing.  after that, we bopped over to the
terence mckenna thing at the paradise on 11th st, but we arrived just
in time to hear robbie hardkiss spin the last record of the party.
after that exciting two minutes of raving, jeff and i opted for groove
kitchen.  unfortunately, the people who were driving us opted for
saving money and getting to bed early, so we returned to home base.

better luck next lifetime.

808 are playing in miami on march 20th..

i guess this is completely unrelated to the tour that pete mentioned they 
would be doing in late april/early may?

by the way, they are with house of pain, stereo mc's, utah saints, wool, 
and rage against the machine..

pete, if that "3rd group" besides 808 and mbm ends up being stereo mc's i 
might say go for it, because they are supposed to be pretty great live, 
but if the 3rd group is house of pain, well, then, i think we'd rather 
not think about that.

pat the rumor mill back in effect: inside information led me to see the offer put in by a certain well known bay area club owner for an 808/ mbm show with an unconfirmed third band. i don not know who that third band is. but i believe the stereo mc/s and 808 shared the same label on the last release. so its not out of the question.... and although you may be the first in line, i will be the first back stage.... :)

That space, of course, is the old Trocadero.  A minor point - home of
the _second_ basics, the first being in a warehouse near Townsend.  Friends
of mine redid the space and I gotta see the sound system.  Unbelievable,
at least in its Trocadero form; don't know how much of it they kept.
The entire stage was made of large chambers each with a subwoofer, making
the whole stage a resonance chamber for bass.  Midrange was about 6
6ft tall multiple driver boxes, and they hung these multidirectional metal
tweeters from the ceiling.  Way cool.
