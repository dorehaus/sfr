Subject: explicit directions


Here are directions for the rave in Golden Gate Park.

If coming from the East Bay, take the Bay Bridge.  Continue on Hwy. 80 to the
101/Civic Center/Golden Gate Bridge split  (NOT 9th Street/Civic Center,
but the next one.)  Take the Fell Street exit, the last exit from this freeway
ramp... the freeway ends here at a stoplight.  Continue up Fell at least a mile..
You will pass Divisadero.  Fell then ends... actually it splits into two streets
here, once you get to the end of the panhandle of the park.  You want to stay
to the right, actually exit Fell off the right onto a small, one way access
road.  This ends at a stop which yields into Stanyan.  Make  a right onto
Stanyan, and get into the left lane.  Make a left at Fulton (there is
a signal and a left turn lane).  Go up Fulton to about 25th street...
then you can park on any of these side streets.  The rave is across the
street, in the park, over the small hill... you should be able to hear
the music.

>From the south bay, the directions are nearly identical... you would still
take the same exit.  In other words, at the 80/101 split continue on 101,
then take the Fell Street/Golden Gate Bridge exit.

If the Fell street directions sound too confusing, you could get on Haight
Street and go all the way up Haight... then make a right on Stanyan and a
left on Fulton.

OK, now that the flames have died down, and all, I have a question for folks
on both sides of the Great Divade ...

* If you hate "wailing divas", what artists and songs drive you absolutely
  bughouse the quickest and/or worst with their evil yowling from hell?

* If you love "wailing divas", which artists and songs constitute the finest
  ambrosia for the ears and body?

(I'm sort of curious if they work out to be the same or different lists.)

  I don't think that wailing divas are all that bad.  I mean When I first
started to listen to house, I really didn't like them, but since the music
was so great, I got used to the voice, and now it's not bad to listen to.
  I don't know her name, but I love the voice of the woman in the group
Black Box.  I also think that Maxine Harvey is great.  she sings on s lot of
KLF songs.
  I really don't like Crystal Waters (that never-played-enough tune...gypsy

I've lurked on this mlist since the beginning, and it has been
consistantly friendly and positive.  I don't think the occassional
flame is anything to worry about.  The openness of the rave 'culture'
is not (I hope) so fragile and contrived that a transient bad vib
or two can't be absorbed, digested and smoothly excreted.  I do feel
however that creating a rule such as `no flames allowed' smacks a
little bit of oppressiveness.  The flow has been good, and my guess
is that it will continue... Just my $.03

I disagree.  sometimes it's fun to be insulted.

sorry, but I *beg* to differ.  I've seen some of the
most creative and interesting dialogue happen in flames. 

> they dont belong on sfraves nor should be associated with raves at all

in my opinion, sfraves is enriched by flames.

why ?  it's not reality.
I do agree that being friendly in person is desirable,
but on the net ?  who needs to be nice on the net ?

I just got back from Groove Kitchen where Preston said that there would
definitely be a daytime rave in Marx Meadow on Sunday.  He hasn't been 
having them every week and doesn't plan to start.  He's just planning to
do them on holiday weekends or other special occasions.  Hope you all have 
fun at the picnic/rave!  Alas, I won't be able to join  you.

Groove Kitchen was fun, but expensive for a Thursday night ($12).  Doors opened
late (11:30 instead of 10:00).  Took a while to get off the ground.  Harry Who?
started out the evening.  I'd never heard him spin before.  More on the techno
side than the house side, but fun.  The place started getting more crowded
around 1:00 and peaked around 2:00 while Doc Martin was spinning.  Had to leave
before Thomas came on.  Security was tight -- no ins&outs.  No back packs. 
Close scrutiny of the IDs.  And a frisk on the way in!  (Woo!  Don't touch
there!)

Subject: Midsummer Night's Dream....


was great, even with the few caveats. (Previous mood: a little tired, a little
trepidatious because I had a friend with me who'd never been to raves before).
While waiting outside around 1 I began to worry when most of the crowd looked
really young (who am I to talk, right?) but when I stepped inside I was 
overblown by the energy. People dancing on top of bass bins ALWAYS seem to
do it for me. The sound system was crystal clear, if a little quiet at times.
The size of the club was just small enough to feel cozy, but large enough to
hold a lot of us and keep some cool acoustics. The laser they had going
was the best part: they were shining it on this chandalier of disco balls,
probably 12 in total, of differing sizes, producing this incredible
laser-rain effect, in combination with the fog machines. At other times the
laser was having some animation fun with the Sharon triangle logo, at other
times creating the most beautiful wave effects on the other wall. I think it
helps to have a real person there rather than a random-number generator and
a computer. The people were friendlier than I thought they were going to 
be, too :) The main problem I had was with the music; for the most part it
was great, but at times both Hardkiss and the DJ before him would leave huge
gaps in the music, 15-20 seconds or longer. Hardkiss also seemed a little
sloppy in his mixing; I could almost always tell when he had changed songs, and
sometimes he waited for the song to end cold before he'd start the next. Oh 
well. He made up for it by playing some brain-wracking tunez despite all
that....Also, does the world _really_, _really_ need a techno remix of Van
Halen's "Jump"? Huh? I didn't _think_ so!!!!

A quick question for all the ladies on the list: do us males who don't take
our shirts off while dancing have any chance on the dance floor against those 
who do? I would put a *smiley* here, but I'm half interested in the answer;
at this and other raves, a large number of the guys are shirtless, and they
seem to always be the ones doing those techno-lambada moves.....

Brian, where was this at?  Sounds almost like The Trocadero at 4th and Bryant.

"Introduction to Raves" for a file I have (it's called the FutureCulture

our culture [raves, cyberpunk, virtual reality, nootropic drugs, etc., etc.])

I need a new one, because the one I have in there now is that big ole article
from the SanFran Examiner that Vit B retyped a few weeks ago, but that thing
is just too huge...And, the ones I've tried to write are pretty limited, cuz I
live up here in Colorado where the Rave scene is still in a fetus-like state,
so, obviously I haven't had as much experience as some of the Englander/SFer
crowd..... 

Anyway, what I'm looking for is....Say you had to describe the ENTIRE RAVE
EXPERIENCE to someone from, say, Alabama - How would you do it?  This would
have to include things like music (what does techno sound like if you've never
heard it?), lasers, graphics, clothing, toys, drugs, smart drinks, 
ravelines/map-points/drive-n-drive, outdoor/indoor, etc., etc.

I thought about typing in that article from Details, but, it was way way way
too negative for my tastes....

So anyway, if anybody's got some spare time on their hands and would like to
help me out (begbegbegbegbeg), then PLEASE (begbegbegbegbeg) write one up and
send it to:

it's to see "curveball" at slim's.
I don't know the music, can't
promise anything, but it's free.

I've been reduced to asking two
hundred people to try to get 
one person to do something with
me.  what does this mean ?

I think the show's at nine, I'll
probably drive over from berkeley,
except maybe not.

I'll be checking mail till ~1:30 pm,
after that it's 510.845.5711.

call me.  but not before you've read my .plan ...

also, if you want to see the show for free with
someone besides *me* < how DARE you > call me,
and I'll tell you what name the tickets are 
under, since I probably won't end up going.

it might be way too exciting for my dull life.
might be safer to watch tv.

If you have a torso worth showing off, then by all means do so.  

But I agree with the question:  "'chance' at what?"  Do you mean,
"Will I dance better if I take my shirt off?"  Do you mean, "Will

this was the sort of thing that one didn't have to deal with at

I sorta meant the latter, but more like, "Would females rather interact
and be friendly towards guys with their shirts off", not if they would
lunge at me like a pack of rabid poodles. ;-) 

It's just been my impression that the guys w/o shirts are constantly
surrounded by females... not that this is a rule or even necessarily
a bad thing... I just wanted to see how women on the list felt about it
or related topics, since we hardly ever hear from them....

p.s. - I wasn't bemoaning the fact that the rave scene isn't a meat market;
as a matter of fact I'm VERY glad it isn't. But that doesn't mean I don't 
like dancing and interacting on the dance floor with members of both sexes.
The overriding thought in my mind, of course, is that at the good events all
these thoughts melt down into nothing, and people dance and interact with
everyone, male, female, straight, gay, black, white, purple, everyone. Maybe it
was a stupid question; but I reserve the right to ask stupid questions. ;-P

	It gives me enormous amounts of pleasure to see a post like this.  I
admire Dana's idealism in his attempt to transcend differences as part of a
quest for community.  I feel, however, that conflict is actually part of the
process of building unity.
       I'm reading M. Scott Peck's "The Different Drum:  Community Making and
Peace"; I managed to find a copy of it in the clearance bin of a bookstore here
in Rochester for $2.  If you don't already know, Peck is the author of a number
of self-help books, including "The Road Less Traveled".  I haven't finished the
book yet, but I strongly recommend it for anyone who desires to be part of a
community building process. (It's published by Simon and Schuster,  ISBN #
0-671-60192-X.)
	Peck suggests that there are four stages in the construction of a true
community:  pseudocommunity, chaos, emptiness, and finally the sought-after
community.  Pseudocommunity is the stage in which the group initially forms,
and everyone is polite and nice.  Eventually, though, differences between
people begin to manifest themselves as the original facades begin to come down,
and someone gets on someone else's nerves.  This is the chaos stage.  The
interesting part of the chaos stage is that often the biggest contributors to
the chaos are those with the highest intentions, the people who have the
strongest desire to "convert" people over to their way of thinking.  This can
potentially lead to organization, a tendency that could possibly degenerate the
chaos back into pseudocommunity again.  A healthier response to the chaos,
however, is one of emptiness, an abandonment of personal agendas or prejudices. 
I can't define this emptiness any further than that it is a form of death. 
After the hard work of emptiness is done, however, comes the joy of community,
where differences between individuals can be accepted, and true love and peace
among members of a group can flourish.

 Now, not only do I feel dumb about forgetting my SFR badge at home, but I
feel guilty as well ! SFR wuz there - maybe we should have had a flag flying.
( Mmmm - maybe I'll get some day-glo clothes paint and make an SFR banner
for our next gathering - I was lucky enough to find the table when there
were SFRavers standing next to it ).
 
 Chris, Lee, Derek, Giamma, Voodoo Chile, Shiva's Son, and some other folks
were there, at various times. I left at around 3PM to buy some records, and
didn't get back until around 5PM. Maybe you saw me, I was wearing a beige
t-shirt with a cartoony wizard on the front.

  They found a table for the turntables later ..., even then, they had trouble
with the table itself not being level; the tonearms would skip out of the 
record grooves occasionally. As far as the crowd enthusiasm level, there was
a lot more people up and dancing by the time I got back at 5PM.

 By the way - was there actually any discussion of a future SFR event?

	Mea culpa. I was so tired from having stayed at Let Freedom Rave until
6 that I slept until noonish, and then other things prevented me from getting
to the park until 5ish.  I'm sorry for the confusion; you both should have
stayed for the music, because the atmosphere and the people were great, at
least when I arrived. It got shut down about 7 or 7:30, but there was at least
300 people there when it was (meaning it was probably even larger early on).
I was wearing my button :)  So, I'll make it up to you all in the near future.

	I also got a chance to hand around flyers with information about the 
sfraves list. I spent some time the night before toying around with Corel
Draw, trying to come up with words that would convey the idea of the list and
how to get on it. I printed up about 150 on flourescent paper and handed them
out to groups of people. I didn't discriminate too much to who I gave it to,
except to say I knew the words would probably mean more to someone who looked
like they were enjoying themselves there. I got overall a good reception from
it; there's a lot more info on it than normal rave flyers, so it may have been
a little busy for some, but I also got more than a few people saying it looked
like a very cool setup and thanked me for doing it. Gee... :)

	Anyways, here's the text to the flyers. I showed the flyers to a couple
of SFRavers first before distributing it, and they thought it was okay. I'd
sorta like to hear your reactions to it, in case I want to print some more up
later on. I'm not going to hand these out at big events, nor have stacks of 
them at Ameba or BPM, etc., but I may print up a limited number once a month
and hand them out at GG Park events, or maybe a Come Unity, or something where
the level of people who really do care about the scene is high. 

I used lotsa different fonts. I'll try and get a PostScript version of this

A few comments:

If anybody want to help rewrite that last part, about how to get on the 
Internet/Bitnet, send me mail. I definitely want to make it sound less
commercial; maybe if there's a voice phone number for Netcom that would sound
better. I lost my number for the Well; also, I just remembered there are 
several people on Compuserve on the list. So, if there's a better way, which
I'm positive there is, let me know.

I may have committed a fau paux (sp?) by putting my phone number on the
flyer; I'm a friendly person with a lot of patience, so I don't mind getting
a few calls from people wanting to get on, as long as hundreds of people
start flooding my phone. No one's called yet, so I think it's safe. But if
anyone doesn't like the fact I'm doing this I guess I'm an easy target now...

The beginning is cheesy, yes, but what rave flyer isn't? :) I just wanted
to get the point across that I find this list breathtaking at times. And
I think others do, too...

Before you all complain about the bridge and tunnel crowd finding its way
onto the list, I feel confident that the majority of the people at the park
were people I'd want on the list. Also, it takes a smattering of intelligence
to get on the net; not too much, but enough to filter out the meat-market
crowd, I hope. 

	I guess we'll see....

Was anybody else's car broken into during the Let Freedom Rave?  My trunk was
broken into.  I also saw three young looking guys in their late teens,
non-raver looking, wearing really dirty clothes who were trying to drive a
green lincoln continental that I strongly suspect is a stolen vehicle.  I went
up to their car which was next to mine since I noticed one guy suspiciously
scoping the cars in the lot.  He was waiting for his 2 friends and when I
accosted their car, all three of them had this look of fear written on their
faces.  They looked like runaways.  They desperately tried to convince me that
the car was theirs and they succeeded until they took off.  As they were taking
off I realized that the drivier didn't even know how to change the gears of
this automatic car (with the shift located above the steering column).  I
should have listened to my gut feeling....

Let me preface this with: there is denial everywhere. You can't escape it.
In its attempts to analyse the incredible amount of info it recieves, and
make decisions and value judgements, your brain must decide what's important
and what's not.  Social activities that promote various "mindsets" give 
guidelines on what to scrutinize and what to ignore, but you can't totally
live without it. But yes, maybe there is more than there should be at raves
(also college, also jobs [are you _really_ happy where you're working?], music,
every social interaction I can think of).

How much of this is a product of the rave scene and how much is it a product
of the people there?  I don't think you can blame the atmosphere, one in which
all varieties of clothes and shapes and physical builds are accepted.

I definitely don't think that the above has to happen. Drugs: If you feel you
have to take them, do it in moderation; know your limits. It's like having sex
once an hour would just decrease the satisfaction you get from it each time. 
There is such thing as a "safe level". Diet: Eat more! Get lotsa vitamins
(vitamin C is supposed to increase the intensity of a trip anyways), eat
larger meals, etc.  Dancing as exercise is just about as good as you can get,
up there with cross-country skiing and swimming (even if it is hard on the
knees). Staying up all night will certainly add lines to your face - just ask
any computer programmer :):):). Take care of your body, is all I can say.

I'm probably just oblivious, but lotsa people looked alive and on fire at
about 6 when I left. I was sure it would go on until 10 or noon even.
Supposedly smart drinks are designed to help with the vitamin and 
electrolyte deficiency, and by some accounts they work.... I never have
a problem finding the calories to dance, either.

You can FTP the Ecstasy FAQ from ftp.u.washington.edu under /public/alt.drugs
(I think), or if you don't have e-mail access I can maybe mail you a copy.
It's just about the most unbiased, up-to-date information you can find. You can
also download a bibliography of books relating to drugs in general, and more
than a few on MDMA/MDA. 

I have not heard the above rumor.  All I have heard is that the drug reduces
the serotonin level in your brain, which gets restored within a few weeks.
This also depends on what dosage you take. I've seen the figure of one every
month as being safe. 

They did a study with chimps, giving them the equivalent of four doses four
times a day for a week, and then analysed their brain serotonin levels
for up to 15 months later. Their levels got back up within a few weeks, but
never returned to full, instead staying at about 90% of normal. Whether that
had an effect on cognitive abilities is another question.

Unfortunately, American traditional culture causes most people to keep
thoughts to themselves, to not share, to not express, to not walk up and
talk to strangers or accept candy from them (you would not believe the 
trouble I had handing out lollipops to people Saturday night)... and drugs
take this inhibition away. So what else is new. Drug-induced social
gatherings have been a part of society since the stone age. BUT - what
I've seen happen in many people is that once they've tried a drug, they
realize how fundamentally bizarre and wrong many of these precepts are,
and become friendly and happy people even when sober. Oh jeez, this is
starting to sound bad, real bad, like I'm advocating drug use. I'm not.
All this "attitude adjustment and acclimation" can happen through education,
through opening your mind to other ideas, other realities.... something
I'm trying to foster on this list. This sounds really corny, but I AM this
happy and friendly sober, and I like to think I'm not naive or some mutant
or something.... When I'm at a rave SO many people I meet go, "So what are
you doing? X? How much did you get it for?" and I confess I'm not doing
anything.  If denying the dark realities of life when I feel like going
crazy is bad, let me be guilty. :):)

This is a bad thing? This is something new? Yes, if they are refusing to
face a reality that is on its way to crush them, like a bad financial
situation, escaping as a _bad_ thing. In that case, the rave is an easy
excuse. But for non-life-threatening problems, people have ALWAYS been
looking to escape them. I'm as guilty as anyone else; I blew off school
last semester and am working to recover lost ground.  But I don't think
going to raves and being friendly there and being happy is particularly
denial. I mean, I don't go to raves and tell everyone I meet, "Yeah, I'm
failing school, my girlfriend left me, and my car died." I have e-mail for
that! (hee hee hee) Yes, raves are an escape, but that's a GOOD thing. 
It's not denial. If somebody decides to drop everything else in the world,
their job, their school, everything, and dedicate the rest of their lives
to hanging out at BPM and Ameba during the day and raving 7 nights a week,
that I would worry about.

WHATSUP, SFRavelings?
	I wanted to comment on a couple of things I've enountered over the 
last few days.  
	1.)  I was at the picnic on Sunday, of course I lost my button, but 
we did have a significant turnout of people there.  Giamma. Geoff, Derek, 
Larry, Bob, Brian, Jai, Nineball, Chris, and a few more.  One fellow had SFR
made out of blue(?, I could be wrong here) paper taped to his back.  I didn't
get a chance to introduce myself but he looked like he wqas having great fun.
Anyway, this picnic/meeting was (*to understate*) a bit disorganized.  Chris 
made a nice suggestion about having the next get-together down at Baker Beach.
I went down there after they had stopped spinning(records!) in Marx Meadow and
it really would be an ideal place.  What do you think?  Perhaps, after the next
GG picnic?
	2.)  I haven't yet seen any input about 'Let Freedom Rave'!  Again, I
saw quite a few SFRavers there and had a BLAST!  The rave was held in a motor-
cross track surrounded by some grassy knolls on which one of the laser shows 
was projected.  The dance area was surrounded by stacks of differentially-con-
trolled speakers.  I heard 4000-5000 participated.  All I know is that turnout 
was HUGE!  I moved around from speaker stack to speaker stack and met some real-ly nice people.  Around 7am the sun had emerged from over the hills, Garth(?) 
was spinning and people were still up and dancing.  It even got warm enough for
me to take off my shirt and engage in the dreaded 'tekkno-lambada'.  Of course,
I'm not one of major torso, but I did need to get out of my sweat-drenched shirtand enjoy the sunshine and cool breeze.  I can't give a real detailed account,
since I started dancing immediately after I came in ~12:45pm and didn't stop 
until the last song.  As far as large raves go this one gets a 9!

busier rave fliers that had far less usable information.  I'd be happy to take 
some to distribute up here in the Sacto/Davis area if you like.
	4.)  A short comment on the non-flammatory reply to TAXI.  BTW, I hope 
to see you at Come-Unity!  Personally, I find that people, especially at partieslike Come-Unity, are exceptionally friendler than at large raves, LFR was a re-
freshing exception.  But in all cases, I find that if you get out there and 
just enjoy, the people around you also seem to tap into your energy and whether 
drug-induced at that point or not, become quite friendly then (smiles, hugs, 
high fives, kisses, etc.) and later. (e.g. Hey!, I saw you at so-and-so what's
going on? blah, blah, blah)  I tend to believe that if you show your best side
it can work positively for the whole rave scene and carry over beyond it as well	A second(?) thought(?) was that it is imperative that whatever, scene 
you are involved in you should listen to your body talk.  Eat a good meal, hy-
drate yourself adequately, get you sleep, and simply do not overdo it no matter
how much fun it is.  A little abstinence can elevate pleasurable sensations to
new heights!(If you're in the right company).

	Okay, to complete this discourse, I'd like to ask who all is going to 
Come-Unity.  I feel like I've been on this list long enough and have gone to 
enough of the same raves and parties that I should know just about everyone! (orat least I should have met you once and forgot your name!)   Anyway, you can, ifyou so desire, respond directly to me, so as not to clog everyone's directory 
senselessly.  morris@gnl2.ucdavis.edu    I'm not sure what I'll be wearing as I
am not that well-organized, but three things are certain(?); I will be there, I
will be bald, and I will be baggy.  Look out for me!

Hmm.. denial and raves..
well i have to admit that i have a few problems in my life
but going to raves is one of them
i just cant fucking afford it
so my financial problem is rave created, i dont use it as an escape

i dont think i would deny that i go to raves because i am a lot happier
there than i am when i am in a bad relationship or something like
that, but i consider that to be a healthy thing
like EVERYTHING else, raving should be done in moderation

i agree with brian that a lot of people first open up because of 
drugs, but then realize how much better it is and stay that way.
this is something that has to do with the people and with the drug
that they take, release of inhibitions due to alcohol tend to make
people do things that they regret because of a 'machismo' attitude
that either the alcohol or the personality brings about
but most of the people at raves just act friendly and more open
which is good, hopefully it gets contagious and whether or not
you are on drugs you will also be open

the one thing i dont see a lot of is negative openness
so many people are open & friendly instead of open and bitchy
is this good?
i dont know

philsophy behind raving...hmmm..

I've met lots of people at raves and I've become friends with many of

under the influence of drugs.  I personally am quite shy but find it
easier to be open while altered at raves.

Besides, the rave scene appears pretty mild compared to the amount of
people permanently destroying brain cells at bars every night while
imbibing alcohol in order to "loosen up."

I'm definitely going to Come-Unity.  My 90 minutes at the one in June

Your post got sort of garbled (something about you UC Davis guys, your
VMS, and PacBell's SUnOS does this kind of a lot).  Are you soliciting
ideas for a post on "safe raving" or was that it.  Seems like you and
Brian have made most of the points about keeping your body going, &c.
Philosophically (dare I say it) I like to look at raves as a positive
addition to my life and not a way to get out of it.  I think some
folks may get into trouble if they for whatever reason can't really
tell the difference between just getting acquainted with somebody and
actually having friends you can count on.  That may be something
behind what TAXI was talking about.  For that mattern, X may be a
little different from other substances people ingest in the way it
creates *social* hallucinations.  That's too strong a word but I think
it takes some perspective to kind of grow one's relationships ( I
think the list is good for that ), and not just thrash around on the
surface (tho that's fun too!).  I once saw X lead a couple I knew to
sustain a bad relationship that should have been either fixed or
ended.  If it's a doorway, folks should know when to walk *thru*.  So
yes, there can certainly be rave abuse if it keeps somebody from
enjoying other stuff in life.  As for me, well, sometimes I wish I
could get anywhere *near* that problem :-)!  All in all, rave is the
greatest antidote yet for urban anonymity.  Somebody with greater than
knowledge than I of gay disco culture, Grateful Dead shows, 1967 acid
parties, carnival, rasta, and obscure British youth trends is gonna
write one hell of book about it!

When I was at a rave in brooklyn (storm rave 4) a friend and I brought

it was incredible the amounts of stares and nasty looks we got from the

We were all the way at the end of the meadow, the far right if you're
facing the sound system.  We didn't really come together until about
1:30-2:00.  I had arrived as 12:00 sharp, and was also wandering around
aimlessly. I probably saw you but didn't know who you were.  I don`t
have a button.  It was rather amusing actually; I would wander up to
a few of the cliques who were lounging about and ask "Anyone here from
the sfraves mailing list."  After getting a friendly "Huh?", I would
explain that "We're a bunch of raving geeks who communicate by computer,
many of us have never met face to face."  "Hey, that's cool!"

I eventually decided to just space out, then the music started up.
While I was dancing I saw Bob (the only person on the list that I've
met), and the rest is history.  It was good to meet Larry, Chris, Fred
and the others whose names I already forgot.  The park scene was the best
one yet for me.  There was one couple who looked to be in their 80's
dancing.  2 cops on horses came to watch for a while and left in peace.
I only wish it could've lasted longer.  Hope to see more of you next
time.

their natural clock (unless they're natural-born owls).

well...
first, dancing all nite long has probably done wonders
for me cuz i dont get any other exercise,

second, it has been proven that one can live on
an hour and a half of sleep a day
Da Vinci did this sleeping 15 min every 3 or 4 hours
and well... looking at how productive he was
i know a few people who have experimented with this
and they all have changed their lifestyles so that they can do
this all the time and feel much more productive

afterall, it really doesnt matter how MUCH you sleep
but how WELL.
last night i got about 4 hours of sleep and i feel horrid
cuz i was cold and uncomfortable
had i been more comfortable and gotten 3 hours of sleep
i would probably feel wide awake

third, just because society thinks that the majority of
people are 'day' people, doesnt mean they are
although im sure there are 'day' people and 'night' people
i personally can function well at anytime given that
my brain/body have rested, so im not to good at 
understand morning/night people, but i guess i can
believe that if someone tried to change their lifestyle
by going to sleep early enough to be a morning person
then they still might not agree with it

excellent lights and lasers, nice space.  a bit too crowded for me.

saturday was let freedom rave in the middle of nowhere (aka
livermore).  i was freezing most of the night, but the crowd, music,
location and lights more than made up for any minor physical
discomfort.  if you missed this one, i pity you.  a wild party on a
huge dirt track, with fireworks, lasers and intensely great music all
night long (although Garth didn't impress me on the early morning
shift).  DJ Spun played our hot-off-the-presses 12" single and I cried

Someone once told me that we spend most of the night trying to get 7 minutes
of deep sleep.  Another person related a story he read in Omni where the
reporter tried a sleep schedule that someone had come up with.  You sleep 4
hours a night, then 15 minutes every four hours.  Supposedly this will throw
you into deep REM sleep every time you collapse.  The reporter stated that it
worked, but he went back to his regular schedule because he was so bored.
Apparently he had too much time on his hands.  I don't think myself or most
ravers would have this problem :-).

Personally, I hate sleep, but I need a lot of it.

I think that sleep researchers would tell you that most people
would be in the looney bin after a regimen like that.  I'm sure
it would work for a few.  There's a lot of variation out there
in the human race.

No, no, it's not "society" , it's your body that has natural rhythms
-- if you don't believe me, try this simple experiment: buy a plane
ticket to Tokyo or London, & fly there.  See if you aren't doing
things at odd times of day -- hungry at the wrong time, sleepy at the
wrong time, &c.  It takes a few days or even weeks to adjust, for most
people, to whatever schedule they want to be on.

I am going to be in NYC for 2 weeks in august, and am interested in hooking
up with some techno nation events, but don't really know where to start 
looking (well, except for the usual rekkid stores for flyers) I'll be
staying uptown at the Columbia U. International house, but will also be down
in Brooklyn checking out some of my friends. Any ideas on where to start?

Well, you could.. When you think about it, every experience changes your life.
"life" is not some static thing that just sits there with rubber balls of
experience bouncing right off of it. Hey, I like that! "Superhigh's anti-
rubber ball theory of experience and existance" Anyway, my point is that
X did change your life, like it or not.. Sounds like it changed it for the
better to me.

No one's complained about equinox on Friday yet, so let me!  I think it was
in the worst space I've ever been to for a rave; it was essentially in 
office space - that is, the floor was carpeted, the ceiling was about 
10 feet high.  The crowd wasn't big enough or energetic enough to make
up for the space (burned out from Midsummer Night's Dream?), and the
cops (mercifully) shut it down at 3.  Actually Brad or someone told me that
the cops came and left but the organizers shut it down anyway; things
were moved to Big Heart City, but I wasn't too hopeful for a killer
rave to break out, so I went home.

The night before at Midsummer Night's Dream was much better, and I saw
a lot of you guys there; unfortunately, I had to leave early because my
brother was not quite up to the all-night thing; he had flown in from the
east, so by 3 am he'd been up for 24 hours.  I'm getting him on the
rave schedule though :-)

See y'all at Come Unity!

Rave hard,

Health? Sleep? Are we yuppie ravers?

I thought the whole point what to see how bright you could burn
in the night, not how long....  And I'm naturally a night person,
the day just hurts my eyes...  Also, I need a good 10-12 hours to
be really happy, anything less, well I'd just much rather return
to my coffin and hang out...

As for Da Vinci, he was strange, very very odd... So what kind
of conclusion can I draw from the parallels you made between
you and him? :-)  (strange looking face, kinda boring...)

I'm from LA, and the scene is, if you will, night and day
from the SF arena...  Anyone have any opinion (such big
words for such mindless fingers) about which raves are better
than others...  I find myself surrounded by happy-go-ravers
but I'm new to the SF game and need a little direction...

yes it does take a bit to adjust to a new schedule, but had
we all grown up sleeping during the day and staying awake at night
then thats what the natural schedule would be

your body is NOT hungry at the wrong time, it is hungry at the
exact same time it would be if you were anywhere in the world

i have to admit that it is more the fact that people couldnt work
at night that started us in this trend, but it is amazing
how many people think it is the only possible way

personally being up at 5 am when no one else is, is great, 
i have a lot more freedom

im not saying that any of this is positive,
there HAS been SCIENTIFIC research done affirming this
people need to be open to other solutions

personally, though, i like sleeping, dreaming and all that stuff
one reason i like staying up til 3 am regularly is that
it feels SOooo damn good to crawl into my bed or my floor
or just drop dead on the floor of a warehouse somewhere

i just am trying to make the point that sleep is something that
people have made a lot more important than it is
its not something that can be ignored, just there is more than
one way of dealing with it than the general concept that society has

I am, therefore I rave.

As far as sleep goes:

Are there any sleepwalkers out there?  The obvious solution
is to learn how to rave in our sleep!  All kidding aside,
I've actually jolted myself out of sleeping once when I started
to dream about raving and jerked my body.

No one's reported on Creation yet, so I will.

As advertised it was held at Raging Waters in San Jose, from 10 to 7pm
on Saturday.  The waterslides were lots of fun, but maybe they drew
people away from the "picnic" area where the music was. Having sand
and grass to dance on was pretty nice, but there wasn't really sufficient
density to call it a rave until maybe 5:30 or 6.  Thomas and Carlos played
the last two sets (I think). I really enjoyed the salsa tunes, but it
took a return to techno to get several dozen more people to get up and dance.
Total crowd was maybe 300 in the course of the day.  The water sports were
fun and even the non-ravers were reasonably friendly.  But the staff of 
Raging Waters were more than a bit authoritarian; folks had to smuggle all
food and drink, even water.  But for that, I had a good time, and the water
slides were almost worth the admission.  It was more a day at the beach
with house music than a killer rave, but that suited me fine.  I wonder if
Creation lost their shirts, though.

Hey, I was there too. I forgot to complain about it.  Well they also
had crummy lights with only 2 strobe lights!!  Not very organized.  I had
trouble reading the map point and the guy giving it out doesn't know where
it is.  Also, I didn't see any cops around and if they were going to shut
it down, why would they leave.

Subject: SFR picnic/meeting/party


Hi dear Ravers,

After reading few responses to the very appropriate comment by TAXI
(I don't think I ever meet you, have I??) I like to add my point of view.

I've been raving more and more in the last month like most of the people 
from the list that I know. I've been enjoying dancing and meeting lots of 
new friends (even if sometime the actual communication with them is 
superficial: it could just be my fault) but sometimes a question comes to 
my mind.

	What can I expect from the next rave?? 

I mean the last raves I've been to were excellent (few GG raves, Aborigine, 
Hyperdelic ToonTown, Waldo, Midnight Fest, LFR) and its hard to imagine how a 
future rave could be significantly better.

The only way to keep the scene alive and enjoyable is to discover new ways
of interaction with new friends: this is what the rave scene is all about,
isn't it?.
What I mean is we should try to keep this mailing list running and keep 
exchanging musical/social comments and Brian's idea of expanding the list is 
definely the way to go. 

We should also try to get together more often but not just to go to a rave.
When was the last time that you went to see a movie or a concert in a regural
club?? Long time ago for me.

So I think we should have a SFR picnic/meeting/party or whatever soon, so
we can discuss in person about all these interesting arguments
(music/drugs/sleep/friends/dancing): may be next weekend in GG park
regardless if there is a rave or not.
If we decide to meet we should do it at a more realistic time: something 
like 4PM.
Marx Meadow is a good meeting point because we all know where is it and
probably this time will be easier to find each others.
(last Sunday some of us meet by one of the two tables on the left of the 
sound system (facing the DJ)).

So friends speak up if you are up for Sunday (you can e-mail me if you
don't want to overload the list).

May be I'll see ya at COME/UNITY (I haven't decided yet if I'm going:
I'm reading all these interesting theories about sleeping but my body
has to get some serious sleep or I will never recover from the weekend)

Peace Love and Rave On

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello ravers,

I came upon a realization on Saturday night about the rave scene.
It's surprising it took me 6 months to figure this out.  I don't
really know about sfravers because I've only met a few but I was
hanging around the hard-core SF rave crowd.  So what I'm talking about
is really the hard-core SF rave crowd.  

The idea I want to put forth is that I believe there are massive
amounts of denial going on.  Specifically there is denial on 3
different levels that I've noticed.  Since I started raving, I slowly
got immersed in it to the point of becoming a hard-core raver.  Every
single hard-core raver I know has lost a lot of weight due to drugs
and raving.

I even know one guy who has landed in the hospital twice due to
exhaustion.  You can almost see his bones beneath his skin.  Also,
since I started raving, all of my hard-core raving friends have been taking
larger doses and more often as the months went by.  I was doing this
too and thinking nothing of it since everyone else was too.  I was
ignoring the fact that most of them look emaciated and that they have
lines (wrinkles) on their faces even though they are in their
twenties.  Some of the really long-time transplanted British ravers
look a decade older than their real age, in my opinion.  I was worried
that I had lost 23 pounds but I didn't stress about it.  

On Saturday I went to Let Freedom Rave.  At around
5am, I noticed the stress on the body from raving in almost everybody's
faces.  Just imagine this combination:  strenuous exercise (dancing)
for 5 or 6 hours straight,  severe dehydration due to both dancing and
drugs,  lack of sleep, lack of minerals and vitamins and an
electrolyte imbalance, lack of calories to support a night's worth of
dancing, and worst of all, the damage of drugs.
Everybody looked pale, tired, and just sick.  I went home and looked
in the mirror and I looked pale also and then I took a shower and
clumps of hair started falling out and I GOT REALLY SCARED for the first time. 
That's when I realized that raving does big damage to your body.  It
really stresses it.  Combined with drugs, the damage, in my opinion is
pretty severe.  So the first point I want to mention is the fact that
massive denial is going on within the hard-core raver scene that their
bodies will not stand up to continual abuse.  I've mentioned this to a
few of my raver friends and even though they agree, it doesn't seem
like they really are believing it.  Maybe it will take a death or
someone getting a permanent acid spaz out before they REALLY realize
the dangers.  (By the way as an aside, I've heard that E collapses the
micro-arteries in your brain and for males, also in their "areas".  I
don't know if that's true or not but that's what I've heard.)

The second point of denial, in my opinion, is the friendliness,
openness, brotherly and sisterly love that everyone seems to have.  A
lot of it is drug induced.  I personally love this openness that is
attached with the SF rave scene but I wish people could be like this
without taking e, acid, pot, shrooms, or what-have-you.  If everyone
accepted this friendliness and energy in the rave scene as drug 
induced and not real, then it might not be denial.  It might also be
funner if people were sober yet just as open and friendly.

The third point is one that doesn't apply to a lot a ravers, I think
but it does apply to most of my hard-core raver friends.  I noticed
that coincidentally, most of them are dealing with a deep
personal problem of some kind or another.  Many are unknowingly
escaping from their problem(s) by taking drugs while raving.  Many, in
my opinion, don't even know that they are taking drugs for this
reason.  Many think that they are taking drugs just to be friendly and
open while raving when deep, deep down they are actually trying to
deal with/escape from psychological hurt or anger or insecurity or a
desperate financial situation or a desperate personal situation or
whatever else.  Thus they are denying that raving is actually
an escape from a personal problem rather than a collection of very
friendly people who want to dance and have a good time. 

What are your comments on this?  Anyone else have any other
observations, disagreements?  I still will probably be part of the
rave scene but from now on, I am probably going to be drug free and
really take care of my body and be just as open and friendly.

Desi, before I reply to your reply, I believe it's important for you to read my
original posting called "Healthy raving vs. Drugs & Denial" which hasn't made
it to the mailing list yet.  Please do not reply to my quotes taken out of
context.  Do not reply to Vitamin B's reply to my post, reply to my original
post because you will read some stuff in there that Brian did not quote.

Now to answer your question.  What is a permanent acid spaz out?  Almost all
heavy users of acid have heard about this.  No, I do not believe the lies the
partnership for a truth-free america feeds me.  I go by what friends tell me. 
I have heard so many stories of this but I'll tell you one.  If you don't
beleive me then ask some other heavy users at Community tonite, ok?  Desi, I
believe ignorance is bliss.  Maybe I can teach you something here.  Acid users
have this expression for a hit of acid that causes you to go crazy permanently
but I can't remember what it's called.  Anyway, you can be a regular acid user
and you could be taking it for months or years and then one day, you take one
and you flip out permanently.  Let me tell you a story my roommate told me. 
She said that she used to take acid with 3 friends regularly and enjoy their
high and just relax.  They had been doing this for a few months.  On one
occasion one of the three guys left the room early and went home or something. 
They didn't think anything of it.  My roommate moved a week later to Florida
and didn't see her friends again until she moved back two years later. 
That's when she found out that the guy who had left the room early that day had
actually flipped out permanently.  She visited him in a mental institution and
she said he could hardly even talk.  She said he talked really slowly and
basically couldn't react to anything in the real world.  He's been in an
institution ever since.  By the way, the acid that that this guy took was
from the same batch that the other three friends had taken that night also.

Ok, I'll tell you another story.  This IS about the sf rave scene.  There is
this young woman, I'm not going to tell you her name, who flipped out on acid
for at least 3 months.  I don't actually know if she is back to normal now but
her raver friends took care of her while she was gone.  I've seen her talk to
people so I think she's ok now.  While she was "gone" I saw her trying shouting
at a dog for not eating a piece of bread she was trying to force feed it.  I
also saw her at a full moon rave asking some guys if they wanted to eat her
lighter.  Desi, just ask around the regular users and you will hear as many
stories as I've heard.  I'm not trying to scare you - I'm trying to inform you.

Desi, I'm not trying to 'convert' you in any way.  I'm a libertarian.  I think
that people should be allowed to do anything they want.  I don't have a concept
of "bad things" vs. "good things" except for theft and harming others.  I
believe one should be able to harm oneself as much as one wants. What I'm doing
is informing you of the risks.

I was talking to a female friend of mine at a rave (Toon Town in SF) a few 
weeks ago.  She didn't seem to be having an incredibly great time.  She said
she was awful uncomfortable because there were too many guys there who were
inexperienced x-ers and who were just a bit too touchy-feely.  She said that
a fair number of people have trouble handling ecstasy so that they don't bother
others.

And going on a different tangent, someone posted something interesting
to sfraves....

More utter nonsense.  If you want people to take you seriously
when you lecture them on the dangers of psychedelics, you'd better
stop lying to them.  Hysteria will get you about as far with me as
the PDFA got.

Acid, particularly in high doses, shouldn't be used frivolously.
People in fragile mental states might be tipped over the edge by
a bad acid experience.  Most users will *not* suddenly go insane.
Bad trips are stressful, yes.  Proper attention to set & setting
can minimize the danger.  People who use acid sensibly can trip
happily for years, with no harm done.

Some sensible guidelines for drug use, which apply whether
that drug is alcohol, pot, X, or acid:

- Know the substance.  
  Understand its effects.  Understand its side-effects.  **Don't
  rely on what your friends tell you.  Do some research yourself.**

- Know your limits.
  Think before you take a dose that's much larger than anything
  you've done before.
  
- Pay attention to set & setting with psychedelics.
  Keep your attitude positive & your surroundings supportive.
  If you've been having a bad time recently, postpone that trip.
  If your environment makes you uncomfortable, postpone that trip.

- Respect your body.  Take care of it.
  Eat right, take vitamins, exercise. Be careful if you're taking
  a lot of appetite suppressants like MDMA.

- All things in moderation.

  By the way, did anybody know the two gals who were sitting on our table

 were just some ravers who wanted to rest for awhile, not anybody with

 I definitely plan to be at another one someday, although the commute

All this stuff has been quoted so many times that I won't even try

Not only that, but what about the 'morning woody' that many/most men

>yes it does take a bit to adjust to a new schedule, but had
>we all grown up sleeping during the day and staying awake at night
>then thats what the natural schedule would be

Guess again: I'm a professional shift worker and take my word for it,
you never adjust.  I frequently miss raves (in fact, I miss MOST raves)
because I'm AT WORK!  Consequently I tend to not rave all that late
cuz being up all night is just not fun anymore.

Being up all night surrounded by pounding music and moving people
is different than staying up all night to do 'normal' living
functions like working.  First of all, less activity to keep you up.
Also, you HAVE TO stay up.  When raving you stay up all night when
you feel up to it.  Most people 'stay up all night' to 5 or 6 in the
morning so you can go to be before it's too light and you can fool
your body.  I did this all the time in grad school.  Also, you have
the option to crash earlier if you do get tired.

Just try and stay up to 9 AM, 10 AM, or even noon, then go to
sleep and get up before 11 PM and go to work again and not crash
early.  Do this for seven days straight.  It's easy for a couple of
days, but its impossible for most to make this regular.
It ends up that it doesn't
matter whether you get 2 or 10 hours sleep because you don't really
sleep.  After a 7 day stretch of this I have no problem going back
to 'normal' hours the very next day.

>your body is NOT hungry at the wrong time, it is hungry at the
>exact same time it would be if you were anywhere in the world

Even after 7 days of graveyard shift I still get sick to my stomach
whenever I eat anything substantial at night.  I usually eat breakfast
before I go to bed and breakfast again before I go to work and just
snack a little bit all night.  This causes me to lose weight.
(could THIS be the source of raver weight loss?  Call Jenny!)

Even I'll agree with this, but the fact is that we (person-kind) have
been living this way for so long that our metabolism now depends on it.

Staying up all night all the time has adverse health effects.  Many of
my co-workers who have been doing this for years are mood unics -
like a coke burn out.  I'm not suggesting that you don't rave
all night.  Just say know and make your own choices (as with
X, LSD, THC, etc.).

Subject: looking for Nervous Acid

Hello to everyone I met at the first picnic.  It was a doubleplusgood
experience and I am looking forward to the next one.  While we were out
groovin' in the woods I totally fell in love (platonically) with this
cool tune entitled "Nervous Acid" by someone whose last name begins with
a 'C'.  I would greatly appreciate some information on where I can aquire
this song.  If I cannot obtain this song it will severly disrupt my world-
conquest agenda.  Helping me find this song will be looked on very favorably
by the administration.

Just to put a note of calm into this current thread:

everyone who is interested could go get a copy of the alt.drugs
FAQ on Acid and read it before arguing further on this.  While
(obviously) not the absolute medical authority on the subject,
this FAQ is a very thourough and very well referenced piece of work
with references from established medical literature as well as
alternative press and the pro-hallucinogenic side.

It is available through alt.drugs or by ftp'ing to u.washington.edu
[128.95.136.1] in /public/alt.drugs or jyu.fi [130.234.0.1] in
/pub/alt.drugs.  It goes a long way in providing a level-headed
introduction to acid and debunks many a myth along the way.

Above all, be an informed consumer.

This, I believe, is the *greatest danger* of X, the one that the nutball right
wingers would never think to tell you.  One that goes beyond a little sleep
deprivation or vitamin deficiency.

I myself spent *most of the 80's* in precisely this situation.  In retrospect, 
yes, I learned some things, but on the other hand, I really wish I had those
years back.  That time is really my greatest personal loss.

Now, I'm sure lots of you will find many and various ways to flame me about
this, but, when one can look back on a significant chunk of what should have
been one's most productive/creative years, shot, zapped, gone, and never coming
back, there's a significance to that that goes beyond the trivial, or the
endless stream of ridiculous scare tactics.

And no, I really don't want to go into details on this forum.

No, it's not really put too strongly.  That's very accurate.

Be careful.  Don't form your relationships in the heat of an X-induced haze.
Form your relationships *first*.  Understand what's really valuable.

This is getting completely away from raves (please, please push "d" now),
but when I'm very tired and in a boring situation (like school, or driving
long distances) I find I lapse into REM sleep _seemlessly_ from being awake. 
It's very amusing: I'll be paying attention to whatever's going on, (the
teacher, the road), and then all of the sudden my mind will wander off and
make COMPLETELY hilarious tangents and free-associations. If I wasn't so
tired and scared of crashing the car or falling asleep in class I might
really enjoy it.  I usually don't have very lucid dreams, but these are just
incredible....

Subject: An Opinion on Drugs

So I was all set to chew out TAXI about his diatribe about drugs and
denial when the "original" version showed up. This one showed a lot
more understanding and less hasty accusation than the other version,
so I will not respond to the first.

About "spazzing":

This happened to someone I know. They took acid, after having taken it
many times before, and they just never stopped having hallucinations/
interconnectedness things until they had been committed to a mental
institution and treated with severe drugs.

Now let's ask some questions:

Was this the fault of the acid?
No, the person had a severe mental problem already. It's my uneducated
guess that the acid loosened things up enough that the problem took over.

Did the person think they were gonna flip out? Did they wanna?
Should they have taken the acid?
Most definitely not.

What could they have done to avoid spazzing?
Realized that they had a problem and that acid might let it get worse.

But was it their fault? Should they have known better?
I can't see how they could've. They didn't know their problem was that bad.

Acid is an expecially risky drug. It's like a gigantic rollercoaster
ride in your head. You can't escape until it's over. Some people like
rollercoasters. Some are deathly afraid of them. Some people think
they know what it's like, but they might not.

One more question: What should we, as ravers, do? Ban drugs?
No, we should help to spread understanding and inform people.

Nineball said it much more pithily than I, and I think we can all
agree:
"Above all, be an informed customer."

Many ravers do not take drugs. We have to spread that message, because
if we don't, we will attract too much police attention. Goodness
knows, Newsweek and Time are not our friends on this one. I am
currently writing to OUT magazine, a fairly cool gay/lez equivalent of
GQ or Esquire, to tell them that Rave is not exclusively an MDMA
party. They don't seem to know this yet.

Some people take drugs, but do not have a drug problem.
Some people do have a drug problem. Some might and not know it yet.

Let's concentrate on finding the problems and fixing them, not
spreading fear.

Most of the toxic effects of hard core drug abuse..particularly MDMA
only start to manifest themselves when higher than effective doses
are taken.(Or repeated)
For those who take catecholamine precursor amino acids (tyrosine,phenylalanine)
and anti-oxidants,the stress on the body may be reduced somewhat too.
Best rule of thumb. Moderation in all things,quality over quantity.

Subject: Re: Healthy Raving?

I have a fairly hard time with this idea of raving being bad for you.  I run
5K's and consistently place in the top five of my age group.  I am practically
the only person I know who has enough endurance to dance for seven hours
straight, let alone DJ for that length of time.  I've frequently gone to a
club when it opens and never left the dance floor until it closes (of course
this depends on how good the DJ is).  I do crash hard after a rave, or club,
or whatever that keeps me up all night.  So does this look like it is
unhealthy?

I don't do drugs either, but I don't condemn them at the same time.  I don't
know anyone personally who has ruined their life because of drugs and I think
that alchohol and smoking are far more insidious habits because they are
endorsed and pushed by the government and corporate America.  I've had so many
people give me baffled looks when I tell them I have never done drugs.  One
guy told me that he couldn't understand how I could play such good techno and
have never done any acid.  What that means, I'll never know.  However, being
able to drive yourself into an adrenaline high/trance from dancing and music is
an addiction of its own.

So I don't think raving is unhealthy in a generlized case.  Maybe for the
majority, but there are a few of us who are absolutely thriving on the scene.

This is the latest newsletter that I sent out.  I am a tee shirt designer
and I have my own little "company" called rEact candyloop raveskoolwear.
Read the following letter, and if you are interested, e-mail me and I
will put you on my mailing list.  Thanx for your time......

-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- 
                    Designs for the Discriminating Raver



Hello Hello Hello!

	It is great to be back.  I have *finally* got everything together and
the shirt business is being started up again.  After the last ones (Altern8 and
Orbital), I vowed to find a new silkscreener.  Well, I have.  And now I am set
to make the designs which have been nagging at me for quite some time.

What Happened
-------------

	An old friend of mine from back home in Oil City, PA (Ryan) had been
living in Pittsburgh for some time.  We just hadn't "connected" because we
were never around each other and *rarely* saw each other.  One night I went
to see FIST OF THE NORTH STAR (a *great* violent cartoon), and he happened to
be there.  We talked for about 5 minutes and I mentioned to him that I wanted
to do some silkscreening and I needed him as my artist.  I'll mention right 
now that Ryan is one of the best artists I have ever seen.  He has a good
sense of style, and he can do the things that I imagine being on the front
of a t-shirt.  Anyway, he thought the idea sounded good, and we vowed to keep
in touch.  Well, as things go, his phone malfunctioned (it *still* doesnt
work).  I couldn't get in touch with him.  A week later, I was walking back
to my apartment after getting off of work, and by chance Ryan had just
parked his car in front of the building.  We talked for a long time and he
came in.  I showed him all of old designs (Vicks, Jesus Raves, Moby, etc).
He was impressed and he said that he wanted to get involved in this project.
The reason he had parked out front was because he was planning on going job
hunting around the local business'.  We walked around for awhile and stopped
in a few places, but no one was really hiring.  Afterwards, we came back to
me place and pulled out the Donnelly Directory.  We called a bunch of 
different places (gas stations, warehouses, etc.), but no one was hiring 
there either.  FLASH OF INSIGHT.  I thumb to the "SilkScreener's" section
and prompt Ryan to call some of the places listed.  Lo and Behold, Ryan
is employed in about 30 minutes at a local silkscreener.  Everything came
together.

The Present        
-----------

	What all that means is : 
a) I now have almost *full* control over coloring.  No more flat yellow
   when I ask for bright yellow.
b) I have absolutely *full* control over shirt type.  No more 50/50.         
c) I have an artist who can breathe "life" into my ideas.  I won't have
   to rely on the abilities of PageMaker.  I can get drawings of cartoon
   people done, I can duplicate toy, candy and techno artist logos, etc.

	What this doesn't mean :
a) No drastic price change.  Though Ryan works there, we still have to pay
   full price for screening.  We just have more control over what is done.
b) I *still* can't have shirts done within 2 days (though I wish I could).
   We have to wait like other employees, but we can "bump" ours up a little
   at a time.  I am predicting about 1 week of wait per design.

The Reviews
-----------

	Here are what some really cool people have to say about my previous
two designs (Altern8 and Orbital).  Note : I was content with one but very
unhappy with the other

James Word
----------
Get another silk-screener.  One who won't give you a 50/50
mix when you say 100% Cotton.  That is my main beef.  Also,
the image wasnt as sharp as I had hoped, but the design was
good.  

Keith Resch
-----------
Dope shit man!  I am so stoked with the design and all!  Good stuff
maynard.  
If you pump out some more shirts like ALTERN8 I'm definately a
customer!@

Andy Crosby
-----------
altern8 shirt... looks pretty damn hip.

Pete Ashdown
------------
You're being way too hard on yourself.  The shirts are great!  Thanks for some
good work.  

John P. Turpin
--------------
The Orbital Tshirt is great. I have made alot of people here at work 
jealous. 

Mr. SparklE
---------------
Just a superbelatedly note to let you know the Altern8 shirt was dope shit
and many were impressed. I agree that it would've been coolasfuck to have
it bright yellow but good enuff for my tastes. 



The Designs Now-a-days
----------------------
	Well, as some of you may already know, I have already whipped up a
design that is being sent to press this week!  It is an original REACT design.
After going down to DC for the Future Rave, and seeing all the Jive, Sjobek,
Clobber, 26 Red, Drawls and 555-Soul stuff, I decided that I could do a good
job making ravey stuff (I have wanted to ever since I got my Jive TIDE shirt
back during X-mas).  Here is what my first rEaction looks like:

Color : Black (Fruit-of-the-Loom guaranteed)
Size  : XXL (if you need XL, e-mail me)

Front Design : The word "React" in detergent box lettering (a cool red)
               Underneath in smaller words, "CANDY COATINGS" (subdued orange)
               Around the design, 3 stylized (like Orbital) ovals (light blue)
                 that make the whole thing "atomic" looking
               "React" and "CANDY COATINGS" are surrounded by white (like a
                 box of detergent)

Back : A picture of a blue M&M man (an "r" instead of an "m" on his belly)
       One of his hands holds a red ball.
       The other is raised above his head in a fist and is surrounded by
         small stylized ovals (orange)

Summary : 4 color design on front / 4 color design on back

I am selling this shirt cheaper than my others.  Why?  It is my introductory
rEact design, and I just want to get an impression (ie reviews).

Price : $10 ($3 S & H   The Post Office charged me $3 to send the last ones)

More News
---------
	I had originally intended to make a couple of shirts for me and my
friends.  But after I mentioned the shirt to some people on IRC, I got a
good response.  So, I am selling them through the net.  If you are interested
in picking up one of these "extremeley hard to find" shirts (you won't see
anyone else sporting them at raves!), e-mail me and let me know.  You can either
wait until they are done (at which point I will promptly post a review), or
you can advance order one.  If you want a different color or size, let me 
know and I will do the best I can to get it for you.  BTW, I will be making
the MOBY shirt *very* soon after this (I know I said it before, but now I
have a better silkscreener).  I will send out another newsletter when this
is done.

Extra
-----
	Remember, if anyone else out there ahs any ideas about designs and
stuff, e-mail me and let me know.  I am always looking for phresh ideas.

I've been a total net spider, doing nothing but tapping the keyboard,
& I've been a workout-aholic, lifting running & other things > 5 hrs a
day.  When I'm couching, I can get by on ~5 hrs/nite sleep
indefinitely.  In fact I sleep rather poorly then & often get less.
When I'm exercising heavily, I need a LOT more sleep.  8 hrs a nite is
not enuf sometimes.  Maybe the body needs more repair time.  [I know
other people have had different experiences, our bodies are not all
designed by the same engineering team.]

Dancing semi-aerobically for 4+ hrs is a tremendous workout.  You could
need the usual things athletes need, carbos, lots & lots of water,
electrolyte replacement, extra rest, & so forth.  Take two of these
& call me in the morning.

Sometimes after a semester has ended and before finals have ended (we have
3-4 weeks of this), I have found myself working late doing computer stuff
and consistently going to sleep around 8am and waking up at 4pm.  I sleep
okay and don't feel like crashing early (in fact, it's hard to move onto
a normal schedule without a change of scenery) -- I just close the shades
when I go to sleep.  I also eat less, but that's probably because I'm not
getting any exercise.  The only problem with this kind of schedule is that
it makes me uncomfortable psychologically (there's just something **wrong**
psychologically with going to sleep after it's light), plus I'm out of
sync with everyone else.

Actually I think this is fairly normal ...  I've heard reports of experiments
done where they holed up a bunch of people in artificial light, took away all
clocks, had them do some sort of sedentary work, and let them eat and sleep
when they wanted.  The people ended up all moving onto a 36-hour schedule
(work 24 hours, sleep 12 hours).  This jives with personal experience ...

But if you're doing tiring physical work all day, like our ancestors did,
you move very naturally onto a 24-hour, early-to-bed/early-to-rise schedule.

i'm not going to flame you, but i might gently suggest that you are
using the drugs as a crutch.  i don't know the details of your
situation, but i wasted plenty of years on a stupid doomed
relationship that if i had any brains at all i would have terminated
long before it died on its own.  and it had absolutely nothing to do
with drugs.  i look back and say, "fuck!  three years down the
toilet!" but what are you going to do?  you can't live in the past.
the rent is too high, for one thing.

PHILOSOPHY MODE ON:

the point is that people are idiots, but nobody likes to admit that
they're an idiot.  they like to blame their stupidity on other things.
i include myself in this condemnation.  in the relationship mentioned
above, i exercised incredibly poor judgement because i wanted to
continue to get laid.  this is always a bad thing.  despite this
supposed "learning experience," if I found myself in similar
circumstances, I'd probably act exactly the same way.  cynical?  you
bet i am.  however i prefer to think of it as confronting reality.
blaming a pill for your problems is the coward's way out.  i said it
before and i'll say it again (d-d-d-dance while the record spins...
oops, sorry, slipped into techno mode there...): drugs don't turn
people into morons.

and a whole bunch of other really good stuff that i totally agree

my opinion is that people should learn to take responsibility for
their actions.  i have never ever been shown a case where you could
conclusively say "drug X is the *direct cause* of this problem."
where drug X is a recreational pharmaceutical along the lines of dope,
acid, or ecstasy.  the potential for fucking up majorly is inherent in
every one of us.  it's what makes us human, bless our miserable souls.
it's up to us to come to grips with our own stupidity and learn how to
handle it.  look yourself in the mirror and say, "i'm a loser.  i
don't deserve a daily supply of oxygen."  then get over it.

I lost track of who said this.
yeah, I've always found that spending four

at the television, not answering the

a big reason I subscribe to this list is
to get me out of the house and to a computer.

re:  permanent acid spaz.
I've heard LOTS of stories, which have
been completely undocumented.
I guess I'm a bit of a stickler for
documentation.

especially since I came to in the hospital
after having been taken there against my
will when I was under the influence of lsd.
so it was a twenty-four hour "spaz", which happened
two years ago, and I haven't tripped since.

when you get to the brink, just don't go
over it unless you want to.

I've been tripping for 13 years ( except the
past two ) and I keep hearing stories about
permanent acid spazzes, and I've yet to see one.

anyway, I guess it's waspy society that decides whether
the "permanent acid spazzes" are happy/well-adjusted/
all that crap ?  who can say, if these people really
do exist, that they don't want to/should not be the
way they are ?  it reminds me of the discussion about
"the autism problem."  oh, we should make them more
like us so they'll be so happy like us yippee.  yes.
let's make them like us so they'll validate OUR way.
but I digress.

and, I'll echo what others have said --
who can be sure it was the acid that caused it ?

what does this have to do with raves ?
I don't know.  whatever.  sorry it's so long.
I got carried away.  I can't wait to count the
number of requests for "calendar only please"
that follow this discussion.  Brian, you ought
to log some stats on what discussion prompts
the most requests for calendar only, and award
a prize to the person who contributed the most

I'd like to correct this:  I *am* not using drugs at all.  None.
And it's been that way for about 4 years now.  Clean as a whistle.

At the time (through the 80s), the relationship that I was in was, er,
less than ideal.  However, one of the things we did on occasion was
to sometimes use X as a self-administered "couples therapy."

If you know anything about the history of X, you also know that there
were psychiatrists who prescribed it to their patients in this way,
back when it was legal (which, by the way, was when I first used the
stuff).

Anyway, the upshot was that it made us feel better, but didn't *really*
fix anything.  You can't patch a cracked foundation.

X is a lot of fun.  X can be great to do with a loved one.  But it can
also be deceptive.  In our case, it did, in fact, prolong the relationship.

Yes, the relationship was broken.  I do not blame X for that.  What it
did was make it that much harder for us to *get out*.  Oh, it is also
worth noting that it was instrumental in forming the relationship in the
first place, by giving us warmer feelings towards one another than we'd
have had in the cold light of day.

That is the real danger.  And I know that I am not alone in having had
this experience.  Poo-poo this, if you like, rationalize my lost years
away, flame me, whatever ... I'm only saying this because I think that
knowing it *can* happen to you is important for everybody that plays
with this stuff.  I'm trying to help.  If it falls on deaf ears, so be
it.  I have no pulpit to pound.  It's your own life.

_Riding_the_rave_wave_



			Ravers play across the Bay


by Alfonso Ruiz
_Contributing_Writer_


	If you're "aving" these days it does not necessarily mean you're
insane -- you may just be following an increasingly popular underground dance
craze.
	"Raves," as they were dubbed by the British press in the country of 
their birth, are underground parties spread only by word of mouth, and have
become highly popular on both coasts of the United States, especially around
the Bay Area.
	As epitomized by the yellow happy-face that has come to symbolize the
rave, patrons cut loose and dance all night to a mix of techno-pop called
"house" music. Use of the drug ecstasy is commonly associated with the parties.
	The origins of the rave movement can be traced to England, where 
parties are said to have started in garages and empty warehouses in the mid to
early '80s.
	After their introduction to the United States, where the first non-
licensed underground raves were held in deserted buildings and aircraft 
hangers, they have grown to such size -- with some parties attracting nearly
2000 people at a time -- that it has become difficult for parties to remain
undetected by police.
	But the rave wave in America may also be coming above ground, as its
ever increasing appeal has caught the eye of licensed dance clubs, who hope
to legitimize the parties into money-making ventures.
	To avoid further police harrassment, some promoters of underground
raves are teaming up with licensed club owners to throw expensive, lavishly
produced parties.
	But not all ravers like the idea of commercializing their illegal
party scene.
	"It sucks that more and more raves have gone legit," said Mark 
Herlihy, a self-confessed rave junkie. "Now, they're more expensive and
not as much fun as when we dodged the cops."
	Also, some die-hard fans complain, some of the more commercial 
raves have lost the psychedelic love-in philosophy of the '60s that, along
with floppy hats and hip-hugging bell bottoms, have characterized raves from
early on.
	"Promoters making $25 a head aren't going to worry about all that
love stuff," Herlihy says.
	Raves have also been criticized by many people of color for not 
appealing to minorities, and efforts have been made to cater to people of
all ethnicities and sexual orientations.
	For example, Carefree, a predominantly gay rave, was held this past
weekend in San Francisco, which coincided with gay pride month and parade.
	And Liberation, a rave for people of color, occurred last Sunday in
Berkeley, as part of a benefit for a suicide victim.
	"I threw this (rave) so that anyone regardless of their race or
sexuality can come dance and be themselves," said organizer Carolina Ramos,
who also goes by the name of Chula Love.
	But raves are being forced to go legitimate for another reason. The
5-0, as police are called in underground-speak, are cracking down on suspected
rampant drug use by ravers.
	Allesandra Mori, who says she frequents at least two raves per 
weekend, estimates that at least half, if not more, of those in attendance
are on ecstasy or "X," or "Cid," the street name for acid.
	But Herlihy and Mori agree that even without police pressure, raves
will soon peak. With legitimate raves having to rent human gyroscopes, virtual
reality machines, velcro tumble walls and other side attractions, they may
soon be pricing themselves out of most patrons' budgets just to break even.
	"Raves are the disco of the '90s, people had fun disco-ing, just like
we're having fun raving. But we know it's bound to end sooner or later."


Two pictures: One of a DJ I've never seen before, smiling for the camera, and
it looks like he's DJ'ing from a living room; the other, a REALLY bad picture of
three torsos doing what could be dancing, dressed in standard yuppie club wear.
Ugh!!!!!!


I'll put this article in the FTP archives. With my comments, so people stumbling
into there won't think we actually agree with it :):)

congratulations.  what i originally meant to convey in the above quote

in reality the drugs were merely a convenient excuse for avoiding your
own shortcomings."

i realize you are doing this out of what you think are innocent
motives, but you are missing a huge logical fallacy.  how many times
do i have to reiterate this point: there's nothing special about
drugs.  they're completely neutral.  it's what you do with them that
matters.  like a hammer - you can use it to build a house or you can
use it to smash someone's brains in.

Well, I had a great time at Come-Unity.  It was neat meeting the large sfraves
contingent there... this is the first time I've met any of you in person and
it was great to connect faces to names on the list.  For those who couldn't 
make it, it was one of the better events I've been to.  The energy was there
from when we got there at 11:30 until we left at around 4:15.  It showed all
signs of going until 6 or 7...did anyone stay 'til the end?  At around one
o'clock the dj (sorry I didn't see who it was) started spinning some
incredible mixes.  The lights were good after 1-1:30 as well.  Gunther and
I were in just about the perfect state of mind for the event (BTW he says hi
to everyone too) and it seemed most other people there were too...  
	I don't think you would have had much problem getting in at 2, Brian...
I was in and out several times around 3 and it appeared that they weren't even
checking stamps/charging at the door around then...  I was hoping you would 
make it, since at one time there 8 or 9 sfravers there.  
	All in all, it was the best spent $5 ive had in a while.

p.s.  Mykl, Gian, Lee, Derek and Geoff:  We looked for you guys right before we left but didn't see you...hope you had a good time later on!

Also, congrats Jon on your 12" single...Gunther and I are musicians also and
appreciate how cool it must've been to hear your own stuff at a rave...

what about urban spelunking or games we make up ? 
we could make up our own game to suit the "rave" thing.
let's make a board game and sell it.
god knows there are enough people on this list who
are good with graphics.

or what about a scavenger hunt ?  it would be easy to pool our
ideas and come up with one.  I made up one before in Chicago, and
I didn't hear any complaints about it.  One person said "ophie, I
didn't realize you were *capable* of something like that" which
which is kind of an insult if you think about it.

I was planning to do a scavenger/treasure hunt this summer
anyway.  It's a great way to get free food.  go to taco bell
and tell them you need 6 packs of guacamole, BUT YOU CAN'T PAY FOR IT,
or it won't count in the scavenge.  I've spent endless hours amusing 
myself hunting and gathering this way.  but then some people think
I'm THE permanent acid spatzoid.

of course, there would have to be a prize involved.
certainly, at least, the winner's name would be posted
to the net.  we could probably come up with other 
electronic goodies if we thought about it.

what about a play ?  we could stage it for our own amusement.
I have friends who would come.  I've asked some people to help
me write it, and I definitely have a plot together, and would
welcome more ideas.

or we could organize an espionage club.
or make a video.
or discuss interesting books we're reading << I'm a librarian.

we could just make ourselves into the
ravers-algonquin-round-table-phenomenon.

Subject: Re: Healthy raving vs. drugs & denial 

  The ambient heat made me dissatisfied with my 3 page message and
destroy it.  Sigh.

  It isn't necessary for everyone to use drugs to learn openness.
Yet for many people it is one of the only ways they ever do it.

  I agree with much of what Taxi and Brian said.

  I wish, despite all that gets said, that there were more forms of
being open in this world as one is in a real rave.  How, I almost stop
caring; it's just that it happens.  This world can get in such an
emergency state of people not caring about friendship, that it stops
mattering how we open up after a point.  Our traditional method of
opening up and being friendly has transformed into just the opposite
-- most organized religions used to help people come together, and now
they only serve to seperate, oppress and prevent friendliness.
  There are many ways today that people are friendly to one another;
to many of us raves are one of those ways, and perhaps to some of us
one of the few ways available.
  However, time lets the corrupt seize power to the point where the
consumer must be aware enough to read inbetween the fine print to know
what products to use.  I don't think this means that all raves are
bad, nor all good.

  Everything sort of has to be taken on a case-by-case basis.  While
Taxi is right about a lot of his denial points, I don't want people to
go into denial about how good raves can be.

  Read Taxi's message, learn grow and don't leave.

  Am I going crazy?

X *magnifies* sex.  X is strong.  Sex is strong.  X+sex is that much stronger.

> do you see the error yet?

Look, you don't know the whole story.  I'm not going to talk about it here.
But don't tell me that I have an erroneous understanding of my own life.
I'm 35.  I think about my mistakes and failures.  I've seen and done enough
different things.  I am not naive about drugs.  And neither was she.

I am not "ranting against X", any more than I would rant against sex.  Yes,
they are similar, as you point out.  And I'm sure you would agree that sex
is something to be used responsibly.

What I am doing is saying that when you fiddle with this stuff, you are
fiddling with something a lot more powerful than it seems, so know the
pitfalls, and be careful.  This particular sort of thing is a pitfall.
Know it's there.

What I am saying is the X equivalent to the old A warnings about "set and
setting."  X seems very innocuous at the time, so you might think that
there are no particular caveats beyond those about vitamins and so forth.

My point is that an equivalent caveat on X use (like sex use), is that
you're less in danger if you already have a solid relationship with the
other, before you do this.  Kicking off a relationship this way is not
smart.  Using is for "couples therapy" is similarly questionable.
Sometimes the best thing is to know when to quit.  X urges you to hang on.

Subject: Re: drugs and raves 

I'd like to respond to a few points Puccio made, expanding on some
concepts and disagreeing with others in ways I find important.  I
ramble about here and there, dipping into politics and my life on
occasion, but it basically centers around the few points.


" X is a lot of fun.  X can be great to do with a loved one.  But it
" can also be deceptive.  In our case, it did, in fact, prolong the
" relationship [for the worse I presume you're saying].

If one knows of what X can do before one uses it, than its
deceptiveness can be much less.  I think this goes for all drugs: they
change reality.  What is worse is that there are many things in life
(besides drugs) that are deceptive, and yet many people like to
pinpoint all drugs as being deceptive, when really it is the people's
ignorance of what the drugs do and a general lack of psychological
principles that cause the deceptiveness, and furthermore with non-drug
things too (such as legal policies, advertisements, some religions,
various cultures, resulting relationship formats, etc.)  In fact, much
blame which should be placed elsewhere falls onto unknowing chemicals
who didn't themselves create much harm.

This is such a recurring phenomenon in society (placing blame on the
wrong thing).  Yesterday I walked past this transient yelling how he
won't vote for Barbara Boxer because she ``bounced a whole lot of
checks'' -- I wonder where he's getting his information from?  That
thing the House used for writing those checks >allowed< for what the
congressmembers did with it (and I dare say anyone not taking
advantage of what will help them without harm to others is in a way
harming others roundabout), so this guy turns around and blames one of
the people doing the most to help this country get out of its white
male dominance and corrupt power as being someone who is the root of
much evil based on misinformation about some fabricated ``check
writing scandal''.  This sort of misinformation thing goes on so often
it sometimes make me lose hope in life.


" >> [...] when one can look back on a significant chunk of
" >> what should have been one's most productive/creative years, shot,
" >> zapped, gone, and never coming back,

Taken out of context, the above makes me think of all the
opportunities I lost because of the traditional, outmoded school
system, and religious puritan values, as well as the myriad of
fundamentalists which didn't let me learn about my own sexuality
before my denial hurt me quite hard; and of course greedy corporations
(goes without saying).

Thank god there's life after 25 -- be it a blink -- so I can at least
try to pick up the pieces.

One of the results of my being a very `pure' youth is that I stayed
entirely away from many forms of exorbitant indulgence, such as drugs,
before.  These days while I'm still quite informed and aware of what
I'm doing, I've noticed many trends in me which are rebelling against
the previously over-careful years beyond the point of healthy healing
and into the realm of dangerous (e.g. driving, not working, standing
too near subway tracks, trusting drivers as I cross the street.)

" If you know anything about the history of X, you also know that there
" were psychiatrists who prescribed it to their patients in this way,
" back when it was legal [...]

The idea of psychiatrists using drugs to fix people has always
bothered me:  I think it's an easy way out for the psychiatrist to
`fix' someone; whether it succeeds or just manages in hiding the
problems the person is having, it still seems rather unethical in my
opinion to suggest drugs when a good mental psychologist can work out
the problems right.  Unfortunately, there aren't many good
psychologists out there, and drugs indeed have been found which affect
some good results, despite the potentially less thorough means.  I
don't know this all for a fact, but this is how I've felt ever since I
understood what psychiatrists do as much as I do.  I've always
resisted being given psychiatric drugs, and always opted for
psychologists; although it took damn too long for me to figure out how
to find the right psychologist, I preferred the good one I found to the
thought of taking drugs.  Looking back, perhaps just taking the right
drugs early on would have saved a lot of trouble ... one never really knows.

" You can't patch a cracked foundation.

I can!  The foundation won't be as strong, but it will be patched!
But rather than argue about the truthfulness of your analogy, it's
more important for me to realize what you're trying to say by it,
which I agree with entirely: It's better to replace or carefully
reconstruct it than prop it up precariously.

Phew. I was getting nervous there, especially when they did all that 
previewing. ("Coming up - it's the hippest, hottest new place for your

But it turned out not to be a bad segment. They interviewed real ravers, 
"Tony" the guy I guess responsible for putting on Gatherings, played a
little music (sorry Mike, no Twitch #3, I don't think), showed the site
during the day, showed the power supplying 28Kwatts, showed the lasers
and visuals, and in short came up with something that I bet my mom would
have even wanted to go to :)  They really played down the drug aspect; Tony
estimated that 75% of the attendees were getting high only on the music.
I didn't recognize any sfravers, and Graham wasn't interviewed :( but I
did see that guy with those annying "headlight" glasses (yes, glasses with
bright miniature headlights on the front. E-gad.)

Afterward they went live to a pharmalogical professor from UCSF and asked him
about MDMA, and the doctor basically came out and said the DEA acted hastefully
in making it a schedule (A? 1?) drug. Yea. When asked if it was addictive, he
said basically anything's addictive when used in excessive amounts. Doosh!

Subject: How not to have fun -- drugs and ranting


I know Jim Puccio very well. He is, to use a phrase, "a helluva human
being." He knows a helluva lot more about drugs, music, and art than most
of the people on this list put together.

Let me summarize his key points:
	- X is a more powerful drug than it appears
	- It can have a misleading effect, where you don't think it's
		affecting your life, but it is
	- It had this effect on him, and since he didn't know about the
		effect, he got messed up
	- Punchline: Know your drugs, be aware of the effects

So here comes all those Political Correctness Monsters, ranting and screaming.
Let's summarize what they have to say:
	- You can't claim that drugs messed up your life
	- (lots and lots and lots of irrelevant A=A ranting)
	- If Jim had known his drugs, he wouldna gotten messed up
	- Punchline: Know your drugs, be aware of the affects

Can we all see that we are all violently agreeing with each other here?

Read Jim's stuff again. He does not ever advocate that we outlaw
drugs, or even that people don't take drugs. He tells you about a
certain effect this certain drug has -- a subtle effect,
longer-lasting than 6 hours -- and warns you that this effect might
surprise you.

He gives you information -- not preaching. Use the information, or
ignore it -- at your own risk.

Not to sound like a 12-stepper, but Jim did do a very brave thing by
using his own example to elucidate. He admitted to his own personal
failure, and accepted responsibility for his own actions and choices.

You knee-jerk reactors, with your "you can have my drugs when you pry
them from my cold, dead fingers" attitude are not only overreacting,
but you are insulting a person much wiser than you.

Information is the most powerful drug on the planet. You reject some
wise, carefully explained data from a first-hand source, just because
your knee-jerk politics insist that you maintain your dogmatic
position that drugs don't kill people, people kill people. Well, boys
and girls, what I am telling you is that STUPIDITY KILLS PEOPLE far
more than drugs ever will.

To quote a friend: "Read. Learn. Evolve." Take the information offered
you (with a grain of salt, if you like), but realize that like the
morning piss after an all-night non-stop driving quest, it comes to
you straight from the source, steaming hot, highly concentrated and
purified over time.

well, if you've ever done ecstasy with a few close friends in a purely

things that you might normally be reluctant to talk about spill out

Was anybody else's car broken into during the Let Freedom Rave?  My trunk was
broken into and the thieves had no mercy with my trunk lock.  They actually
bent the metal of the trunk as well.  Nothing was stolen cause I didn't have
anything of value in there.

I also saw three young looking guys in their late teens,
non-raver looking, wearing really dirty clothes who were trying to drive a
green lincoln continental that I strongly suspect is a stolen vehicle.  I went
up to their car which was next to mine since I noticed one guy suspiciously
scoping the cars in the lot.  He was waiting for his 2 friends and when I
accosted their car, all three of them had this look of fear written on their
faces.  They looked like runaways.  They desperately tried to convince me that
the car was theirs and they succeeded until they took off.  As they were taking
off I realized that the drivier didn't even know how to change the gears of
this automatic car (with the shift located above the steering column).  My gut
feeling when I was talking to them was that they were lying through their
teeth.   Of course, I have no way of knowing for sure, and I do allow for the

It was my impression that MDMA was never approved for human consumption 
by the FDA, so it was never allowed to be prescribed.  Also, I don't think
psychiatrists have ever used MDMA to *treat* clients -- instead, they used 
MDMA as a tool for opening the emotions during psychoanalysis.  I'm sure 
many of you on this list have had a friend spill his or her entire life 
story while X-ing.  That behaviour is just what is needed for psychoanalysis
to be effective.

So, while MDMA was only recently added to Schedule A (the list of illegal 
drugs that includes marajuana, cocaine, LSD, PCP, heroin, etc.), it was 
never completely legal.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  I've also heard that MDMA was 
used in the early 1900's in Germany for appetite suppression (since it is
similar to speed).  I can't even picture that!  I would bet that this is not
factual, but it's fun to think about anyway!

I don't know whether this story is "true" or "false" but I do
recognize it as a cyclical news story, 1 that appears 
every so many years (~2?).  LSD has had more comebacks than Sinatra.

So I'm not sure that it's really "news".  Maybe it's
propaganda, or maybe it's fishing for sensationalism on
a slow news day.

Hi Giamma, I've been out of town all week, so I missed the Channel 5 report. 
How long was it?  Was it worth watching?  If it is, maybe I'd like to get a
copy (or watch yours) when I get back from Boston this weekend.

Sounds like I've missed a few good raves while I've been gone.  I was hoping to
catch a few raves in New York and Boston, but there's absolutely nothing
happening here.  Is there anything big happening on Saturday night?  I could
really use a good night of dancing.  If nothing special is going on, I'll
probably go to Care*free.  Talk to you soon,

Tim

Subject: The Fifth Column


Believe it or not, when I was in DC last November I went there... the club
itself has an absolutely incredible interior.  Several rooms... the main
room looks like a huge renovated ballroom with a high ceiling painted
cerulian blue with mouldings, raised carvings, etc... I went Halloween night
and they have two cages in the main room with go-go dancers doing some kind
of sex act thingey (maybe it was only for Halloween???).  Upstairs is
another bar... this room was so cool because the whole thing was
panelled with these shallow plastic columns filled with water and then
backlit blue, with bubbles rising up in them.  With several built-in
fishtanks, you felt like you were in a giant fishbowl.  The coolest
bar I've ever seen.  Downstairs there was another dancefloor with 
another DJ... the downstairs was decorated like a frescoed Mediterranean
house, complete with an outside "garden" with garden tables, chairs, and
hanging plants everywhere.

The only disappointing thing about the club was the music... in the main room
a kind of DV8 mix:  like George Michael stuff like that.  Downstairs was
perhaps more alternative:  a cross between house, industrial and the teaser
techno song... I think while I was down there the DJ played T99 or something
like that.

House club?  Maybe my friend and I went on the wrong night... but, if you
are in town, I do definitely recommend it if only for the decoration itself.
San Francisco has nothing like it.

EVERYONE should read the FAQ-Ecstasy from ftp.u.washington.edu
in public/alt.drugs
(or something like that)

before talking about ecstasy

but just to summarize some info and encourage the
'little knowledge is worse than no knowledge'
epidemic that there is about drugs

MDA was first made by Parke-Davis as an appetite suppressant in 1917
MDMA was first synthesized by E Merck & Co in Germany in 1914

Psychotherapists used MDMA as an aid in psycho-therapy because
'it has few negative side effects and can act to ease psychic
trauma and break down barriers to communicaton.'

They also say that it has a low potential for abuse because
the 'pleasant side effects' diminish with regular use

DEA stuff

July 1984- proposal for MDMA to be classified a Schedule 1 controlled substance

This proposal was defended by saying that MDA was shown in research
at U. of Chicago to be neurotoxic to seratonergic neurons in the brain
and although MDMA was not researched, it did affect seratonergic neurons
and it must be as bad as MDA

THEREFORE the clinics could not do research on MDMA itself
because of the Schedule 1 classification

almost all experiments with MDMA have been done on rats
and a few primates, human research is very limited

basically MDMA lowers the level of seratonin in your brain
(seratonin is the chemical that causes or is around 
when people are depressed)
this is a REVERSIBLE thing, so no worry
but it is also supposed to be neurotoxic, like the DEA _guessed_
there are lots of other things that you should personally research
and try to figure out and ask people before you take it

in 1987 the supreme court overturned the Schedule 1 classification
because of a challenge to the DEA's saying that MDMA has a high 
potential for abuse and also that the classification was based on
"incomplete and arbitrary recomendations from the Secretary of
Health and Human Services"

where it stands right now, i dont know
but there is a whole file that has tons of info

before you talk about it much less do it,
please read up about it

Subject: The History Thang

1.  X was 'legal' in the sense that no legislation yet existed regarding it.
The situation was very parallel to that of acid in the early 60's.  Those of us
that experimented with it (and MDA, which I liked better) at the time felt the
sort of excitement about these *amazing* things apparently slipping through the
cracks that the folks at Harvard must have felt while it lasted for them.

2.  Probably the word "prescribed" was an unfortunate choice, given how we net
hounds tend to dissect things to death.  There were psychiatrists that used
X as part of their practise.  Again, this is parallel to acid's clinical use
to treat alcoholism.  There was a fellow locally, here, by the name of Bob
Ingrasci (who was friends, I believe with Grinspoon of the excellent "...
Reconsidered" books) who did just that.

3.  I never have used a psychiatrist, so my information on these practices is
not first-hand.  I was very much *in* the X culture when the ruling came down,
and there was quite a brouhaha for a while, with Ingrasci and Grinspoon
spearheading the anti-prohibition info storm.  I think Ingrasci may have
finally had criminal charges pressed against him, and lost his practise.
I don't recall for sure, but I think that is how it went.  In the info storm
was a lot of stuff about clinical and therapeutic uses of X.  There were uses
within the clinical practise, and there were uses involving couples being left
alone to rediscover each other.  The latter was quite a bit more like "normal"
use of X, and I think is how they nailed Ingrasci's ass ultimately, if I in
fact recall the details of his case correctly.

In any case, these events are all a matter of history, and can be looked up.

I like the idea of the rally-rave in Sacto, but I think the timing is
perfectly wrong. If anything, it'll just piss off the lawmakers, --
"we've got important work to do with the budget, and these kids are
worrying about their right to party."

I was actually thinking that our next sfraves "rave" should be open to the
public and political in nature -- basically, put out the message for every
rave-kid to

	(1) VOTE -- we need to offset all the conservative muthafuckas
	who are going to be leading us down the road to fascism in the
	next decade. The rest of the country is not at all like you,
	me, our friends, etc -- and "they" will be more than happy to see
	our bones smouldering in the crematorium, see our women dieing of
	self-administered illegal abortions, see our freedom of expression
	stifled... anything to ensure that we continue to practice the
	deception and lies of our judeo-christian forefathers!

	(2) VOTE DEMOCRATIC -- not because of Clinton, but because 
	he's going to put more middle-of-the-road, pro-choice,
	less-openly-racist justices on the supreme court.

	(3) YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL. Don't give up hope just because
	everything is being run by shitheads. Vote for the lesser of two
	evils!

Don't get me wrong -- I think Clinton is complete Putz, but he's less of a
Putz than Bush or Perot. Better a Putz than Kinder and Gentler Fascist.

But then again, Clinton just chose Gore as his running mate. My biggest
problem with this is Gore's wife -- anybody remember Tipper Gore? Can you
say PMRC? Sure you can...

Gee, I wonder what's going to happen to freedom of expression with Tipper
pussy-whipping Al Gore and Clinton to ensure we all follow Christian mores?

Scuse me, gotta run. Time to puke.

PS: Anybody think this'll be a good bumper sticker? (And which direction
are swastikas supposed to go anyways?)

Tipper Gore is scary.  She, Barbara and Nancy would all get along real
well.  This is a good reason for me to withdraw my support for Clinton.
Anyone who would choose as a running mate someone who would marry someone as
messed up as Tipper Gore is questionable.

>PS: Anybody think this'll be a good bumper sticker? (And which direction
>are swastikas supposed to go anyways?)

Swastikas are associated with a very specific group of people (I am aware of
the earlier symbolisms of Swastikas, but that's not relevant to this).  Bush
does share some of the views of the Nazis:  He is in favor of restricting
our freedoms of thought and expression, and he favors policies which are
resulting in the slow genocide of peoples in America and abroad.  However,
he is not evil in the way the Nazis were because what he does is not
systematized, purposeful and industrialized.  It is also not of the same
magnitude (yes, you can quote me death stats from Iraq and other places, but
still, it's not the same).  It is inapropriate to use the Swastikas in this
context.  Bush is not truely evil in the way the Nazis were.  To connect
Bush with the Nazis is to make light of the Holocaust.  This is offensive to
many people, especially those whose ancestors died in the Holocaust.

Also, it is not correct to put Perot on the same level with Bush.  Perot is
pro-choice.  This is a major difference.  We know that Perot was a high-up
in the Republican Party at one point, but he has now abandonded it, perhaps
because he, too, disaproves of it.  In fact, the biggest problem with Perot
right now is that he hasn't taken stands on many real issues yet.  This is a
good reason not to connect him with a group as evil as the Nazi Party.
Again, to make an accusation like that lightly is to make light of the
Holocaust.

I am not a fan of Bush, but I was disturbed that, during the war in Iraq,
people in the protest movement were connecting him with Hitler.  I am
equally disturbed that Bush would make a connection between Hussein and
Hitler.  Using the horror of the Nazis as a rhetorical device is offensive.

It really is too bad I never met my grandather -- i woulda wanted to know
what his college buddy sigmund (as in Freud) was like.  <insert sound of

i personally feel like we're hitting 1927 all over again, and I'd like to
be able to tell my grandson stories about my crazed youth.

The conclusion I think people should take away is that the upcoming
election won't just move a couple into the whitehouse. it also empowers
many aligned staff members, and most importantly, it will ensure that we
won't get any more Supreme Court Justices like Souter or Thomas. These are
lifetime positions, and the make-up of the supreme court today is pretty
right-wing these days. I don't know how long the remaining non-rightists
are going to last, but if we don't get a democrat into the whitehouse this
time, we're history.

If you think the recent abortion ruling was bad (and the upcoming potential
overthrow of roe-vs-wade too), you won't believe how fast they be able to
burn the constitution once they've stacked the house....

Which is why I say -- RAVE ON and VOTE -- while you still can...

PS: Remeber that Bush used to work for the CIA -- a group that wrote the
book on murder, corruption, and genocide! Just ask yourself who was sitting
there while the october surprise, iran-contra, and S&L scandal transpired?
If genocide is your only guage to evil, well, Iraq was certainly genocide.
Actually, it was more like a business gesture to his oil buddies, but it
looked just like genocide from the wrong end of a bomb...

W/R/T Perot -- yes, we know almost nothing about him, but what we do know
is (for example) that he was certainly an asshole at EDS, w/ some Nazi-like
biz conduct... one day he says "no gays" ... and the next (realizing the
number of voters he just lost) say "gays ok".... talks libertarian, acts
like a fascist.  And ya gotta wonder about anybody that buys their own way
into the political system. Guess it's a good business investment, no?
BizNiss it's what makes amerikkka great, no?

So if you can think of a better pictogram for fascist than the swastika
(and all the evil that it implies), please draw one for me. Oh, and I just
checked -- 'grep' sez I never said "nazi" in my previous post...

I saw a pretty similar concept on a T-shirt at Gay Pride Day; the bodies
of the 3 candidates with symbols (including the swastika) superimposed
on Bush's & Perot's faces, while Clinton was given a halo.  In the spirit
of rave music, where music and sound sources are borrowed freely, and
the free sharing of information and expression is encouraged, I find
copyright notices to be a bummer.  Not a flame, just uh, uh, a point of
view.

Now on a lighter note:  Does everyone remember during the Mayoral race
when candidate Hongisto (before he transformed into a fascist pig) did
some politikking at a leather bar one evening?  I'm looking forward to
running into Bill or Al at a rave, maybe even Tipper (you know, so she
can 'prove' how open she *really* is)!

  As I understand it MDMA (then known as homarylamine) was patented in 1914
by the Merck co. as part of their patenting of all the molecules in that
family (3 carbon componds related to safrole...)
That's why it is now in the public domain, and so even if someone did
find a mainstream commercial use for it (not that they already havn't, if
you know what I mean...) it would not be able to be patented..hence
no financial impetus to go through the expensive IND process..

hi niels, ravers!
this is a bit off the rave tip, but interesting. i must agree with niels on
this one. there are some interesting parallels between the state of affairs
now and those described in 'friendly fascism', a book by bertram gross about
the face on totalitarain control in modern capitalism. things 'look' democratic
but are not. i mean, how many choices do we really have ? how difficult is it
to get a new party on ballots ? how difficult is it to vote ? ask yourself
why is it that so many people abstain from voting. us has one of the lowest
voter turnouts in industrialised world. maybe the voters know something, like
there is very little difference between the two candidates. perhaps the
demos are a bit better. no republican in the white house, tho'. maybe
no president.

	It is inapropriate to use the Swastikas in this
	context.  Bush is not truely evil in the way the Nazis were.  To connect
	Bush with the Nazis is to make light of the Holocaust.  This is offensive to
	many people, especially those whose ancestors died in the Holocaust.

	Also, it is not correct to put Perot on the same level with Bush.  Perot is
	pro-choice.  This is a major difference.  We know that Perot was a high-up
	in the Republican Party at one point, but he has now abandonded it, perhaps
	because he, too, disaproves of it.  In fact, the biggest problem with Perot
	right now is that he hasn't taken stands on many real issues yet.  This is a
	good reason not to connect him with a group as evil as the Nazi Party.
	Again, to make an accusation like that lightly is to make light of the
	Holocaust.

	I am not a fan of Bush, but I was disturbed that, during the war in Iraq,
	people in the protest movement were connecting him with Hitler.  I am
	equally disturbed that Bush would make a connection between Hussein and
	Hitler.  Using the horror of the Nazis as a rhetorical device is offensive.

	e

hh,
	I understand how you feel about this, what I want to say is that I've
	been reading about the "Nazis" and about Germany leaading up to the war
	and it is really scarey.  You see evil is very relative, Hitler did not
	come to power spouting anti-semitism left and right, he came to power talking
	about Christ, God and Country he "alluded" to the "problem" using code words
	that the German people "understood".  It wasn't untill he was firmly intrenched
	that he and the Nazis started to attack Jews and any other non-aryan group
	that lived in Germany.  The point that I want to make is that he and the German
	people DID NOT CONSIDER WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS EVIL no more than the average
	american considers bombing a civilian population in the middle east or supporting
	genocide in indonesia.  The German people knew about the ovens but they
	WERE IN DENIAL.  Also remember Hitler was ELECTED.

Subject: Ingrasci and the Law

For you detail freaks.  I've been prodding my memory, with some slight results.
The more I think about it, the more I think Ingrasci did get in hot water.
So, for anybody with a legal bent (law student, perhaps?), here are some clues:

* I think his name may have been Rick, not Bob.
* He may have got in trouble for 'unprofessional relations' with a patient.

Do I remember these tids for sure?  No, I would *not* stake my life on them.

Why does any of this matter?  It only does if you have an interest in the
political and legal shenanigans that went down when this family of chemicals
got scheduled.

This stuff was newsworthy at the time.  Whatever exactly happened to the guy
was covered in the news media.  That's where I saw it.

I would personally not care, except that

* He and Grinspoon were very outspoken, and I think both testified before
  congress (I am quite certain Grinspoon did).  It sticks in my mind because
  I had read and respected Grinspoon's books, and knew (though not very well)
  Grinspoon's son a few years earlier.  The quotes that were cited in the
  fragment of the X FAQ were *very* familiar from that time period, and may 
  well be quotes of one of these two fellows' congressional testimony.

* Ingrasci did have a psychotherapy practice in which he employed X 
  therapeutically, and I believe, "couples therapy" was specifically mentioned.

I may not be wise in the ways of the world (hell, I'm only 22), but I would
caution about being overly simplistic/idealistic about American politics.
Clinton is not the "sweetness and light" that some people think, nor are
Bush or Perot comparable to Nazis or Fascists.  Clinton is just the lesser
of the evils ...  Bush may be pretty bad, but he's not a mental case, like
Hitler or Reagan was; IMHO he's not to be feared in the same way. (he's just
letting our country rot slowly, rather than fast -- wonderful, ain't it?)

As for civilian genocide (which I agree is horrible), keep in mind that
we committed much worse atrocities in WWII and Vietnam, under FDR, Kennedy,
Johnson, and Nixon -- yet people didn't call them fascists or Nazis (not even
Nixon).

	Ever try a McDonald's Birthday Party?  Granted, not all McDonald's
managers would be that open to it, but the key is to prepay, if possible, and
to perhaps choose a branch that a friend/fellow raver is working at.  This
would ensure that the employee coordinating the party would be willing to

  Ulmo

	I don't think so.  I used to be a fundamentalist/evangelical Bible
thumper, but I gave that up when I came to the conclusion that the division
between theory (da Bible) and practice (Falwell et al.) was too great. 
Basically, I don't feel that the Christianity of 2,000 years ago has much to do
with contemporary Xian tradition.  The abortion issue is a case in point; the
entire "Biblical" case against abortion is based on very flimsy documentation:
a passage in Levitical law concerning injury to a pregnant mother (which may
not be relevant in post-Old Testament times), and a poetic reference in one of
David's Psalms.  I'd like to meet the shyster who convinced these people that
the anti-abortion position is biblical.
	I don't think that the Bible can be totally devalued (it's great for
use with film projectors to project the image higher on the wall, for one) but
I think that the valuable parts can also be found in other religious
traditions, and also combined with them as well.  Hey, brew your own religion! 
Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond did, and they're gettin' rich and famous.  What's
worse, I'm contributing to their mythos for FREE!
	What the Bible beaters often have, though, is a keen sense in how to
build community.  Take my word for it, you can make mighty good friends with
people on a church retreat.  What they lack, though, is an all-embracing
openness that would ultimately lead to further self-examination and greater
understanding between people of different heritage and philosophies.  If there
were just a group of people of all different races, creeds, sexual
orientations, etc. who decided to meet, say, once a week to discuss what was
really on their minds, the world would be a slightly better place.  (Oh yes,
any Bible thumpers who wanted to participate would also be welcome.)
	Just one more thing for you folks out in SF or NetLand:  I did send a
letter out to that organization in Tennessee that purports to be useful in
community building.  I'll let U know when I get a response.

ovid and niels,

i also agree that echoes of Bertram Gross' FRIENDLY FASCISM can be found in
our current political situation.  But wouldn't Gross argue that the
largely apolitical rave scene strengthens the friendly fascists?  Put 
yourself in their shoes.  If you were trying to maintain social control in
the midst of a triple dip recession{ , rising racial tension, and a 
shattered national consensus, what would frighten you more: politicized,
outspoken students rallying for political change or apolitical students
taking xtc or acid and dancing all night?

political activism and raving aren't *necessarily* mutually exclusive, but
there doesn't seem to be much of an interest in politics in the rave scene.

Graham wasn't actually interviewed on camera, but his conversation with the
reporter caused her to give the story a very positive slant.  The reporter
said to Graham that she hardly saw any drugs at the rave.  (In other words,
she didn't see any tripping people sprawled on the ground playing with their 
navels -- the classic 60s image of acid heads.)  Graham figured that he would
go along with that, rather than saying that lots of people were having positive
psychedelic experiences.  (Anyone who's seen someone try to defend drug use to
the media knows that the media will always make the person look like a complete
whacko.)  When the reporter asked Graham about the Info E flyers, he said that
he knew that *some* (very very very very few) people took E at raves, and he
thought that there was a need to provide a source of information about the
drug.

I'm really glad to see issues of community being discussed here.  I don't
have time to say much now, but I'd like to point out that the deadheads have
been dealing with similar issues [and similar drugs!] for years. I feel
there is already a parallel between the raver community and the deadheads,
and we can learn a great deal from how they have handled the same problems.
Walking down the street in raver clothes is "letting your freak flag fly"
and I am heartened to see poeple looking out for each other in our scene.  I
think we are on the right track here - we still need to make good decisions
and be aware of what we do, but we're off to a good start.

One other thing.  I don't remember seeing any reviews of Creation, and I
know it was a week ago, but I feel compelled to say what it was like.

The music was great, the weather was very nice, the slides were fun.
Unfortunately, there were a couple of SJPD guys going around and searching
backpacks.  There didnt seem to be any reason for them to go up to people,
nobody was freaking out or acting strangely, and furthermore, the waterpark
staff was inspecting backpacks on the way in [mostly looking for food, I
guess].  Anyway, it was VERY bad energy and creepy in the extreme!  I spent
most of my time there away from the party for that reason - avoiding the
cops [and no, I wasnt carrying anything - I just didnt want the hassle]
Even so, we were being monitored pretty closely out on the rides too -  we
all ahd these tyvek wristbands which got us into the picnic area and
conveniently marked us as FREAKS outside.  I know Joel didnt plan this
[gads!] but it may have something to do with why he's gotten hard to find
recently.  Anyway, the Gathering, where we went later, erased all the bad
energy and left us ready to rave on into the future!

I was a little bummed when I got to Townsend only to find out that the rave 
had been moved to 1015 Folsom.  When I got there, I saw a lot of hardcore
raver standing out in the street, apparently CU was 21+ and I was surprised to
find so many familiar faces to be under 21 (I guess Townsend is fairly lax)
But one friend of mine who is under 21 and ALWAYS gets in did indeed manage to 
get past the doorman.

This was the first rave where I had an "e" flashback!  The energy was so strong
that I was "on fire". At first I thought someone had dosed my water or something
but then I realized it was "all in the mind, yaknow".  Has this ever happened
to anyone else?  Anyway I left at 5 am, it was hard to leave with so many 
people raving as hard as they were last night.  This was a good last rave for me

Subject: replies to all w/r/t Raving/Politics/Fascism

i warn you, don't even think of reading this!!!

--------------------

I sorta think that raves should be more political -- I see enough
ecological undercurrents, flyers and information tables. Why not at least
try to VOTE for change?

W/r/t the notion that X and LSD are throwing the youth into blissful
disarray so that they cannot mount opposition against the government --
that's an old idea. It was claimed that the 60's psychedelic era was
inspired by a designed effort by the CIA to perform chemical warfare on the
populace. I think that's taking the conspiracy a bit too far, but anything
*is* possible. The CIA & the Military were experimenting with the shit, and
in fact, a good amount of it was done at the VA hospital in Menlo Park/Palo
Alto... I believe it "got out" through it's own "force of will" (yes,
psychoactive chemicals are a kind of virus-like life form!)...  not by
human design.

On the other hand, when the CIA started funding covert operations by
running heroin out of southeast asia, they certainly *DID* have a bad
effect on the slums in the US. (I'm oversimplifying things here... CIA
wasn't necessarily running heroin during the height of the problem, they
just created a market of addicts, then empowered golden-triangle warlords
into becoming armies/nations/corporations unto themselves, until the CIA
could no longer control the situation).

Anyways....

> Clinton is not the "sweetness and light" that some people think

I thought I made it clear that Cliton was the lesser of three evils, and
that the real battle is for the control of the supreme court.  I would have
preferred Brown myself, even though I think he's a flake -- but at least
his heart is in the right place. (I voted for Brown in the primary).  I
sometimes feel that Clinton is a talking haircut, but at least he says the
right things.

Maybe they were using ecstasy to prolong a relationship that never should
have been? :-) I don't think Tipper is good enough reason to vote for
pinheads like Perot or Bush....

Just goes to show you that when you think you have an original idea,
someone else has probably beaten you to it. I never saw the T-shirt before,
but if anybody knows where to purchase one, I'm interested in acquiring
one.

Samples may be borrowed freely, but if the song or group gains enough
popularity to hit the mainstream, you can be sure that the record producers
will be researching the sample sources and paying royalties to the original
authors. Otherwise, the record company will get their asses sued so hard
they won't know what hit them (remember that record companies have deep
pockets, while artists don't -- the more cash a record company has, the 
more thay have to cover their asses).

Anyways... my copyright is the next best thing to public domain, it just
ensures I get credit for my not-so-original idea.

Bill appeared on MTV, and came up with a very youth-positive message. Bush
refused to do so, and we'll see about Perot (i doubt it).

Geoff, you hit the nail right through the saviours hand! I'm seeing the
same sort of posturing and secret-code-communications going on w/ Bush and
Perot right now. Take "family values" for example... Or "democracy" as it
is used in foreign policy rhetoric.

Also, Bush/Perot won't need to set up concentration camps and labor camps,
the Almighty Dollar takes care of that for us. All you need to do is keep
on pushing the haves and have-nots farther and farther apart and it will
happen "emergently" -- through simple lack of empowerment in the choclate
inner city vs. the privilege of the vanilla suburbs. It's just a new form
of slavery with less tangible stockades...

Maybe the voters are finally figuring out how much undemocratic shit is

Subject: Creation Sucked

Creation sucked, mostly because the police were busting people right and left.
There were two female narcs there one dark asian woman with a killer body and
a g-string bathing suit, she would go up to people and ask for or to buy drugs
if you gave/sold some to her she went away replaced by the police who scooped
you up and took you to jail.  I saw this happen to TWO people (on guy is a 
regular on the scene and a really nice guy, he often gave stuff away) after that
I and a few other people out-ed the Bitch (no misogeny intended but she was
a female dog!).  I "playfully" shot my supersoaker200 at her to let her know we 
knew whats up.  They disappeared for about an hour only to return.  I had 
major words with one of the cops there, (I didn't give a fuck, I was clean
AND sober) and told him he was an ashole for busting people and why didn't and if he was so concerned about drug use I could tell him about a Crack House nearby
but that the big difference between them and this scene was that the dealers
there had MAC-10s, and were just try to dance and have fun.  After a while,
I actually had a reasonable conversation with him, I told him about the scene (nothing he couldn't discover from reading sfweekly:) and tried to explain to him
why he shouldn't be busting people here, he probibly thought that he was getting
great information but I figured as long as your talking to me, your not busting anybody.

Subject: Magic Kingdom/Fantasia


Did anyone go to Magic Kingdom last night in Berkeley?  It was ok...too
many people in too small of an area, with top-rate assholes working the
"door".  They ran out of $5 bills and told everyone that if they didn't 
have exact change, then people would have to pay $20 to get in.  When
people wanted to get in even for $20, the door people still wouldn't 
let people in.  I have no idea of what their problem was, but they should have just let people pay the money.  Not only that, but
as the lines were 10+ people wide, they had the bright idea that they
could get everyone to become sardines and squish into a "line"
no more than 5 feet wide.  Sheesh, talking assholes...

After getting in, however, there were 2 rooms (1 hip hop/funk and 1 techno)
but they were much, much too small...and people were just pushing and pushing 
others all around.  I think that the wrong crowd showed up since that
was the only rave that I know of.

I brought a first-timer there, too, and he is now content of not going
to another rave again... :(  ...because of all the jerks around.  Oh well.

yeah, a bunch of us showed up at MagicKingdom/Wanktasia 'round midnight,
and it looked like a bad scene -- combo of high-school/jock/fratboy
types and girlz w/ big hair. Passed boozy swaggering dickhead crowd
coming in at one point and realized what we could have been in for...
we left because.... 

fortunately -- I TESTIFY!!! --- sfraves saved the day w/ the
last-minute posting about mission rock on fri. Thanks to Richard
Balcon for the pointer. 
 
Basically, I thought it was really great, and markie mark was right-on
(IMHO). 

Neat outdoor balcony overlooking the bay w/ huge, lumbering ships
performing the awesome feat of floating on water, lights ablaze. 

Nobody was there at first (1AM?), but it became comfortably filled by
2AMish w/ still plenty of place to dance or chill. 

definitely the smallest rave i've ever been to... Stupid thing was
shutting it down at 4AM.

PS: perhaps we should engage in the science of determining whether an
upcoming rave will be LA-style (e.g. fantasia) or SF-style (e.g.
come/unity, waldo, woopy ball). Imagine how much time/frustration/gas
could be saved.

	Yes, I was afraid that one wasn't going to do well... they put one on
a few months ago that was also in Berkeley, which also stank.  I think the guys
in the "Magic Kingdom" promoter group are from LA; I remember one of them being
in my UC Berkeley Student Orientation about a year ago.  I was really surprised
to see Garth, Jeno, and Spun listed on the flyer; I thought to myself that 
either they've come clean and those DJ's are willing to work with them, or
they're just putting the names on the flyers without having them confirmed at
all (which is an all-too-common practice in LA). Looks like it may have been
the latter... anyways, now we have TWO rave-groups we know to avoid (Felix the
Cat and Magic Kingdom)

Oops, my mistake.  I guess I didn't stop to think that the rave in Berkeley
that I thought we didn't hear about could be the same rave as Fantasia, which
at that time had an un-disclosed location.  Actualy, I didn't even make the
connection until after I left the thing and a friend told me that it was
Fantasia.  I didn't see the Disney characters that were there or I would have
figured it out on my own.  The organizers did kinda suck.  They were doing
that selective entance thing that some clubs do (read: letting only girls
in) and I did here variable pricing going on.  I saw a guy who worked there
letting in a large group of people around the side so I just tagged along
pretending that I was with them and got in for free.  It could have been
a better, I think the location was cool but it was kinda small inside and
there was a really mixed crowd, that is bad people mixed with good ones.
My friend had two hats ripped off from here booth but fortunately the
stupid thieves couldn't wait 'till the next rave to wear them and we snaged
them back.  I did see other little non-ravelike actions/attitudes but there
were also cool people and I generaly had fun.

P.S. I don't know if I mentioned this in my last post but at Come-Unity
I had this experience of being "on fire" If you know what I mean but I
didn't injest any chemicals of any kind, it was really weird, I had physical
as well as emotional/mental/psychic sensations as well.  When I left 1015
at 5 am I was still "High" as we walked to the car.  After a few minutes
(we went for coffe and muffins at that Mr. Donuts next to Townsend) I was normal
so I know that no one "dosed" my water.  Has anyone else had this experience?
Is this what can happen when a bunch of hardcore ravers get together and
generate a lot of energy or was just 90% of the people in the place on e
and I just was experiencing some form of contact high.

 - I ESCAPE'd at about 3:15AM, so I missed the police wave. Coincidently, as I 
was walking to my truck, I was wondering where the cops were. Maybe, the
promoter didn't let the cops know that the rave was happening, or his 
permits were screwed up. Compared to Waldo, the (average) police presence
was non-existant, until after 4:30. 

 As far as ESCAPE itself, I had a good time. I got to finally hear Carlos do
his salsa mixes - a couple of conga lines even got started! He did a lot of
"straight" techno mixing as well. He really gets into the music - it was the
first time I've seen a DJ who actually danced to the music between segues. 

 The japanese animation was ok, although the soundtrack was inaudible (sub
titles helped). "Giant Robot", and "Gundam", I think, among others. 

 One laser and one mirror ball, in a space twice as big as the "Where's
Waldo" hanger. Projected visuals on a big screen to the left of the stage,
and a screen with animation and computer graphics to the right of the stage.

 The "groove room" mentioned in the flyer was dedicated to house and "mellow 
techno". If things were too wired out on the main floor, the groove room
offered a nice alternative. 

 Who are the IF folks anyway, and what do they do? They had a table there, 
and they were also selling candy and OJ.

 There was a "smart" bar, although they called it an energy bar. Fruit
juices with Life Services powder ( Durk Pearson?). Also, a juice and shaved
ice bar. I patronized both - I hope they sell shaved ice again at the next
big rave I go to!

 Mostly a young crowd , with a very few people who were (obviously) in their 
late twenties or thirties.  The crowd mood was good, although there seemed to 
be a high number of dance-inhibited folks - maybe they were just taking a break.

 I forgot my SFR badge again. Did anybody else make it to ESCAPE besides me 
and Edward? And, how was BASICS? I decided not to pay $15 at the door, as I
intended to ESCAPE, and was only at the club to meet a friend , who didn't 
show up. I spoke to Neils and Giamma as they were entering BASICS - who else
went?

Subject: An Immodest Proposal


	I spent the early part of Saturday driving up the 1 from Santa Cruz,
all the way up to Stinson Beach. Why? Back when we had the discussion about
holding a possible SFR full moon rave, a couple people suggested beaches
along the 1. So, I figured I'd spend some time and check them out. I stopped
at a total of around 20 places, checking out the beach, parking possubilities,
access, possible cop intrusion.... 

	I found the best place to hold a large rave without paying any money
and the lowest risk of anything going wrong would be Bonny Doon Beach, about
9 miles north of Santa Cruz and a mile south of Davenport. I base this on a 
number of things:

	The beach: The beach itself is huge, and surrounded on three sides by
cliffs about 30-50 feet high, creating an almost amphitheatre-like setting.
There is about as much room as there was in the corral at Let Freedom Rave, or
at Grey Whale Cove. And, it is hidden from the highway by a set of railroad
tracks perched 30 feet above the level of the highway along a bluff.

	Parking: There is a parking lot that looks like it could hold maybe
100 cars, but the highway has large shoulders around there (the situation is
similar to, but better than, that at Grey Whale Cove. And the CHP ended up
not towing there.) The UCSC student who proposed the site said the cops don't
ticket after 11pm, and students use the beach all the time for bonfire rallies
and such.

	Access: There isn't a way to get a vehicle on the beach, but the
30-foot bluff isn't a hard hike at all. 

	Legalities: It's not a state beach, so there's no worry about rangers
coming in to shut it down because of "no permits". There are no houses within
a miles (at Davenport, and there were only a few there), so this is really
"out of the way". Like I said above, I guess events are held there without too
much trouble.....


	So is there an interest in holding an SFR rave? 

	I know a lot of people have been jonesing for another picnic, a chance
to meet other sfraves; and the last picnic went extremely well.  So howabout
holding something on a larger scale?

	This is sorta what I'm thinking of: something similar to a full moon
rave but more elaborate. 

	First off, have it on a night other than Friday or Saturday. Thursday
would work well, I think, or maybe Sunday night. This way we won't have to 
compete against other big-$ events for the DJ's.

	Admission: Free (except we ask for donations)

	Sound system: nothing too elaborate, something more than what we had
at the picnic but nothing near to, say, Let Freedom Rave.

	DJ's: like before, I am hoping we could get some of the sfraves
crowd to help. We had some GREAT music at the picnic, btw. Also, I talked to
Spun at Basics last night, and told him about the list, and about this idea,
said he'd be willing to do it if it didn't conflict with any other events.
I may be able to get some other big-namers too.

	Lighting: Since the beach is relatively well-enclosed and really
remote from civilization, it wouldn't hurt to set up some projectors and
color wheels and such.... whatever people on the list could offer would
be terrific. Also, a small bonfire would be cool.

	The crowd/publicity: even though this would be an SFR event, I
don't see why we couldn't make it open to the public. I don't think we'd have
too much trouble in scaring up several hundred people using purely word-of
-mouth, especially if we could get Spun and maybe some others to DJ. 

	Finances: The donations will go first to paying off the sound equipment
and generator rentals, and any other expense in actually putting the thing on,
and the rest of the money would be split between the DJ's and the lighting
people. If we get 400 people, and they all donate $2, we've more than paid off
the sound system (probably around $300), and the generators ($50). When I
talked to Spun I made it clear that we'd only be taking donations and would 
pay him what we could, but it probably wouldn't match what he would make at
a regular event. But we'd try :)

	I'm willing to organize this. Lord knows I have the time, and as long
as I don't lose money I'll be perfectly happy.

	I don't want this to compete against the FMR's - we should have it

I went, my first rave in months -o:(, and had an increddddible time!  
Dancing for four hours (12-4) straight(almost!) with all kinds of  
cool people bopping/hopping and laughing around... Didn't see any sfr  
buttons, but i didn't have one myself either.  I thought the crowd   
was very nice, just a couple semi agro vibes all night. 


I'm not much of a judge, the only other raves i've been to were a  
couple floppies, and about six(?) months ago. They were totally  
different. The dancing scene was much more communal at basics, though  
the couple times i went to floppies, there was lots of cool "other  
stuff" to do (painting, sitar, bizarre flicks), and they were  
cheaper. Still, I'd rather be dancing (esp. to Josh!!!!!) and the  
visuals were way more of a trip at basics... 


I think they should hand out free ear plugs at the door. I can't even  
imagine what sort of ringing I'd be hearing today if I hadn't been  
wearing mine (most of the night).

looking forward to meeting you all (or some ther of)(my back is sore  
from dancing... arghh!)().

	I'm not so sure that Bonny Doon would be all that great an idea. As
a place for a beach-rave, it's great. During high school, I went to several
parties there. The down side to it is that on any given night there are a
large number of high school (read: underage) people partying and drinking, and
it would be quite difficult to find a night when they won't be there. I
have no problem with an all-ages rave, but the thought of a bunch of drunken
high schoolers may be a little, well, improper if the police to decide to
come. There are other good beaches in the area (3- and 4-mile, and some others)
but those are fairly inaccessible from the highway, and certainly don't have
the parking facilities that BD has.

IF is a small business that runs a small concession stand at raves.  They sell

out to make tons o' money.  Most of the people there work for free -- their
reimbursement being free admission to the rave.)

Bush's enthusiastic support for the disastrous policies of Reaganomics
(like cutting taxes for the rich while eliminating benefits for the middle
class and the poor, grossly neglecting the educational system, failing to
regulate healthcare, and generally ignoring the country's infrastructure)
and for the Gulf War (among other things) show that he is worse than a mere
"mental case:" He's an evil conniving bastard. Indeed, in this respect, I
think he is more comparable to Hitler (who was consciously and methodically
evil) than to Reagan (who was far too stupid to be motivated in this way). 
 
How much do we really even know about what has gone on in the past four
years? Whatever happened to the Iran-Contra affair? Is it possible that
this may have had something to do with the war in Iraq? Is it possible that
our major goal was to create a new sense of patriotism and thereby elevate
the President's popularity?


Niels sez:

This is probably the most important reason to GET YOUR ASS TO THE POLLS AND
VOTE FOR CLINTON & GORE!!!!! Overturning Roe v. Wade is only the beginning
of what will happen if the two aging liberals now on the bench are replaced
by Clarence Thomas clones.  This is much scarier that Tipper Gore as

Thing is, that attempting to use psychedelics to brainwash (I initially
typed "brainbash" - typo or Freudian slip?) the masses seems as likely to
backfire as not. By facilitating a change in perceptual perspective,
psychedelics encourage you to "Think for yourself and question authority,"
as the good Dr. Leary has been saying for many years.

W/R/T the venerable H. Ross Pee-rot:
Though we don't know much about him yet, the preliminary signs are pretty
scary. His lack of committment to any real political platform means that he
can do anything he wants to as President without fear of people accusing
him of going back on his word.

Furthermore, his control of a large computer organization means that he is
clued in to the power of computers to mindfuck people in ways the Bush
administration does not yet understand (remember GHWB's amazement at that
cutting-edge supermarket technology the bar-code reader a year or so
back?). Perot's technological bent could prove a good thing: The idea of
electronic democracy is at root a good one, though an appropriate
implementation is yet to be proposed;and his investment in NeXT shows,
IMHO, that he does have an eye for a good idea.  However, there is also a
scary spectre of Big Brother that raises its head here...

I'd be interested to hear what others think about these issues,
particularly regarding e-democracy, p-drugs, the rest of the mediated
world.  If it's not postworthy, mail me privately!

Hi Brian,

It's the basement at 1015 Folsom, if you paid the $10 to get into

Y'all,
we're happy to report that the rave force was 
with us:  the freerealing rave was totally XLNT!  everyone
came through with frying colors.  Alex (of the illfated
island rave-- a very nice guy) offered his totally
excellent sound system for the price we would have
paid for something much worse, and equally important,
a serious sound expert and veteran of years of doing
clubs and tours (New Order, the Shamen...) helped us
set up to get an excellent sound in the warehouse--- 
clear crisp and loud.  the interactive video was a real
hit, as was Dr. Dream's juice stand, with watermelon
juice over shaved ice, carrot juice with ginger (zingy stuff),
wheatgrass shots, and more wonders, all freshly made before
your very eyes.  good lighting, film loops, strobes,
nifty neon behind a long white curtain decorated with
fluourescent paint, vendors selling brightly colored
hats, shirts and jewelry... have i left anything out, Nigel?

the crowd poured in immediately
after we opened and we had a steady stream for over
3 hrs, slowing to a trickle after; the final count 
(including the organizers) was 576. a fair 
number of them were real ravers, complete
with funny hats, danglies, whistles and dancemania.
there was no problem at all getting this crowd dancing.
in the end we had 6 DJs doing about an hour each.  the 
1st 3 DJs, Jeff, Sean and Daisy(who spins in Dallas & came
down for the rave), spun really xlnt deep house, very close to
the typical SF rave fare.  the crowd loved it.  i think
we introduced alot of Austin people to the wonders of
house.  the 4th DJ, Herb, did darker more druggy
stuff.  then Pineapple, a hawaiian raver who has spun at 
raves in LA (viz. China Syndrome) and CHicago, came on 
with techno madness, and Gary 'Fast' Lane brought us
through the dawn, ending with the traditional circle
dance on the last song for the remaining faithful.  then
we all went down to the river to go skinny-dipping. ahhhh.
already people are talking about the next one...

keep it alive,
Steve

Subject: Re: How not to have fun -- drugs and ranting 

Bill, 

  I like your point that we are basically agreeing on our final
conclusions despite our bickering about the way we describe the
reasons for doing so.  I think a lot of this tends to point out a type
of `generation gap' very prevalent in society (although not
everywhere.)

  Your message went on to clarify that gap, as I noted I was very
offended by what I perceive as overly snobbish and presumptuous
remarks.  I realized that Jon Drukman had quoted the material from
Puccio's otherwise great message which really bothered me the most and
put me on my responding tirade pointing out all the little
disagreements we have.

  One thing I saw from the beginning while responding was that there
is a lot of similar knowledge between older people and younger people,
but that the older people learned it >despite< some the the same
things younger people learned it >because<; as example, the education
system and what it tends to teach about psychological thinking, past
vs. now, is ever so slightly different, and now I think enough more
accurate; I go about trusting the very things that others have labored
hard to learn to not trust.  I'm not saying education is doing perfect
now, just a bit different.  Or perhaps my education is my parents,
KQED, and a few key teachers in schools you can't find in many other
places; so be it, it's history.

  As a result of these differing ways of learning similar things, we
have much different ways of talking about things, and indeed the
differences bring up things which we frequently mistake for the same
things we had to unlearn from our individual recollections of the
societal `evil norm' or whatever, and so naturally we see the other
person say something with a throbbing sore thumb yelling `I am wrong'
in our own world, which in their world means something totally
different.

  There are methods to avoid this, I think mostly by just being aware
of what one is saying and how it might be interpreted by everyone, but
despite all this I do appreciate and value Puccio and your comments
despite the sometimes poorly packaged methods of communication.


" He does not ever advocate that we outlaw drugs, or even that people
" don't take drugs.

True, but the sense and feeling of it was of almost too-general
disapproval, something which in my world has always screamed `overly
protective under-educated person' (despite the truth.)

" He tells you about a certain effect this certain drug has -- a
" subtle effect, longer-lasting than 6 hours -- and warns you that
" this effect might surprise you.

That was worded nicely, thanks -- it >might< surprise me.  I
appreciate that thoughtfulness, and hope such thoughtfulness is spread
more in the world.  I will take what he says to heart with that in
mind (and already have,) and although I already knew it might surprise
me the fact that someone is saying this again makes me even more
attentive to the possibility.  Saying that it >will< surprise me
though I would see as offensive and almost an attack.


" You knee-jerk reactors, with your "you can have my drugs when you pry
" them from my cold, dead fingers" attitude are not only overreacting,
" but you are insulting a person much wiser than you.
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Everyone I ever knew from Apple had this snobbishness problem.  I
think likes attract.  This is an example of something I find very
offensive.

" position that drugs don't kill people, people kill people.

While what the Libertarians have to say should be listened to for a
lot of good thoughts and things to consider in life, I don't
wholeheartedly support their ideas.  It's like saying guns don't kill
people so don't ban them.  I think drugs are more than just totally
innocent (as I probably overstated in one post to try to communicate a
concept of learning,) but less than the evil mongerer themselves;
something around being a substance which people should pay extra
attention to if they have to contact it in one way or another.


" Ranting is the opposite of raving.

I value people when they can rant in the spirit of raving and be
friendly, helpful while increasing the good will and feeling so part
of raving all along; true talent goes into that.  [Me ignoring that
you were trying to make a catch phrase.]


  I have taken only one illegal drug, and that only once, in my life.
What did I learn?  I loved it, but that I took about twice as much as
I should have and could have loved it tenfold if I had taken the right
amount.  (I also learned other things too.)  I don't think I'm going
to being clenching on to too many drugs with cold hard fingers.  I'm
learning how all the people I grew up with spouting `drugs are really
really bad' is a lot of contrived crap (not without cause, but
certainly not fairly represented.)  You are probably learning how all
the hippie types yelling `drugs are all really good' is wrong.
Generation gap.

geoff white says:

>Jon's 12 inch was AWSOME!!

i don't think that's possible.  the only DJ at Comeunity who had it
was Garth and we've heard through the grapevine that neither he nor
Jeno are likely to play it - "too techno."  On the other hand, at
Basics this weekend, both Spun and Josh played it.

speaking of this weekend...

friday night we tried to do Fantasia but the line was appalling and
the crowd certainly didn't look wonderful.  we left quickly and headed
to mission rock.  i wasn't as impressed as niels was.  the crowd was
tiny (maybe 25 dancers, max), and the music was solid but
unimpressive.

saturday was basics at the trocadero.  as the name implied, it was
pretty damn basic.  small visual projection set up, the usual club
lighting rig and a DJ, basically.  we got there to hear the tail end
of markie mark's set.  i don't know what's happening to him, but his
sets have been getting less and less exciting.  josh followed with a
strong performance, made all the stronger by the inclusion of the
Ultraviolet Catastrophe single!  (and he played it right after los
kings del mambo, which REALLY got me pumped.)  i started to fall
asleep on my feet after josh, so i don't remember much past that
point.  i woke up when spun came on, because he always has a very
attention-getting intro.

Hi! If anyone out there is going to the full moon rave tonight and happens to
be passing through Santa Cruz (or can be bribed to) or is leaving from somewhere
nearby, I (and another sfraver) would really really like a ride. We both find
ourselves carless, but in the mood to rave. pure torture. Anyway, if you could
either e-mail me back or call me at (408)426-4753 [I am completely aware of the

What a politician promises and does...  doesn't mean jack, unfortunately.
Look at the way that people are holding Bush to his election-winning
promise "read my lips, no new taxes" after he announced he's going to have
to raise taxes.

(Gee George, why don't you stick to your promises and instead withdraw that
monstrously huge soviet aid package instead? Or at least spend that money
to fix the rotten infrastructure in US inner cities...  But hey, we
taxpayers have got to pay for the S&L bailout that is a direct result of
Bush's policies under Reagan... after all, Bush was in charge of overseeing
S&L deregulation....) Anyways...

I need to check my facts on this, but I recall reading a story w/r/t perot
strong-arming a large corporation during business negotiations by having
his company (EDS) stop maintenance on the company's computers.

With such excellent negotiating skills, he's obviously qualified to be
president, no?

Maybe I'm a pessimist, but I see e-democracy as going the other direction
-- as a wedge to further divide the haves and the have-nots. Through
computerization, the haves will become further empowered, further educated,
and will have skills that will ensure that they are paid more money to do
less work (therefore being able to spend more free-time further educating
and empowering themselves and their offspring). They'll be able to use
computers to become informed on govt. policies and vote to ensure their
self interests are protected....

Meanwhile, the have-nots will be left out in the dark, laboring in the
proverbial coal mines -- in manual labor, manufacturing, and service jobs.
Unlike their compu-empowered counterparts, they'll spend all their energy
just trying to make the next rent check, with less free time to educate
themselves and their children. They won't be able to become informed, nor
use the information "floating about" to make decisions to further their
interests, vote, etc. Of course, this vicious cycle ensures a steady supply
of manual-labor wage slaves for the compu-empowered ruling class.

Computers & software are different from books/teachers/pen/paper because
they're so damn expensive & knowlege intensive. The result is that you
won't find a ratio anywhere near one-computer-per-student at an inner-city
school, but you will in Menlo Park, West Palo Alto, Atherton... thus we see
the beginnings of this great societal division.

Both Bush and Perot are pretty far away from "the real world" -- they're up
there in the ethereal world of super-wealth where they probably have other
people wiping their bottoms for them. Their distance from the majority of
americans makes me not trust either of them to do anything other than
further the lot of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and under
classes.

An example of their mental distance from the populace is suggested by their
use of archaic, racist language:
	* Bush's "little brown ones" gaffe..
	* Perot addressing an NAACP convention as "you people" rather
	  than "we" or "we the people" or ...

I didn't see any disney characters. There was two rooms one playing hip-hop
the other playing techno. I can't tell you to much about them for the fact that
it was way to crowded. You could've paid $15-20 do to them running out of $5's.
Or you could've walked around the lake or what ever it was for about 4miles and
get in for free! which would've been the better of the two! but I paid! allwell
It was very Oaklandish meaning there was some heavy attitudes that I encountered
with people who don't know what raves are about! but hey I've been going through

Uh, I guess I'm drawn back into this thing.  Sigh.

I appreciate the nice remarks sprinkled in your message.

The content about a 'generation gap' I didn't really follow.  Implications 
about my experiences growing up, or educational opportunities, or whatever, I
think ought not be attempted.  They may not be so different as you might think,
with the exception of remembering stuff like the Kennedy assasination, Vietnam
and Watergate, rather than learning about them after the fact.

My perception of what happened with this rantstorm, if in fact it was a
manifestation of some sort of generation gap, was that I said something roughly
of the form

* Here's a pitfall people rarely (if ever) mention
* It is a more serious pitfall than short-termers like vitamin deficiency
* I experienced it in my own life, and think what I went through was pretty
  serious
* Watch out for this ... it's subtle
* Here are a couple of guidelines for avoiding this kind of trouble

This message was posted in the midst of a flurry of ranting and was immediately
drawn into it.  Somehow, the perception got out there that I was trying to
scare people off from X, when in reality what I was doing was to try to inform
people of negative effects that they could largely avoid through rational
behavior.  It's as though I was saying (different context) "you might get an
STD from a really clean-appearing partner, so be sure to wear a condom," but
was thought to have said "abstain from sex".

> but the sense and feeling of it was of almost too-general disapproval

Well, I don't know where people got this from.  Anyway, it's not true.  OK?
I hope this case is closed.  The fact is, I don't either approve or disapprove.
I believe people should learn how to exercise good judgement rather than follow
blanket generalizations.

> something which in my world has always screamed `overly protective
> under-educated person' (despite the truth.)

My opinions on chemical use have nothing to do with 'education,' which in my
opinion is pretty dicey, being so dependent on the quality of one's sources.
It is entirely based on personal experience, which can't be counterfieted.

>> You knee-jerk reactors, with your "you can have my drugs when you pry them
>> from my cold, dead fingers" attitude are not only overreacting, but you are
>> insulting a person much wiser than you.

Uh, this statement is hard for me to talk about, since I am the subject.  But
(and this may not be wise), I'm going to try anyway.  First, I think BC was
right about people overreacting.  Second, the bit about my putative wisdom, I
hope, will be mostly seen as a (futile) attempt of a friend to defend in some
fashion *his* friend from what he saw as an unfair and unnecessary attack.
Let's just bury this.  It's really not interesting, nor terribly productive.

> I'm learning how all the people I grew up with spouting `drugs are really
> really bad' is a lot of contrived crap

Well, uh, mostly.  In this particular issue, gross generalizations will get you
nowhere.  Each chemical has its own properties, and should be considered on
its own terms (which the government refuses to do intelligently).  

> You are probably learning how all the hippie types yelling `drugs are all
> really good' is wrong.

No, it's incorrect.  I am a 'hippie type.'  I make no such blanket statements.
Blanket statements about generations are about as useless as blanket statements
about chemicals.  Try to hear what people are saying, rather than figuring out
how to classify them pre-parse.

Anyway, let's move on ...

Subject: re: more ranting w/r/t politics etc.

VooDoo here to play devil's advocate!  We all know a few things about this
nations recent political history.  Among the most glaring facts is that the
republicans have resided and ruled from the whitehouse for some two decades
(subtract that Ford for Prez blunder circa 1976).  However, this will be the
first time that the republican administration will have no one else to blame
but themselves for all of the current horrors; big gov. overspending, the
blights of deregulation, unemployment, mis-, dis, and poor edumacation,
the list really does go on and on.  But the only scapegoat that our good 
friends the press and the republican party has been able to find (that is,
besides us people) is the democrats; either in congress, senate, or the pre-
vailing ills from the dreaded Carter administration.  So what is the POINT?
Well, lets say that Boosh is elected for a second term. (Yeah, I said it!)
Who does he have to blame for all of his problems?  He inherits only the 
fruits of his own lame-ass and his 'scroggin on the boezak' partner Reagan's
policies (or at least his administration's policies).  No thinking, or non-
thinking middle, lower, or anything other than uppermost-class individual is
going to even think about acknowledging the blame for our nations problems 
over the next 4 years.
	On the other hand, if a democrat gets elected -- the soft-bellied 
Clinton (WE WANT DA FUNK, GOTTA HAVE DAT FUNK!) and Gore (watsa matta?  Cuomo
gas faced the democrats AGAIN?) ticket just think about what they will reap 
and how they will fare against the awaiting onslaught from political foes,
press, right-wing, left-wing, and a host of politically unincorporated.  I
find it hard to believe given the little that has been said that the democrats
will be able to do anything more than choke and drown in the quagmire that 
has been prepared for them in the unlikely event of victory.  In fact, if they
win it might just be a bail-out for the republican party and a brief interim 
between the next two-decade plunge into politico-socio-economic absurdity.  
The devil's advocate avers thusly, the democrats have absolutely nothing to 
gain by winning the whitehouse this term.  Another dismal four years with a
republican president, especially Boosh, who is such a familiar face in all of
the recent scamdals (<--- not a typo) is exactly the sort of throttling that
the american public needs to jolt us out of oblivion and rhetoric, force us to
mobilize socially, economically, and politically and DEMAND of our elected 
officials RESPECT and DUTIFUL service.  Right now not only do we settle for 
less, we often settle for NOTHING!
	Okay, that was pretty long-winded, I know.  The flame flickers but it 
is not yet off.  The devil taps me on the shoulder, winks, and signals for a 
respite.  AHHhhhhhhhhhh, are we having fun with this yet or not?

Subject: the devil's advocate returns!

Well, it seems as though I ignored an important issue - that of the changing 
face of the supreme court.  Obviously, barring some bizarre twist of fate, we 
are concerned with the longevity and replacement of two to three of the jus-
tices.  Specifically, we can assume (ass-out-of-u-and-me?) that judges 'long-
dong' thomas, 'bull' oconnor, 'big tony' scalia, 'california's own' kennedy,
'alfalfa' souter, 'bill-the-pill' rehnquist are there for at LEAST four more 
years.  In question are justices blackmun, stevens, and white.  Now of these
three the two most likely to drop in the next term are white and blackmun.
Granted, a choice of a narrow-minded conservative for both seats will be 
harmful for future landmark decisions(picture roe v wade going 4-5 rather than
5-4) it would be awful difficult to sneak another shady character through the
confirmations let alone two.  Three would simply be overestimating the net 
asininity index for the senate!  SO, what does the devil suggest?  He urges me
to assert that as important as the supreme court is to the judicial interpreta-
tion of constitutional rights of the INDIVIDUAL, it has far less to do with the
total picture for the next four years, it may not even be expected to undergo 
major personnel (sp) changes over the next four years and it may not undergo 
ANY!  What then is the purpose (in light of this and the last devil's comment)
of a democratic whitehouse?  Certainly not to preserve the status quo of the 
supreme court as it will most likely preserve itself!

SFRAVES is in desperate need of a shave and therefore it's time to
bring out Occam's Razor.

	1) An awful lot of people are going to read what you say --
	   the impact of your message is a lot greater than Usenet
	   News, since mailing lists don't have kill files or other
	   such conveniences.

	   You can think of it this way: SFRAVES costs enough in terms
	   of mailer expense, lost productivity, etc, to employ
	   several people with the full-time job of meticulously
	   transcribing your words onto parchment.

	   In sum: are you sure that what you are saying is THAT
	   important? 

	2) Many other fora for discussion exist. Each one has a
	   nominal charter -- talk.politics.drugs, for example, exists
	   to talk about drug legalization/criminality, and alt.drugs
	   exists to talk about pharmacology.

	3) It would be in the best interests of this mailing list, and
	   by extension in the best interests of the Rave Scene (if
	   you will) to keep this particular mailing list centered on
	   its nominal charter: raves.

	4) If people know what to expect from this mailing list, they
	   will tend not to leave.

	5) Having a lot of people on this mailing list is good for the
	   Rave Scene.

	6) Occam's Razor, paraphrased, says that discussions which are
	   sufficiently off the point can and should be trimmed back.

Suggestion: Let's keep the discussion in this group centered around
raves. 

I realize that I am just as guilty of violating this principle as
anyone else on this list. But I came to realize my error by the
following guideline: 

	when it is something fun to talk about, and when the summary
	of the subject includes the word "rave", then it is something
	I should be talking about,

	when it is something "important" that "has" to be talked
	about, and it is only tangentially if at all related to raves,
	it is something that I should think twice about before
	posting.

But hey, these are my guidelines, and as you can see, I don't stick to
them very well either.

I posted info to the list as soon as I found out, which was around 6:30.

Maybe I did get a little paranoid about getting info out over this net

My dear Mr. Heinous, the discussion on the list in the past week
has been *precisely* about raves, their attendant subculture, and
the personality mods, desired or otherwise, that come out of it.
That's why, by the way, I liked Jim Puccio's comments. 
Further, the nature of the rave scene seems to lead some folks
to think about political repression. This is a Good Thing. 
Most of us find the discussions here to be interesting.  There have been 
netiquette discussions before, but perhaps we've needed to experience
a new level of condecension and phony modesty.  Personally, I prefer other 
forms of mind expansion.


If all you want is the rave calendar, subscribe to that.  Or press
'd' more.

Markie Mark seems to get better as he warms up with each
set. I'm usually unimpressed by his first hour or so of
playing, but then he can really put together a great set for
hours after that. 

It was so this morning in the hills.  Great day.  I had to
leave because I was too tired (and thank god that was the
only problem left after it all -- thanks Geoff!)  It was one
of those times when I was dancing halfway between the crowd
and my car, since my body was torn in two as to what to do. 

I've always loved being at Townsend when there are only a
few other people there to enjoy it, and someone (usually
Markie Mark) starts playing really good stuff.  Sometimes I
wish there were more people to enjoy it, but there's
something nice about having an almost personal DJ in the
morning.

P.S. I got the FMR directions at 8:55 PM here at
Ulmo@MCIMail.Com. Because of the way the Soda mailer works
and the intermediate computers inbetween, some other people
may get posts much later than this, but I suspect it wasn't
all Soda's fault the mail got out so late for some folks;
perhaps you can run a few tests on your local distributer to
see what the longest response time is?

Sigh. I am especially sorry that my point seems to have totally eluded
you.

I thought it was clear that I was asking people to keep the discussion
centered on raves. What does drug legalization have to do with that?
What do Ross Perot and George Bush have to do with that?

I was suggesting, as a guideline for those who agree with me, that
Occam's Razor is a good guide: ask yourself "what does this have to do with
Rave?" If the answer is "a lot" then by all means post your brains out. But
if your discussion has more to do with talk.politics.*, you might consider
moving your discussion there.

It was not my intention to turn into a boring, rantful preacher.
Pardon me if you thought I did.

I am especially amused, though, that you rail against courtesy,
calling it "condescension and phony modesty." Apparently you are so
bitter and upset that you cannot see people attempting to be nice to
each other as anything BUT "condescension and phony modesty."

Certainly you can't seem to understand WHY people would wish to be
nice to each other.

I guess this explains why you missed my point so utterly, and blasted
me for hypocrisy and preachiness.

This is doubtful. Blackmun, in particular is "holding on to life" so that
he can make it past the election. If he dies before the election it's one
more nail in the coffin of democracy -- and he knows it. I guess that can
be pretty a pretty motivating reason to live.

If we don't have individual rights, what do we have? We could have a very
smooth running, efficient government, without dissent, if we become
fascist. But "smooth" or "efficient" is not the point. Freedom is.

Countries like Singapore are doing great economically, have a solid
infrastructure, low crime, etc. But at what cost? (I for one would never
want to live there, I'd probably be executed).

Yes, I do worry about a Clinton admininstration inheriting all the crap
that's been swept under the rug by Reagan/Bush, but that's the price you
have to pay for change. I don't think it is worth it to have 4 more years
of Bush destroying the country, just so that we can say "see, I told you
so" while pointing at the smoldering remnants of our country.

There is the possibility that the economy will rebound with Clinton in
office, which may ensure an 8 year term. That's the only reason why Reagan
got re-elected... and it was less due to policy changes than it was to
rhetoric: the economy is a self fulfilling prophesy -- hide the problems,
and "talk positively" (ala Reagan) and it will go up (until it crashes),
expose the problems and "talk negatively" (ala Carter) and it will go down.

Fact is, the economy is running on vapors right now, and everybody knows it
-- so maybe it's time to tighten the belt, pay the bills, and try to start
afresh.

Gee whiz...  words so vague that *I* should become a politician.

Subject: Howling at the Full Moon Rave -- YAHOOOOOOOO!!


This was my first full moon rave -- what a truly excellent party. I'm
almost speechless. Actually, I'm just giddy from lack of sleep -- only got
about 3.5 hrs of it cuz I left there round 8AM and still made it in to work
today.

The music was a roller coaster ride -- 85% great, 15% boring.  The boring
portions allowed time for much needed rest between ravaerobics, and time to
meet lots of other friendly ravers.

What was that way funky DEEP stuff being played around 6:30AM (?), and who
was playing it?

And yes, they played "Jon Drukman's 12 inch" in it's full massive, veinous,
throbbing length (i.e. they didn't fade it out before the dead-can-dance
vocal samples). I don't know which DJ threw it on, but it was played around
sunrise. (Kudos to Mike Wertheim, Jon Drukman, and Jeff	Taylor for creating
a rave "greatest hit" and an excellent sunrise song too).

Location couldn't have been better. The dancefloor was nestled in a canyon
surrounded by hills on all sides -- the ultimate in seclusion. Parking was
completely off-road, therefore no evidence of strange-goings-on to passing
motorists and police. (I never saw a single police patrol!!).  It was warm
enough to dance in a T-shirt...

This is definitely what summer is about!

I wish they had set up the speakers on the flat part of the "valley" since
it was somewhat difficult to dance on the relatively steeply sloped hill.
Makes it easier to "skank" tho.

We should consider this site for an sfraves party!

Tim Leary at the Learning Annex: "Putting the 'High' Back in High
Technology"

The Union Square Holiday Inn in San Francisco was the unlikely site
for last Saturday's presentation on "Electronic Mind Expansion" by Tim
Leary, Genesis and Alaura of Psychic TV, and Dave and Andy of
Hyperdelic video.  It was easily the best multimedia presentation I've
ever experienced.  Tim gave what is more or less his standard rap
these days: that first psychedelics and now electronics are giving
individuals the power to take back control over the programming of
their own minds.  His talk was divided into bite-size segments, which
were interspersed with video extravaganzas by Hyperdelic with taped
sounds interjected by the PTV-ers.  The video stuff included
mantra-like repetitions of bits of text like: " re	 de non
un	 seer	 memes	 focus	 overload", frenzied montages of
eyeballs, wireframe shapes constantly going inside out, and good shit
like that.  Leary swept through history at a dizzying pace, from the
Delphi oracle ("Know thyself") through spectacular power of the
Chartes cathedral, down to the Beat poets and now the power of
computer-driven sound and images to induce "mutual trance formation"
or "custom designed hallucinations".  In other words, the whole
ancestry of rave culture was unrolled before our very eyes and
(seated) bodies.  Only the industrial era seems to have attempted to
segregate tahe sacred from the profane, religion from theater,
individual from group, and love from fun.  


Some of the points have been made before, such as that learning occurs
best in small conversational groups, or that television is an
oppressive medium.  Yet the manner of presentation did make a major
point about using overwhelming primarily visual stimulation to create
a mental state of receptivity and openness.  There was a lot of "left
brain (linguistic/rational) bad / right brain (intuitive/visionary)
good" ranting, but to Tim's credit, he pointed out that the left-right
brain dichotomy is really only a metaphor and is not anatomically
valid.  It's just a way of talking about the ineffable, about that
which cannot be put into language.  And talk he did, fielding
questions for about 90 minutes, with help from Genesis, Alaura, Dave,
and Andy.  The discussion ranged over direct neural interfaces (Alaura
recounted some truly hideous experimental failures), those funny LED
goggles (Tim sez they work and are worthwhile), tactile prostheses for
the blind, and assorted virtual reality stuff.  Cool names dropped
included Greek drunkard Socrates, Canadian professor Marhsall McLuhan,
half-blind Englishman Aldous Huxley, Berkeley chemist Alexander
Shulgin, interface designer Brenda Laurel, exo-botanist Terrence
McKenna and that other famed cyber-self-promoter, Ted Nelson.  "I'm
not a scientist, I'm really an ad man" sez Tim.  Topics not mentioned
included: tantric sex, nutritional supplements, bungie jumping.  All
in all a much better presentation of the stuff he talked about at
Rhythm Society / WAX back in March.

My respect for Genesis P. Orridge has increased tremendously.  He may
indeed be a charlatan who makes good-to-middling house music, but he's
far more thoughtful and articulate than I'd imagined.  The point of
all the ecstatic emphasis on the non-linguistic mind, he said was "To
end the horrible abuses of the last 25,000 years, since we stopped
looking at the light and started talking to each other".  Hmmmmm.  Am
I really down wid this program?  Of course a woman in the audience had
to ask Thee Obvious Question: what about the body's other activities
besides vision?  So Genesis gave Thee Obvious 30-second manifesto
about rave energy, ecstatic dancing for 12 hours, bodily smells, &c.
Was she a shill? ...  And he has the coolest ripped up denim vest! The
back size has one of those, like, pyramid thingies with the eyeball?
and the legend "Illuminati MC Bavaria".  To die for.

Leary and Orridge make a great team; they complement each other
perfectly.  While I'm a bit too much of text kind of a guy to agree
with everything that was said, they weren't really presenting 12 steps
to salvation anyway.  The claim that the benefits or "goals" of
mind-expansion cannot be expressed in language is partly a truism and
partly a copout.  Much like my, and other folks, heartfelt hope that
raves are more than just a peculiarly exhausting form of entertainment
but show by example a better way to feel and to live with other
people.  Half hype, half truth, and all infotainment.  This is late
20th century industrial culture, we're not going to become Tibetan or
Native Americans (those of us who aren't to begin with), and the path to
enlightenment that lead from this culture to "the light" makes use of
the best discoveries of psychedelic research and high-bandwidth
human-computer interaction.  To rediscover the non-linguistic mind
need not mean abandoning good stuff like CD's and e-mail and
transportation.  You can't go home again (well maybe just to change
clothes).  Human history doesn't repeat, it rhymes.

although it would have been better if the dancing area was a bit more level.

I spent about the 1st 45 minutes directing traffic and helping to squeeze

Largely a truism if the definition of language is limited to the verbal and
the pseudosubtleties of body posturing.  But one could go further and declare
that *any* form of language (i.e. communication) reinforces the illusion
of separation, and therefore defeats the goal of Ultimate Unity, Universal
Consciousness, etc.  On the other hand, communication/langauge would seem
to be required in order to 'get there from here'.

Yes, it is important to remember that while the rave scene itself 
is not the source of this ideal, it does provide an atmosphere 
for it to be expressed.  When the scene dies out, (which
unfortunately seems to be happenning sooner rather than later),  many 
of us will continue to find ways to express it just as many of us
were before raves.  Hopefully, the raves have provided an avenue of
communication for those who may have not been exposed to the degree to 
which such ideals could be actualized.

> Half hype, half truth, 

Like most things.

>and all infotainment. 

Which makes the things that raves, Leary and others are expressing 
significantly different than religious or political movements in that
there is at least an attempt by this modern approach toward mind
expansion to incorporate an objective openness where information is
valued simply *because* it is information, and information that leads
to more openness (and thus more information) is valued even more...
Religious and political movements tend to get mired in dogma, subjectivity,
and the preaching of what is 'right' and what is 'wrong', becoming
stagnant like most forms of human thought.

Nevertheless, I find it interesting how much less I feel the need
to go only my bi-weekly CD buying binges, watch TV, rent videos,
travel during vacations, etc. since I've been raving.  The (what I
consider to be) high quality aspects of rave culture seems to have
made me be more selective in other aspects of my life.

believe it or not, it was played by JENO!  i don't know what's going
on, but we had heard through the grapevine that garth and jeno weren't
going to play it because it wasn't "their style."  however, dj robert
(south bay DJ) told us that jeno did indeed play it at the FMR, and
used it to get out of a very trancy set.  niels, can you confirm what

"the illusion of separation" ?
does that mean there is no separation ?
god, take me now.  please.

I'll sleep when I'm dead.

I think I prefer the latter.

I usually prefer a compass.

okay, I guess this is the part where I have to figure out
how to tie things up with rave-related rope.

ideal communicative ability ?  telepathy ?
I don't want anyone reading my mind, thanks.

>When the scene dies out, (which

my opinion is that some people's attention spans will move them
from the rave scene to something else.  this may lead to the
demise of the "scene" and it may not.  it will probably lead
to the emergence of something which may be more interesting.

>many of us will continue to find ways to express it just as many of us
>were before raves.  

I'd venture to guess that some people on this list feel as if
they'd been "raving" long before raves began, and will not discontinue
if/when they stop attending Official Rave Functions.

of course, I might be wrong.

>Hopefully, the raves have provided an avenue of

"where information is valued simple *because* it is information"--
this sounds like me.  I'll take anything you want to tell me and 
file it away, along with your shoe size, height, weight, locks of
hair if you'll give them to me.  the danger here is that I personally
fear that access to information which is used for what I would consider
to be the wrong reasons is growing at a more rapid pace than access
to information that leads to more openness.  call me paranoid, but
I'm not so sure I want more openness to my personal information.

who's leary affilited with these days anyway ?
who the fuck does he work for ?

does this make any sense ?

I value information on anything and anyone.  that's why I'd love

Subject: "Likes attract likes" or "Opposites attract"?

Those of you who believe that the purpose of this list is to discuss
whether last night's rave was more or less trippy than the previous night's
should stop reading now (and press "d", flame me for being a snobbish
asshole, or both).

Others please read on.
 
(1) I'm not certain, but I believe that Mr. Heinous's application of
Occam's
    Razor as a limiting principle for the content of this list is
incorrect.
    At the risk of wasting sf-raves bandwidth with something that should
    instead be posted to
    sci.philosophy.so.obscure.that.nobody.interesting.reads.it.anyway, I
would
    like to point out that Occam's Razor is traditionally applied as a
principle
    suggesting that all other things being equal, the simplest, most 
    parsimonious explanation of a particular phenomenon is the best. For
    example, the statement "Likes attract likes" is simpler and more 
    parsimonious that "All Apple employees are snobbish assholes," as the 
    general statement subsumes the statement about Apple employees,
[;-)]and can
    be applied to employees of other companies as well. Occam's Razor, in
my 
    understanding, has noting to do with DISCUSSIONS, only with
EXPLANATIONS.

(2) While I admit that neither the "drugs & raves" discussion nor the
recent 
    "political" discussion is directly relevant to raving, both topics (as 
    AstroBoy points out) are RELATED to raves and their attendant culture.
All 
    of us on the list seem to share some fundamental interests (i.e.
raving) and
    values (i.e. a sense of community). To me, this list serves as a
vehicle for
    discussing and sharing ideas that relate to these interests and values,
and
    I think both politics and drugs fit this bill nicely. Yes, these
discussions
    could be moved to various USENET groups. However, then the shared
background
    (and open-mindedness) that comes along with our common interest in
raves 
    would be gone. Each topic (drugs, politics, etc.) would be discussed in
its 
    own context; there would be no room for cross-pollination of ideas.

Does sfraves need a shave?

On one hand, 25 pieces of email a day is quite a lot. I was away last week
and found 106 messages in my little mbox when I returned. Wasting millions
upon millions of bits of valuable Internet bandwidth, not to mention
gigabytes of disk space, teracycles of cpu time, and countless oodles of
employer and employee time and $$$.

On the other hand, I enjoyed reading nearly every message, as they were
filled with interesting ideas and fresh perspectives. I don't know where
else I might have been exposed to such discussions. Such discussions have
been the basis for meeting people I would not otherwise have met, and
starting many new friendships. This doesn't seem to happen much on
USENET...

Time is money, but money can't buy me love.

To sum up, I agree with AstroBoy:

>If all you want is the rave calendar, subscribe to that.  Or press
>'d' more.

However, if the general consensus is that raves are "all-night disco-like
club-events," rather than "ritualistic gatherings of like-minded
individuals," I'll be happy to shut my electronic yap and look elsewhere
for a forum discussion.

Many people in rave culture give lip service about building a community. We're

Cynthia sez:

Only if you are trying to listen.

>"the illusion of separation" ?
>does that mean there is no separation ?

I am proposing that the degree to which most people see things as 
disconnected is illusionary.  Additionally, there are others who 
have experienced reality as being completely devoid of separation
between themselves and the things around them.  Another illusion
perhaps, but no more than anyone else's experience of reality.

Bob's original post that I was responding to stated:

	|of entertainment but show by example a better way to feel 
	|and to live with other people. 

To me this "better way..." alluded to an 'ideal' inherent in the more
spiritual aspects of raving.  Bob's post also mentioned Leary spoutings
of stuff that is at least tangential to rave culture, like " giving
individuals the power to take back control over the programming of
their own minds." and " using overwhelming primarily visual stimulation 
to create a mental state of receptivity and openness."

That is why I refer to it as an "ideal".

Yes, the crowd went absolutely bananas! People just started dancing harder,
waving their hands in the air, movin' like they just don't care...
everybody say ho! ... ho!  airybody was whooping it up because we were all
surfing on a new energy wave!

The next song after yer Ultraviolet Catastrophe (UVC) single was also way
hype, so the energy kept going and going and going.

Thanks for clarifying who the DJ was -- I've heard Jeno spin before, but
that was the first time I thought he played a truly godlike set.  (I also
assume he was also the one playing the way deep funky stuff that came on
15-45 mins after UVC.)

I really cannot agree with this, mostly because without verbal language,
there is no thought, and without thought there is no language. I'd go as
far as to say that language *IS* thought, or rather, they're
transformations of each other, much like an image can be represented by a
hologram and vice-versa...

At some point in the future, maybe my hologram will be able to communicate
directly with your hologram without the need for a linguistic laser.
However, I believe that each brain is wired differently enough that even
direct neuronal stimulation will not be sufficient intercommunication --
it'll have to go through the language/vision/sensory centers because that's
the way we map our own neuronal configuration/hologram onto the rest of the
world.

IMHO, the "illusion of separation" that you speak of is no illusion, it is
reality. If anything, "universal consciousness" is the illusion.  People
have been having such hallucinations for centuries, whether it be the
notion of higher-consiousness, pantheism, belief in god, spirit worship, or
some other form of mass-psychosis.

I would hope that modern people learn the precise stimuli needed to
stimulate these "belief in god" brain-erogenous-zones so that we can
mentally masturbate them as needed, and then get on with life.  (Without
becoming religious zealots, LSD-spazzes, or whatever).

I would say this "mental masturbation" (i'm using the term positively
here), opening of the third-eye, or whatever-you-call-it is the goal of the
Leary-folk, and they just have to use the language of our past shared
experience (be it religious, LSD, or whatever) to ground the discussion,
force a shared hermeneutic circle, or what have you.

Bob Carasik (AstroBoy):
>The claim that the benefits or "goals" of
>mind-expansion cannot be expressed in language is partly a truism and
>partly a copout.

A copout...

IMHO, Universal consciousness is an LSD-inspired hallucination. A fun one,
an ego destroying one, a mind-expanding one, a perspective-shifting one,
but a hallucination nonetheless.

And if there's even a chance of achieving the hallucination of universal
consciousness without drugs or psychosis, I think it could only be achieved
by language (whether it be verbal, visual, body, pheromones, etc), or
through some other learned way of stimulating the "belief in god"
brain-erogenous-zones I mentioned above.

And, FYI, 2,344 angels can dance on the head of a pin.

Are you saying that the only things that can be communicated are
thoughts?  What thoughts are communicated during the shared experience
of raving when we're together peaking in a frenzied trance of physical,
emotional and sensory energy during that special moment of *NOW* that
(for me) transcends mere thought?  Or am I really completely alone when 
this happens?   Hello, is there anybody out there...?

>IMHO, the "illusion of separation" that you speak of is no illusion, it is
>reality.

Perhaps it is the typical way in which humans experience reality, but
there is a lot of science that points to the physical universe as one
all encompassing spacetime continuim in which our seemingly separate
structures are no more than transient curvatures of a single geometry.
This statement is, of course, a gross oversimplification, but the
theories of Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity etc. do lead to the
implications that in reality (as modelled by modern science),
we are much much more interconnected then we *seem* to be.

I absolutely, unequivocally, enthusiastically agree with

michael helm> What are dreams?

this is the reason I'm in library school.
I've always been fascinated by indexes,
and dismayed that my mind doesn't have a 
readily accessible user friendly index.
I spend a lot of time writing indexing 
routines to try to figure out how the
fuck my mind does it.

the result of my experiments so far indicate to me that
dreams are the tools the mind uses to index information
into long and short term memory.  this idea is not 
original to me.  I was first exposed to it in a book
by Christoper Lasch, _Landscapes of the Night:  How
and Why We Dream_ (1984).  He goes to great length
to compare the human dream to the process computers
*used* to go through when they shut down everynight
for cleanup.  of course, now the machines don't have
"downtime" they have daemons.  and in my theory, the
daemons are the computer's dreaming.

I could go _on_, but I'll resist.

been unable to express your thoughts because there aren't any 
words for them ?  and what about painting or music ?  can't music
have a visceral emotional effect without the encumbrance of words ?
I thought that was a big reason for non-verbal art -- to communicate
in ways which do not rely on the clumsy arbitrariness of language.
just one more route out of the solipsistic existence we've been
blessed and burdened with.

niels> If anything, "universal consciousness" is the illusion.  

no way.  I love it and I hate it, but the collective unconscious
is there.  how do you think I win money at the racetrack ?
you just have to figure out its index and tap into it.

I think I'm remaining remarkably calm in the face of your telling ME
that MY belief in god is a hallucination.  I don't believe that's
been put in your arena to pass judgment on, thanks.

Subject: Sre:language and mentality

Lee Fogel brought up a nice point recently.  He says:
	"... there is a lot of science that points to the physical universe as
one all encompassing spacetime continuum... theories of quantum mechanics and 
general relativity etc do lead to the implications that in reality (as modelled
by modern science) we are much more interconnected than we *seem* to be..."
	Unfortunately, we(i?) cannot italicize, so I will reiterate the key 
phrase - AS MODELLED BY MODERN SCIENCE.  This really is critical we must always
be sure to distinguish between scientific models and reality.  They represent 
two parallel lines of existence.  Being a(nother?) chemist and mild-mannered 
quantum 'mechanic' (by day, and by night ?) I realize that the ideas of contin-
uum both in science and reality are *IDEALS*, kind of like *VACUUMS*, but not 
severely underpopulated regions, *EQUALITY*, but not fairness or parity, *UNI-
VERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS*, but not coincidence of interprretation or response to 
similar stimuli.  
	The  "we're all just sittin' in a big ol' spider web of interaction" 
idea is useful but it is a lot like tha man in the moon.  We can not explain 
'action at a distance', we cannot see it, but we can and do experience its 
(after)effects.  Hell, in most *GOOD* experiments separability has to be so 
well-defined (in time, phase, space, etc.) and is such a confusing concept that
it is often abandoned and absorbed into another facet of the system and not 
dealt with directly at all.  
	Anyway, before i hot bottom (i guess i've already gone off the deep end
) let me say this.  Separability, separateness, whatever is not necessarily a 
bad or wrong thing.  It's probably not even a *REAL* thing.  I look at it as 
just another 'vibe' that you play in response to your environment.  Just like 
*UNITY* (yet another illusion, but i won't go into that.  yes, you're quite 
welcome!).  I mean, what if separateness and unity are just different aspects 
(responses) of (to) the same stimuli?  Sorta like wave-particle duality, being
described by both but *BEING* neither.  It may not ne a typical way of experi-
encing (Have U ever been experienced?  whoops, sorry for the dreaded Hendrix 
segway!) inasmuch as resulting form a typical/limited way of interpreting or 
expressing that experience.  
O'tay!
	That being done, may i express my ignorance by requesting (only for the
brain-impaired) the meanings of certain of the commonly used acronyms?   Like 
what does IMHO *REALLY* mean?   Geez, here come the hallucinations again! WEEEEEeeee

peace,

For those of you looking for something down in the south bay

Garth, Markie Mark and Harry Who are playing down at Groove kitchen.
It's being put on by Stompy Productions (that's Preston) and Destiny

it is at Martin Avenue (that's One Step Beyond).

I went to a proto-rave in Houston a few weeks ago, and it was kinda 
interesting. It was in a small downtown warehouse and the lightshow 
consisted of..... one red lightbulb. The visuals consisted of...... 
a computer animation video playing on a monitor in a small chill 
room. There were a lot of people there at the beginning, but all 
they did was stand there and drink beer. At the high point of the 
evening, around mid- night, there were at most 25 people dancing.No
real drugs (not alcohol) were in evidence. I can't recall why I had 
so much fun; perhaps it was because the music was good. Apparently 
it was Houston's first such event, so it will be interesting to see 
how the scene there develops.

Subject: Dee Lite @ Townsend


FYI, I called Townsend today to find out about advance tix to Dee-Lite on
Friday.  According to the dude on the phone, no advance tix will be
available -- first come first serve basis only. Doors open at 10PM... we
may want to make plans around this at Derek/Ovid's party on fri nite.

I asked him whether it would sell out and he said "probably". I asked about
ins-and-outs or whether we could buy tix in advance and then come back
later on in the evening -- he said that due to fire-code whatevers, they
wanted to keep a strict control on the capacity so this wouldn't happen.

(I wanted to ask, why not just sell N tickets, where N is the fire-code
capacity limit plus whatever over-limit fudge factor they'd be willing to
deal with, but didn't want to press him on the subject)

Perhaps it's becausew fire code capacities are routinely ignored in SF --
as long as you don't keep a tally of the number of tix sold, you can just
pack 'em in w/o proof.  I know that Slims typically goes 25-50%
over-capacity for big name events, and that they do all sorts of weird
bribes with fire dept. officials so that these infractions get overlooked.
(This info comes from my ex-girlfriend, who is daytime office-manager
there...)

AstroBoy and I had a chance to sample the new, "improved" Top on Tuesday
night.  DJ's Rasoul (from Good Vibe Tribe) and Brennan (from Velvet
Lounge) played hella-funky tunes centered around acid jazz, with sprinklings
of house, "gentle" techno, and deeper hypnogrooves.  Just the right mix
to ignite my somewhat flagging body and spirits.  Brennan's a well-underrated
DJ who spun at my party last January.

As usual with the Top, things were pretty empty until around midnight, but
then took off, crowdwise.  This event should be added to the weekly list.
Check it out, SFRavers!  Two hands up!

Dinner is fine too but I and Elizabet were thinking to a lunch every week
during working hours: would be an excuse to leave school/work/whatever and 
all the people that we usually see there, so that we can have a "live"
interaction with SFRavers.

I mean cyber-interaction is fun but I think we should move on with new
ideas:
	picnic, lunch, dinner, treasure hunt (I remember someone proposed this)
	bike ride and how about movies ??

Anyway you got the idea.

So next week I will post the location and the date of the first "official"
SFR lunch: we will have a map point and .....

	wait a minute I'm talking about a rave, 
	No it'll be just a e-mail.

This is what I am hoping as well...  Gunther went on thursday night and they
were playing reggae/rap, however, and the place was deserted when he showed
up so he left.  I hope it comes back, Thursday couldve been an exception...

I agree this is a good place for a good article to land ... this magazine
also used to be a good leading edge reporter, a place where new
trends or developments were covered first, don't know if that's still
true.

You should do 2 articles, or sidebar the rave article with an article
on music.  The music is accessible to everyone everywhere, even if
no one has developed the scene there.

No, chances are that Tuesday is the exception.  When the Top management
changed a month or two ago, they reopened with a reggae format, from what

gradually.

Subject: my weekend

for those who have been writing in asking what's the name of my record
and where can i buy it, let's go over it one more time:  the band is
ULTRAVIOLET CATASTROPHE, the record is called THE TRIP.  as of right
now, you can NOT buy it anywhere - there are only 25 copies in
existence and all but one of them have been given to DJ's and
distributors.  the last one is in our living room and it ain't going
nowhere.  right now, we're waiting to get a second batch of tests
since we weren't happy with the first one.  if we like the 2nd batch,
we will press up ~ 1000 copies which you will be able to buy at most
dance music stores.  if we don't like it, then we will have to
remaster which will take a while.  keep watching this space for future
announcements concerning the record.

now, here's another installment of the weekend rave report:

saturday - jeff taylor (housemate and UVC-co-conspirator) and I were
offered a chance to do a "live ambient" set at discovery.  i was a bit
skeptical, given that we had no music ready.  also, i'd heard terrible
things about one step beyond (the club in santa clara where discovery
happened).  jeff wasn't even home until noon saturday, so i was in a
king-size panic.  eventually we got our shit together, packed the car
with some hi-tech gear and headed down to OSB.  we set up in the back
room which looked ok as chill space went - pretty large size, nice
visuals, etc.  the sound system was a bit dodgy, but we figured it
would suffice.  WRONG.  wimpy didn't begin to describe it.  they
opened one of the separating doors between the chill space and the
main room and the wimpy sound disappeared under the thudding beat from
the main dance floor.  well, we did our show anyway, despite the fact
that nobody could hear it (except for jeff and myself, who were
listening on headphones), and it seemed to go ok.  the crowd at OSB
was not what i would call particularly ravey - we saw a few fights
break out (FIGHTS!?!?) and the drug of choice seemed to be beer rather
than anything psychedelic.  the music was pretty poor until Spun came
on.  i wish i could've stayed to hear rick preston's set, but i was
falling asleep on my feet, and we had to dismantle the gear and pack
the car...  all in all, i would rate this rave Largely Pathetic.
fortunately, i got in for free.

sunday - another rave in the park.  good to see the SFR contigent in
full effect.  when i got there, the sound system was knackered.  spun
was lounging around waiting for a chance to blow us away, but the
sound guys couldn't figure out which bit of tinfoil had come loose, so
we were basically stuck until 5:30, at which point someone brought in
two cerwin vegas and a small (300 watt) amp.  this got things
underway.  unfortunately, they needn't have bothered because spun
played a load of utter crap.  i know i'm going to get flamed for
saying it, but i just don't like that sort of music (it was mostly old
funk, disco and house).  my crass soul can only understand techno and
acid, so don't bother trying to educate me, all right?

in the "hearing my amazing song played at raves and bugging out"
department: jesse and julius papp played the record at Discovery.
jesse played it at +8 and mixed out during the good bit tho.

I'm just curious, how was the rave on Sunday ??

The Warfield on Saturday was very good, definely better that I was expecting: 
the set-up was just perfect. Did anybody go to the after-party ??

I really like the fact that you could dance behind the DJ and I think
they liked too.
Who was the DJ just before Garth ?

Good visuals and definely a "happy happy joy joy" (this is the title
of a song from "Red and Stimpy") crowd.

SFR lunch:
	I was thinking to Friday in Palo Alto around 12:30ish
	Where? Well, I haven't tought about that yet but it
	doesn't really matter.
	Let say we meet in front of Burger King (University Ave. and
	... I forgot the cross street but I think it's the first
	one after the bridge).

	How do we recognize each other ?? I'll be wearing
	my SFR button and I think it won't be a problem because
	few of us actually know each other.

I skated by there a bit early on Sunday (maybe 2:30PM or so)
luckily before the sound system blew.  I had fun for the
little while I was there, but then I like House (at least to
dance to).  Dancing on roller-blades in the park to house
music (now there's a fad for the 90s) was an interesting
experience overall.  No strobe lights in my face, so I could
actually see everybody.  I was facing my shadow so I was
getting some visual feedback on what my body was doing.  The
grass and dirt interfered with my wheels enough so that I
could actually keep my balance.

I couldn't talk my friends into dumping the rental skates
and coming back, though.  I came back by myself around 5
when the sound was out, and decided to skip it. 

I was looking around for something that looked like an
sfravers crowd... a banner, some badges, maybe a picnic
blanket equipped with powerbooks and cellular phones... but
I didn't see anyone.

at Sunday night's regular rave. Said they were going to charge the owner
with operating after 2am without a cabaret licence. This was one of the
better weekly events around and I assume this will probably kill it off,
as well as the Friday night thing that started up.

So with the Southern District being one of the more violent and highest
crime areas for SFPD, they figured it was more important to send half
a dozen officers and a sargent to shut down some folks dancing at 
a club out in the middle of nowhere ... Guess we're dangerous.

> Anybody go to Evolution......

I went to the Deee-Lite thing at Evolution on Fri, it was total chaos.
We lined up on Townsend for nearly two hours (11-12:45). The people on
the door were idiots, at one point they declared that the line we were
in was now the guest line (it had not been the guest line 2 mins before)
and that we needed to go around the other side, I'm surprised there
wasn't more of a riot.

At 1 they started a drag show?, then about 1:30 Ms. Keir was briefly
seen on stage, did not sing! Dimitri and Towa Towa were on the
turntables, they played "Runaway", Ms. Keir left the stage, the other
two continued to DJ, I hope they never have to do it for a living!

The crowd was pretty rude as well, too much alcohol, not enough e, and
the sound system was distorting.
All in all a waste of $15.

I guess I'll skip the Frankie Knuckles thing this Fri.

In total contrast Carefree (same place) on Sat was brilliant, beautiful
lights, graphics, sound and people. Marky and Nikki played some great
sets.

Subject: our rave - update


	At GG Park I managed to talk to a couple of DJ's to see if and
when they could play for us. I got the most enthusiastic response from
Carlos, who said he'd be happy to do it. Spun said he was interested,
but wants me to call him to find a good time. Thursdays work well, but
it would have to be after August 5th.... Garth said, "Give some of the
smaller DJ's a chance," which I guess was basically a nice way of kissing
us off :):)  So anyways, Carlos and maybe Spun.  I'm going to that thing
in Sacramento this weekend, and there'll be 18 DJ's there I could ask...

	So are any of the people who DJ's for us at the picnic willing
to do this one, too?  You were all great, and you'll have something of
a real audience this time :)  Let me know as soon as possible...

	I found someone who's willing to do sound for us for free. I'm
going to go check his equipment out this week; he said he has 4 cabinets
with 15" and 18" woofers, and two horn systems, plus turntables, mixers,
etc. Sounds cool...

	Also, we sorta came to the conclusion that Thursday night would
be the best night for us; we could get the DJ's without worrying about
too much conflict from other raves, and that's the best weekday night
for us.

	So it's down to some Thursday night in August. Great. We need a name
now....

	Do we want a map point and a voice mail number?  Neither are 
particularly hard to set up; the map point could be open only from, say,
11:30 to 2am, thus whoever's the map point could still go and enjoy it. We
just have to make sure we have it where there are a lot of cars at night
anyways. Maybe two points, one in Santa Cruz and the other somewhere north...
A voice mail box costs $20 to set up, and I'd be willing to handle that.

	Also, does _anyone_ out there have some kool lighting effects they
could bring? We'll provide power. Even something as simple as a few slide
projectors and a color wheel. Or something more elaborate....

In addition to the bust made on Mission Rock I also heard there was a bust on
City Nights on Sunday morning. That was all about a curfew on under 21's after
2.30 or something like that. The police in that case seemed to create a bit of a
stir in order to get a reaction from the people there, seems like they want to
kill the scene off by killing off the fun and scaring some of the people from
coming.

I for one am going up to Sacremento and would urge any others of you that feel
strongly about this to do the same. Let's show them how peaceful and fun these
parties really are. Maybe we can convince the people who matter that this
culture is not something that is against our society but is an enhancement to it.
How can people having fun, being happier and espousing peace be any threat, 
especially in these times of escalating violence.

See you there,

Keep the faith, PEACE.

Terrific!  There goes the best small dance venue in the city (IMHO).

I think it's time for us to tell the powers-that-be just what we
think of their arbitrary harassment of a peaceful dance culture.
Call one or more of the following phone numbers, and let them
know what you think:

	SFPD Southern Station			553-1373
	SFPD Office of Citizen Complaints	553-1407
	Mayor's Office				554-6141

The more of us that call, the more of their time will be wasted
when this and other ludicrous actions take place.  Besides, it
feels better to do something than to sit and stew about it.

Well anyone who reads alt.rave will know how much i was in 
love with the rave that i went to last saturday night
and i really think it would be dribble to repeat it

i'll just say that it was the best rave i have ever gone to
and it managed to get better and better from the time i got there
at 1 am until 7 PM the next night
the most important thing that happened was that people didnt want it
to end so we got some equipment and moved it out to a public park

but the one thing htat i was curious about was what 
the hardkiss bros look like?

i met bones and talked to him and he is a really killer guy
and when he was wearing his shades and spinning he just looked
so perfect, like a guru or something standing there making magic

but i met this other guy from up north who had kinda short blonde hair
that was pretty much spiked up (although im sure a day of dancing and
stuff had had its toll) and he was average height kinda skinny
wish i could get a better description, but i would really like to know who
he is, cuz i forgot to ask

he told me a story about how he met bones and it was something like
he was spinning at GG park and he was the only dj and was running out of
records when this guy walked across the grass with a crate of records
and asked if he could spin 

sounded cool to me, but does anyone know the truth of this or who i was talking
to??

Hooray, Brian... good work so far!  

Instead of a map point we could just give out directions...  my
understanding of the map point thing is it is meant to make an event that
charges $$  appear to be a private party, and this IS a private party, so...
at the fmr they just hit you up as you went in to park... we could do that,
and all take turns so nobody was stuck there all night.  [or how about a
bitmap point!? nerds only!!]

I have a small strobe light...  but I thie should wait on lighting till we

i will probably speak to the head organizer again tonight at a fun little club
thang called FLUID at Malarky's in Sacto.  It only goes until 2 but the atmos-

TOP:
	went to the TOP yesterday and it was definely worth going for $2
(THX MykL). It was already fairly crowded at 11:15 and it started to be 
very crowded around midnight.
Few SFRsvers (Andrea, Jesse, MykL, Derek and another that I forgot).
The music was housy and funky and later the D.J. (who was he anyway??)
played some of my favorite songs (like the one that repeats "all I want to 
do ... is to be with you" over and over). Good crowd overall.

SFR lunch:
	it looks like lots of people are interested so I guess its happening
and it'll be on Friday at 12:30; meeting point in front of Burger King
on University Ave. in Palo Alto (I think the cross street is Webster
but I'm not 100% sure; there is a small plaza with some benches).
Anyway depending on how many will show up we'll decide what and where to eat.

Harmonic Convergence:
	I called this morning and the message said that has been postponed at
the weekend of 7th of August. So I guess this weekend the only two things 
happening, besides ADMIT IT, are devotion and juice.

Tonight I may go to the Housing Project, does anybody know at what time 
is worth to go there ??

Leopolds in berkeley has a limited supply of U.F.Orb on import vinyl for you
vinyl junkies out there in search of post rave chill out music. I listened
to the whole thing last night, and it is MUCH better overall than Beyond the
Ultraworld. They also have Blue Room on vinyl.
Oh yeah, the U.F.Orb that they have is the 2 record edition, not the 3 record
edition (drool drool). Anyway, see rec.music.misc for more about this.

Its like that on the break with a verbal milkshake and a godly vanglorious break

	While I do support the cause of afterhours dancing in Sacremento
( and in San Jose also!) I think there are ALSO a whole slew of other issues
that a rave on the capitol steps should/could also address.  Some of these 
issues are:

	1. The apparent systematic dismantlement of the California
	    education system making it virtually impossible for a poor
	    person, no matter how smart they are, from getting any kind
	    of quality education.  The education budget should not be
	    cut AT ALL!!

	2. The apparent encouragement of Police committed and other
	    types of violence.

	3. The use of scare tactics and violence to prevent people from
	    peacefully and lawfully assembling for enjoyment or protest.

	4. The continued sponsoring of a deceitful and racist "celebration"
	   of the maraudings of Columbus and his gang.

	5. I'm sure you can think of other issues including old growth
	   forests, off shore drilling, housing and homeless issues, etc.

WHAT WE CAN DO
_______________

	Well first of all I want to encourage any actions to be peaceful,
we don't want to have people land in jail unnecessarily or for stupid
reasons.  We don't want to destroy property or get the locals pissed at us.

I think the mode we should use is sorta like what happened at the first
Creation when we cleaned up the beach after we left. (actually we made
it MUCH cleaner then when we arrived). This really impressed the local
people, including the local sheriff.  I know for a fact that they will
have a different reaction when they hear some story about how horrible
ravers are and the horrible things that they do.

While we want to be peaceful we still want to get our point across, some
ways we might do this is through 

	1.self expression (like wild ways of dressing
	  that carries a message)

	2.Posters and signs,

	3.Bring petitions and information to share
	  or that you think other people NEED to know about.

	4.Be civil to the locals.

	5.Be congenial (but not stupid) to the police, often the average
	  cop is NOT a NAZI (although be aware at all times) he or she has
	  been handed a load of shit by his/her superior about ravers and
	  the rave scene.  Try to talk to them a little (I do NOT reccomend
	  doing this if you have warrants or are holding or under the influence)
	  don't tell them anything that they couldn't find out by reading
	  an article in SFweekly but explain the scene to them (don't
	  talk about e or a or acknowledge that this goes on. Just say well
	  some people may use substances but emphasize that this is a pro-life
	  (I`m not talking about abortion here!) scene and we only want to help
	  if people are taking or distributing drugs they are doing it for
	  the sake of awareness not to exploit people (sic). Thing to NOT them
	  are who the e dealers are, locations of raves or rave promoters,
	  labeling certain people as "real ravers" names or addresses especialy
	  where you live.  It's easier to say I live in San Jose when you live 
	  in Berkeley then to tell them you don't want to answer that.

	6. Above all be good to and help out fellow ravers who may be too high
	  or who need a ride or have a flat tire or whatever.  The only way
	  that any of this will have any effect is if we exhibit elements of
	  cohesion and community.

	7. Invite other PEACEFUL non-raver groups to join us.
	  BAD choices are the Crips Bloods or the RCP (revolutionary
	  communist party)
	  GOOD choices are groups like the SF mime troop, those Puppet
	  people that show up a demos on the stilts. (anyone know who
	  they are? Let me know.) Sympathetic people involved in the media
	  and groups like the ACLU (we may need them in the future!)

if you are a compact disc junkie like myself, you can get UFOrb on CD
at Compact Disc Land on University Ave in Palo Alto.  they have a
pretty interesting selection of techno CDs there and the buyer is a
very friendly guy.

i can't understand why you'd want blue room on vinyl when it is
supposed to be an unbroken 40 minute stretch of bliss.  the 17 minute
version on uforb leaves something to be desired as well (another 23
minutes, probably).

i don't like UFOrb better than Adventures either.  they're both fairly
different records.  of course, i'm using the original double import of
Adventures as the yardstick - the american version is an
abomination best not talked about in polite society.

find of the week: check out "Ai" by Hypnotone for some more good
ambient/dancey-yet-relaxing synth grooves.

Leave this out of it, or you'll be laughed away.  This is not an issue that's
anywhere near as pressing as the others, and is not likely to change.

One problem with trying to include all these causes together is that you'll
simply be labeled as "another liberal complainer" or something like that.
People in power have stereotypes of liberals as somewhat clueless people
who all have the same agenda and support any "politically correct" issue
without really thinking about it.  If you try to lump everything together,
you'll just strengthen the stereotypes.

On the other hand if you present one issue (#3 above sounds like what you're
going for), and try to appear as very reasoned people with sound thought
behind your cause, you're more likely to attract their attention.

First of all, let's get one thing straight... First of all, I am not afraid
to be labeled a liberal when I see what the "non-liberals" are doing around me.

Second this is by no meanse any type of Platform or anything, this is still

the things that bother them about the way that the state (state of California
that is) is running things.

Fourth besides, I'm not a liberal, I'm a trouble making radical, and proud of it.

Hey -- I'm not criticizing your viewpoints, positions, political standpoints,
or anything.  For the most part, I agree with them.  I'm simply pointing out
what I think the reality is concerning people in power.  I'm just suggesting
what you might do, and what you perhaps shouldn't do, if you want the atti-
tudes of the state govt. to change.

I stand by my comments about Columbus Day -- perhaps we shouldn't be
celebrating a guy who instigated the downfall of American Indian civilization
and introduced lots of nasty diseases.  However, do you really think it's
of the same importance as environmental destruction, homelessness, drug-
induced fascism, etc.?  If you want the Columbus Day issue changed, I would
think it would be more productive to bring this issue up by itself.  (BTW,
Columbus Day has been around for ages.  Would this issue be coming up if it
weren't for the "500th anniversary" crap?)

(or maybe you're right -- maybe if you try and "blast" them with hundreds of
causes, they'll agree to look at the Columbus Day issue just to make you
go away feeling satisfied that something changed, while they continue to get
away ignoring the real issues)

Okay, okay enough chiding already!  I spoke to Peter who is one of the head
organizers for the ADMIT IT thang and he DOES have all the required permits
to hold the rave/party on the steps of the capitol.  His paperwork allows 
for a function to last from 5pm friday to noon saturday.  UNFORTUNATELY,
he has very recently been contacted by the AUTHORITIES that they STRONGLY 
PREFER that the function STOP at 12pm and resume at 6am.  Since he does have 
all the correct signatures and forms he/we have the LEGAL RIGHT to be there and
do the GROOVE THANG on the specified location.  However, it now appears to be
a good possibility that there may be an interruption - relocation -interruption
-re-relocation process to endure.  On the other hand, he might have legal coun-
sel present to delay/halt this INJUSTICE.  I think all in all the night should 
prove fun and interesting and well worth the drive for you BAPPIES (Bay Area 
Partiers).  If anything more definite should come down the grapevine i'll be

Excellent points and ideas, geoffw!  Particularly how to talk to the cops,

If we are a community, what is our responsibility to others in our community

What [if any] "political" views can we say are shared?
I'd say definitely anti-rascist, or perhaps simple tolerance of individual
differences - I frequently see tshirts expressing this.  In a way, we've

in my admittedly rather off-the-cuff opinion, _tribes_ are usually
formed for protection.  community emerges without conscious "forming";
community is the sense that one does not have to guard one's self from
others *within* the community.  not so much banding together to ward
off outsiders.  within a "community", one is "at home."

normals>>What [if any] "political" views can we say are shared?

dear normals, in my rather harshly critical opinionated nature, you 
have cautiously identified about the only opinion I would be willing 
to concede I agree with.  congratulations.  I'm sure you're elated.

okay, wait just a minute.
I love to see political discussion in this forum,
but I would plead with you all to avoid "grouping"
us together.  I do not want to be affilitated with
a political action committee.  call me a grouch, I don't care.
but please, don't bring political party affiliations into this.
just as most anti-abortionists would claim to be "pro-choice"
( for the fetus, of course ), most, if not *all* republicans
will claim to be Anti war.

I attend raves because sometimes they're fun.
I have political opinions because sometimes they're ethically useful.
I've yet to be convinced that rave-0-mania is vehicle for
	social and political change.  perhaps we attend raves
	because we share a certain degree of tolerance and a desire
	for a more tolerant world.  what brings us to raves is 
	perhaps what takes us to sacramento, what inspires us

 Hello Everyone! I have a music request, that is inspired by an altered-

"heavenly" choir on it (definetly not "O FORTUNA"), that I began to dance to
in a tight circle ( I was trying to do a whirling dervish move ). To my 
surprise and delight, I was quite transported! I believe the strobes helped
too.

 Anyway - can anybody recommend any techno/rave music with choirs in it - with
the qualifier that "O Fortuna" kind of singing is NOT what I'm after. I think
"O Fortuna" is too choppy and doomy for my purposes.

 ( Maybe it's a flashback to my Catholic religious upbringing :-/ !!! )

Subject: Regarding shared values..

  Well, it's an interesting question,trying to divine the slender thread
of shared consciousness and value that ties 'ravers' together...
Well, I suppose you get as many answers as there are ravers..
Maybye it's roots are in the ecstasy of the dance..the shared experience
of having the rhythm slice through our inhibit-shins- rendering certain
parts of us into jelly...There's more than a bit of desire for transcendence..
not death,but some kind of breakthrough...maybye by going faster and faster..
It's what we grew up on...multiple inputs...House music is just the logical
expansion of a lifestyle that frequently involves listening/watching/interacting
with numerous separate loops running simultaneously..We who use the net represent
another aspect of this new life form, the first to extend this culture into
the matrix that will inevitably become cyberspace..Although this change seems dizzying
perhaps evolving trends in international rave/computer (cyberfunk?) culture
will recognise the need for balance and execute downsizing...
Certainly the first manifestation of that is the trend towards ambient/chill
culture within rave-dom, and the respect for earth based religions..
It seems as if rave culture has lost some of it's edge and gained a little
maturity..

avoid it.  if you see a rave organized by the sharon people, run the

Im sorry, but i really dont see a reason for any of those to be something
on a list of shared "'political' views"

You dont have to be pro-choice to be the kind of caring
open person i like to meet at raves, and you dont
really have to be a pacifist, a lot of parents
would fight for their children and i dont hold that against them
as far as not being a republican...
well i dont necesarily agree with a lot of republican or democratic
politics, but that doenst mean i am anti-either

i really dont think that there is a political stance that even
_my_ 'ideal' group of ravers could hold
except maybe something like get these damn police off our backs
we are just trying to have fun
or maybe legalization of LSD and MDMA and Nitrous or something
but even then...

social change is more what i would expect from a group of ravers
causing people to care...
as far as flower children stuff goes... maybe ravers tend
to be like that because they are on a lot of the same drugs
and we have more X so people feel even more 'loving' about
each other

i really wish i could afford to go up to admit it and help support the 
cause, but the cause needs to be trying to stop this negative attitude
that the press and gov't have about raves from going to the public

BE FRIENDLY, BE OPEN, let people see that we arent a bunch of
deranged drug addicts who just care about dancing and sex and drugs

show them that we are trying to create a community where we
can all BE

Quick report on last night's activity...

I went to Gamma first; at about 1 am there were only about 50 people there.
They had moved it back to the top floor where Osmosis had been; actually
I don't even know if they still call it Gamma.  I stayed about 1/2 an
hour, during which things didn't really pick up.  I happened to be
wearing a black shirt, so I wandered over to Drug #6 for my leather
and mascara fix (seemed to be the usual crowd).  At about 3 I wandered
back to Gamma which hadn't gotten any bigger.  So Gamma seems to be
a failure.

Deep Faith still seems to be the place to go - I went over there after
Gamma hoping they weren't checking the door anymore (I had already paid
two covers).  Unfortunately they were, but there were quite a few
people going in and out, looked like a good crowd.  Maybe next week...

	Yeah, Pete and I arrived around 10:30 to find about 150 people still
milling around, and the sprinklers on in the grassy area where I guess people
had been dancing :)  They said it had shut off around nine, and people held
in their hands this purple invite to that afterparty at 13th and C. So we
headed over there to find 3 punk bands playing there.... but at around 
midnight the punks were kicked out (I hear they even had to leave before the
headlining band got on!! A couple of the punks were taunting the ravers,
saying stuff along the lines of "where's John Travolta" :)

	Four police cars showed up, so I wandered over to where the organizers
were talking to the cops, saying they had the permits and such, and the cops wee
debating about weather to let them proceed or not.  The Felix promoters were
there (I recognized one of them because when they were the "Utopia Experience"
promoters we interviewed them on "Techno Attack") and they place was litteres
with Feel-X flyers.  Taking a clue that this may not be such a hot event, and
not wanting to get worked into a frenzy only to have it shut down at two, I
caught word of another event at 16th and D (I LOVE Sac's streets!:), so we
went there.

	This was great - a true, illegal, small, back-room warehouse rave.
Admission was $5, the DJ's, even though they were relatively unknown, were
great (One may do our beach rave for us), the crowd never exceeded about
50 on the dance floor, but those who were there were friendly, and best of
all the cops never showed up :)  This isn't something I'd want to go to
every weekend, but it was a nice break from the all-legit clubs and
masses of "Jive" t-shirts.  And I met as many people there as I do at any
other rave...

	Even the smart drinks were free!

	It certainly brought back memories of LA from 3 years ago...


	Sorry I missed everyone else at 13th and C...

Subject: RE: Sacra-bomb-t

Argh!

The rumor we heard was that the other place was at 16th and C, or
perhaps my bad hearing was at it again.  So, I drove to 16th and C,
only to find the Blue Diamond almond factory.  One block and we
would have been at 16th and D; I should have known that what Malachy
found out must have more resemblance of truth than I knew.  Unfortunately,
my natural instincts to talk to more people were sidetracked since the
people I was with didn't want to get into any trouble with the police,
which I generally have little or no fear of (hell, I've been in juvie
hall before, but that wasn't because of the sherrif, it was because of
the people who prosecuted me!  The sherrif was the nicest person
I had to deal with in that >entire incident<!  Mumbles about something
to do with growing up in a place where the police were to be trusted and
helped us rather than fearing them.)

But, there was an old PG&E building near the river which made up for
all that; I can describe it more as an abandoned castle.  It had a
great big chasm underneath with lots of space down there, this stairway;
and ceilings for the rooms went at least 20 feet high in half the places
and 50 feet in the rest.  It was a great big cement structure with lots
of nooks and crannies.  It had a wonderful window out to a ucalytous tree
(near I-5) on one side, it was set in a field, and some big (major) river
on the other.  It was absolutely wonderful!  (You couldn't see the river
from the castle, but it was there and you knew it since you had to walk
along it to get there.)  The air was very warm (remember, this is the
central valley in summer,) and the people were quite nice.  They brought
candles, and we were the first people in.  It was really fun lighting
candles that spread so little light that you couldn't see the walls.
You knew that was bigger than you could tell, and you were never
sure whether you would fall in a hole unless you stared at the ground where
you were about to step for quite a few seconds.  Finally, a bright lantern
was lit by one of us, and I decided to defy the organizer's wishes and bring
the lantern down into the exposed part of a pit in the center of the
building:  this twenty foot drop had maybe a ceiling above it maybe 60 to
70 feet above, so the lantern sort of lit that up in a neat way, while
providing very visible notice of the hole
 (a constant danger -- someone
could easily slip and fall off the egde, there was nothing to stop your fall
except the cement structures 20 feet below which you couldn't really see.)
Meanwhile, the lantern stopped lighting up the areas which didn't need
to be lit up, so darkness and light were distributed in a very nice way.

Only, there were no DJs and big music boxes.  I told the guy who was there
(perhaps from San Jose?) about the fact that there >are< adequate generators
made which are so quiet that you can put them next to the dancers and the
dancers won't even hear them (remember the FMR?  The generator was >next to<
one of the speakers.)  The worst problem are the fumes, so it would still
make sense to leave the thing outside and run a cord.

If we had known about 16th and D, I wouldn't feel like killing you, Brian.
But that's ok, it's my lesson too, since I ought to have known to look at
a map for an area I've never driven before.  I know Sacramento freeways
better than Berkeley freeways, and, well, following directions exactly can
sometimes put oneself quite out of the way.

All in all a mixed evening.  I have wonderfully vivid dreams the night after,
so I think it was all worth it!  It was weird, the dreams I had ... I can't
quite remember them, all I remember is being rescued by a helecopter
which happened to fly over an airplane which was inconvenient because of
the air-current pulling the helecopter near to the airplane, so we stood
on the airplane while we were waiting for the helecopter to break free
(dream physics are quite interesting I might add,) but I realized that
physics laws weren't quite being followed at the same time as the two
broke free, so the dream obeyed and I had this wonderful fall at a 100 degree
angle from the direction of gravity (yes, I was going up! towards the clouds!
It was totally awesome!) all the way to a certain island, where I got so
confused about where I had to land that I slowed down in the dream to a
safe speed (I was thinking so hard) and landed running!  It's the first
dream I've had which wasn't in black in white in my life, I think; I
remember vivid blue skies and green trees, blue ocean, mountains,
buildings, people.  This is all after I saved this head's life -- oh never
mind.

I love the recent discussions about dreams and the concept that that's a way
to index the information one has to store, etc. that have been popping up
here and on Granola (@BrownVM.Brown.Edu -- a ListServ site.)

Ulmo

P.S. I'm still interested in doing a research project (it would take that
much!) to see what it would do to make a legal rave in each City and County.
It must be quite a bear to figure out; there are quite a few laws to be
obeyed, and many different permits to be got; I wonder what they all are.
Does anyone have a good pointer?  Is there a "Parties and Clubs Dept" I can
go to in SF to ask?

Well, we decided to skip all the excitement in Sacramento and check out
Evolution at Townsend for a low key, non-hyped night of dancing.  Well,
it turned out to be *very* low key.  Small crowd, no smart bar, and the
upstairs chill out area was closed.  Bored security made us put out our
funny cigaret as we awaited what was supposed to be the big event of the
evening, the arrival of Frankie Knuckles (I think that was the name).
An announcement was made about how Evolution was now going to be called
something else, I forget what, and how there is no club in all of S.F.
dedicated to House music - until now.  Knuckles took over the turntable
and gave us some House, basically techno minus the cool sounds and samples,
played at a slower tempo, with cliched vocals.  IMHO, boring.  The
highlight of the evening was the appearance of Genesis P-Orridge on
the dance floor outfitted head to toe in psychedelia performing simulated
sex with a female in a blue metallic beaded dress.  It was a colorful
display.

Subject: The first ever SFRaves survey!


	Hi all.  I was looking back over the list of subscribers, trying to
attach names to addresses, when I realized that I know or have met only a
fraction of you out there.  (Maybe in your mind this is a good thing? :) 
It's also hard to get an idea of what kind of community this really is unless
most if not all voices are heard expressing themselves and their opinions. So,
I thought it would be interesting to put a survey out to see what people out
there are really thinking. 

	I didn't spend TOO much time on the questions; I simply put down what
I was interested in finding out. If you think a few of the questions are 
poorly written or confusing, let them stand, just write to me and I'll fix
them or remove them for the next survey (3 months from now? 6 months?).  I'd
like to keep conversation about the survey off the list until I get all the
replies and post the results; lord knows there's enough sfraves traffic
already.

	Try to send in your reply within two weeks.  You don't HAVE to reply
to every question, of course, but to stay statistically significant it would
be nice. I'd like to get feedback from at least 75% of you. I will be deleting
individual replies after tallying the totals, and I won't add references if
I use your quote (unless you want me to). I will ensure privacy.

	Okay, here goes!  Have fun, kids!

It occurs to me that several of us here on SFR have talked about
checking out Deep Faith (including your humble narrator) but haven't ever
gotten around to it.  Which is slightly embarrasing, since the Hardkisses
turned up at our picnic back in May and spun wickedly for us, and are
such uplifting souls in general...

So how about as many of us as possible descending that staircase at
9th and Howard this Thursday night -- the old Underground, a.k.a.
Lipps (depending on how far back ya go  ;^) ?

No need to RSVP, but the more of us who post that we're going,
the more others of us will show up out of curiousity.  Make sense?

Subject: re: how was devotion? + other stuff

Devotion sounded good from the people who were there that I saw, but
that wasn't really solid evidence this time.  Near the San Juaquin River,
the description from those who went sounded pretty close to the good
setup that you can imagine on a lake.  All this driving to Sacramento
(I drove there and back again today for the State Board of Education
meeting as well as Friday,) and I didn't even detour down to Devotion!
(Of course, costs and all that.)

Deep Faith, both times I've gone and there were people there appropriate
to the cause, I've liked it.  There have been a few times when people
there weren't appropriate, there weren't any people there, and/or the
organizers/DJs weren't there (i.e. no Deep Faith that night.)  But, 
I have very good memories from the few times I went.  I guess the roaming
slash cyclacle nature of night life seems to be giving Deep Faith a good
time recently.

I've sort of gathered that Care*Free is no longer any good, from a visit
I made to the door this last Saturday (ewwww!  I was disgusted by the people
at the door,) and comments from Jessica (pigmented woman with a wand);
however, I haven't gone in recently so it's hard to tell
(plus I didn't check later when it usually gets better.)

Many thanks to those who went with me to Sacramento Friday for making
it possible.

I was on a cable car talking to some lady who started her tours for this
area at Big Sur and worked her way up (what a wonderful way to do it!).
That gave me ideas of course; what about Big Sur?  Just get a Green Tortoise
or something cool like that, have a really wonderful ride on down, and then
have a rave in B.S.  Now, hiding it would be one >major< problem, but god it
would be beautiful.  Perhaps I just ought to go to the next northernly rave.
P.S. I like the DJs who are rumored to DJ at The Top on Tuesdays.

Subject: Re:  Ho was Devotion?


I went to Devotion last Saturday and had an incredible time.  

The phone message from earlier in the week said that the place would
be less than an hour from San Jose.  It turned out to be up North 
in this little farming town a little pass Tracy, about an hour and a
half away (about an hour if you drove relaly fast, I guess).  It was
on this ranch by a lake.  There was lots of open space for parking, so
I don't think that was a problem.  We got there around midnight. 
The cops were there on the road, but they didn't break it up.

There were two sound systems set-up.  On one side of the lake they had 
a small set-up where they were pumping up some house music.  There 
weren't many people on that side, so we deicded to head for the other
side of the lake and wound up staying there the whole time.  I hear that
this area also became the sight for a drum circle later - sorry I missed
that.

The 'techno' side was really happening.  It was on this nice plateau that
was slightly elevated from the shoreline, surrounded by four or five
speaker stacks.  Off to one side, there was an area level with the 
shoreline that served as a smart drink and hang out area.  There was 
a little pier to chill out on and watch the waves go by.

The crowd was friendly - I met up with some old friends and made a few
new ones.  The music was pretty cool - osciallting between techno and
housier grooves - at one point incorporating festive salsa and
caribbean style music.  (I'm really bad at keeping track of DJs, so
I have no idea who was spinning at what time.)  It was a nice clear night,
so you could chill and stare up at the starry sky.  Not too chilly, I
only needed a sweatshirt to keep warm.  

Since this was my first ourdoor rave, I was totally awstruck at how beautiful
the sunrise was.  The vibes were positive, and watching everything come to
life in the morning light was a wonderful feeling.  It was great to see
all the people I had been hanging out with in full daylight.

The music continued to kick through the morning - some wailing diva and
smooth house grooves brought us into the late morning.  We stayed
until 11am, just hanging out with friends.  There were still around 50-60
people nging out and dancing as we left. 

All in all, it was a great time.  As of late, I've been going to more
weekly club action, so I've been craving something a little different.
This hit the spot.  If anything, I'm going to try to make it a point
to go to more outdoor raves!  The only thing I disliked was the $20 cover.

Well, the reason rave DJs don't use CDs is that most of the music they
play is only available on vinyl.  A lot of the smaller rave labels don't
put out CD5s, and most compilation CDs have music that has already been out
on vinyl for many months, and the mixes are often 3-minute edits.

this is one of the reasons why cds are not very useful to djs. in the fast paced world
of dance music there is never, ever anything that will be on cd and not on vinyl. it
is just cheaper to press limited edition remixes on vinyl than on cd. good thing too or
the record company's would have pulled the plug on all forms of vinyl by now.

However, the biggest reason why djs use records is the ability to change the speed/queue songs 
in order to match beats. Unfortunately, too many djs try too hard to show off their skills with the fader and forget that if the song is rubbish to start with, well you can't do
much with it. shit is shit no matter how you cut it. as a retired, old dj that is still a 
vinyl and cd junkie, i like my new breed of djs plastered, reckless and with a sense of humor. I despise the self importance and pretention some djs exhibit while play basically monotonous reactionary shit. sadly, the whole techno culture (players & dancers) seems to have a short memory of the history behind this whole movement. i do not want to drag skeletons out of closet, but i wish there would be more color in this musical landscape.

think about it, for every song that you hear and like, there are four or five that you
would have liked but will never hear. there is so much great music in the world. there
are so many folks in small basements that are making exciting music. 
the best dj's are the evangelical ones. instead of wondering about a catchy nickname or
having big font on a flyer, they should be daring, playing new things every week.

Subject: Rave Update II (please read!)

First off: LAST CALL FOR FLYERS!  

Second:  Thanx to the 35 people who've sent survey replies so far... and to
the others _please_ send 'em in, even if you're a "lurker".  The replies
have been interesting, definitely....




	Just thought I'd tell y'all about how plans are going for the SFR rave.

DJ's: 
	Carlos is still a yes, I just talked to him tonight.

	For those of you who went to the picnic in May, you may remember a 
certain Edan Cassidy.  He said he'd love to do the rave too. In my opinion he 
was as good as the Hardkisses.

	And then our own Jon Druckman offered to DJ.

	So that makes 3 confirmed DJ's for the night.

	I am still working overtime on finding more - I'm trying to get in
touch with Amos and Andy productions in Sacramento, because a particular
DJ there, Boy Wonder, did an outstanding job and I'd like to get him for
our event, but I lost the number he gave me. (AAAGH!) If anyone can provide
some leads I'd be most joyful.  Spun is still wavering... I think if I'm
REAL diplomatic I can pull it off, but I can't promise too much.  If anyone
can provide leads on other SF DJ's like Markie Mark or Dutch or Noel or
Josh or something, please get in touch with me.  At this point I don't think
it'll be too much trouble to get enough DJ's, but only if I finalize the
commitments soon.

Next point: Date.  
	Thursday, August 20th is what I'm shooting for, and so far both Carlos
and Edan are cool with that (dat okay, Jon?)  Spun also spins on Thursday 
night but that ends at 2, so he said if we had someone willing to drive him
from San Jose and back he'd be willing to do it, maybe . So now I just have to
work it out with whoever else we ask;  I think we pretty much decided Thursday
was the best night of the week to do it, and I want to hold it before the end 
of summer.


Location:
	Bonny Dune is 99% bust free and 100% confiscation free.

	A couple SC people have been checking the beach out at night, and told
me (credit goes to paul@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.us and eyethink@cse.ucsc.edu
that while the cops may and often do ticket cars along the highway, they
rarely come over the ridge to the beach.  I know from visiting there that you
could easily have 1000 people there, amplified sound, and if there were no
cars on the highway the cops wouldn't even think twice.  There's never been
a record of police confiscating anything other than alcohol (which we could
probably ban from the party anyways), and even so there are no signs on the
beach, so they have no legal precedent for any intrusive action (unless a
riot breaks out or something). 

	There is parking for about 100 cars up Bonny Doon road, which is
not ticketed, so if people carpooled we could have 500 people arrive by
that.  There is a small risk of vandalism, but with that many people there
I doubt anything would happen.

	One idea that was proposed, that I initially discounted but after
doing some research now think is a great idea, is to have a bus running from
Santa Cruz (where street parking is free and legal) to the site, about 9
miles north.  I called some bus charter companies, and for 10 hours (I told
them 11PM to 9am) a 47-passenger bus would cost $530.  I envision this:
have one bus (maybe 2?) start from SF around 11 arriving at the beach ~12:30.
After unloading everyone, start shuttle service from SC to the beach. The
turnaround time would be ~35 minutes per bus. Then around 7:30 the bus would
leave for SF. How does that sound?  If we have two buses we could have
a constant shuttle service.

	Here's how the economics would work: charge everyone who would use
the bus $15 for the round trip from SF to the beach and back. We instantly make
back the initial outlay for the buses. Then, instead of asking for donations
at the party, ask for $5 (maybe $10) for the bus ride from SC to the beach
(and make the return free).  Finally, ask the people who park on Bonny
Doon road for a $5 donation (like have someone at the entrance to the road. 
Collecting money. Justify this by providing protection against vandals) I
know a very reliable someone who's also a bouncer for Warfield shows who
could serve both jobs for not too much $$.

	I know this sorta detracts from the idea of a completely free rave;
but I'm doing this in the interests of protecting our collective butt and 
keeping people from getting $30 parking tix.  And besides, the idea of a
"rave bus" sounds _really_ cool to me!  We could blast techno music in
it and drape banners... 

	The initial outlay of $530 is harsh, and two is even worse, but if we
could get payment for it ahead of time I could handle it easily.  The bus
company (these are nice luxurious buses, btw, and everything is included in
that price) needs to have the reservations made about 10 days in advance, but
the payment on the bus only needs to be made 3 days in advance. So if we got
47*2=94 people willing to pay $15 apiece to get transported, we'd be more
than covered for two buses.

	If this idea is looney let me know... also let me know if you like
it... further, let me know if you'd be willing to go by bus and how many of
your friends want to go. If I get a sizeable number, I'll make it official.


Sound system:

	Sound will be provided from someone I met at a rave, his name is Derek,
and he is really keen on the idea (as long as he gets a partial share of the
profits, if any).  He has: 2 double-18" woofer cabinets, 2 15" midrange JBL
cabinets, and two mid-high Cerwin Vega cabinets, and several hundred watts of
power.  He said he set their system up in the Edge in Palo Alto and was able to
completely fill it with sound for show at a fraction of their total power. 
Sounds good.  I'm going to go hear it for myself this weekend, and I'll report
back then.  Also, Dave Leland, the guy whose sound system was donated to "ADMIT
IT", said he may want to help too, so if Derek's system isn't enough the
combination of the two may do.  Also, Derek has the turtables & mixer, and
some signal processing stuff like what I've seen other DJ's carry around with 
them. Hopefully it'll be clean and loud....

Visuals: 

	Here's where we need the most help; so far no one has come forward
yet and offered anything more than a strobe light.  Many would say we don't
need visuals, but I really strongly feel that a few projections would really
add something.  I don't expect people to offer to bring their $3000 computers
onto the sand (although I might bring mine and run Fractint :) but a few 
slide-projectors-and-color-wheels or a film loop projector would do nicely.
The cliffs surrounding the beach are just TOO COOL not to do something like
this.
	Also, I checked and there's a place offering front-projection TV 
projectors for $100 a weekend.  If we hook that up to a VCR with some trippy
visuals (or maybe a video camera for feedback?), we'd have a great show.
I have at least one video tape chock full of computer animation, and I 
remember Graham had a cool one too.


Flyers:
	Okay, just so we're all on base with this, I'm assuming we want to
open this up to the public, not trying to get the ToonTown-style crowd
but more like the Gathering crowds or better yet the Come/Unity crowds.
So with that in mind, I was thinking about printing up some small, double-
sided flyers, with the name of our rave on it, the DJ's, and maybe hint
at the location. And of course, the obligatory voice mailbox phone # (it's
only $20, I'll cover that).  In the voice mail number (maybe on the flyer?)
we'll mention a little bit about the bus situation.  I figure I could squeeze
all that info onto a 4"x3" flyer and get several hundred printed up here at
home on flourescent paper for next to nothing.  Then we could hand them out
at the smaller events throughout the next couple of weeks.  Sound okay?

	I've also been working on a new SFR button design. a cool idea came
to me last night.... I'll let you know when the new design makes its way to
the /sfraves directory....


I guess that's it for now.... as far as the name goes, I'm still tallying
votes for names, and as cheesy as it is, "Conn-X-Tion" is winning, and we
can put below it "Turn on, Log In, Reach Out" and "A Huge....".

Any comments, please let me know....

	Brian

I volunteer to set up a map point...I live right by alamo park so that would be
a convenient place for the embarcation (hop right on 101, etc...).  We could
have it so the map point closes at 12:30 with the last bus, and I could hop 
it to the rave.  I estimate a bus leaving SF would get to Bonny Doon beach
before 2 if it left at 12:30.
	This would be the coolest scenario...Gunther and I do the map point
thing, and any sfravers that live in the Haight-Ashbury area (Chris? Andrea?) 
that were so inclined join us at alamo park.  We could have fun running the 
map point until the last bus left, then close up and go on the last bus.
We get there, rave til morning, etc...

I'll defend you on this one before someone inevitably attacks you.  At the small
quantites that a small label would press (less than 1000), CDs cost about 50%
more to produce than vinyl.  The whole deal about CDs being cheaper to produce
than vinyl is only true when the quantity produced is in the tens of thousands.

This is now possible on CDs as well.  The technology just hasn't gained
popularity yet.  Give it a few more years, and you will see DJs mixing with CDs.

I'd say DJ Spun is pretty good at playing new and different things.  He does
seem to play some things over and over and over again, but he also plays a lot
of stuff that you would never expect to get played at a rave (MC 900 Ft Jesus,
David Sylvian & Holger Czukay).

Mike presented the idea that many of the smaller rave labels produce vinyl
only, and nobody does CD only.  I believe that Suck Me Plasma! does only CD's,
but am not positive about this.  I do suppose that I may have to wait a month
or more for some of the good stuff from smaller labels to hit the silver, but
at the same time, isn't it a kind of screening process?  Some other local DJ
friends have started buying a lot of vinyl from obscure techno labels, and I
must say I haven't heard a bigger load of shit in my life.  Tracks like
"Godzilla is in NYC" just SUCK.  When I tell Prime Cuts to send me $200 of
stuff on CD, I feel fairly secure in the fact that even if they send me
something they've never heard, that it won't be too doggy because it has made
its way to CD.  Of course, there are exceptions to this rule.

With the Denon 2000 twin deck, you have the ability to do +/-8% pitch control,
just like a turntable.  What bothers me about this (and I've discussed with
with Jon) is that with digital processing, they can do speed changes WITHOUT
changes in pitch.  Whenever someone picks this ball up on a CD deck is the day
I sell my 2000.  As for cueing, you can cue to 1/75th of a second, not only
does this allow you to precisely hit a beat, but this resolution is so sharp
that you could hit the beginning, end, or somewhere in the middle of a drum
beat.  I've found that a typical beat lasts about 5/75ths of a second.  There
is no way that you can tell me that you can be that accurate with a slip mat
and a turntable.

The cueing function also allows you to return to a cue point almost
instantaneously.  This is like having a sampler with indefinite length on
board.  At the last rave, I was using it to rip vocal samples (there's a great
one on the Technoline comp from George Bush's inauguration) and paste them
over what was currently playing.

There never was any "cyberpunk" culture.  As near as I can tell, the
whole thing was, like the suburban punk thing and the suburban hippie
thing (and the suburban biker thing, etc. through time immemorial) was
a media construct.  What's scary is how some people buy into that
image wholeheartedly.  I still laugh out loud when I remember an article
I read in an allegedly "underground" newspaper about the secret life
of the cyberpunk who talked about "jacking in" (at 300 baud no less!
this was 1988-1989) to a BBS while listening to industrial music and
drinking Jolt Cola (vile stuff by the way).  In much the same way that
the straights got into hippie culture through HAIR (written by a
couple of hacks and a guy who professed to know nothing at all about
rock music), it would seem that people are or have been striving for a
"cyberpunk" aesthetic based entirely on going to glorified barn
dances, taking overpriced drugs and reading really bad sf novels
that rehash boring old ideas in tedious ways.

Say, what exactly is an "organic, evolutionary matrix" anyway (I've
noticed that CP types seem to have bled the word "matrix" of virtually
all meaning).  Which "CP concepts" have trickled down to the
mainstream anyway?  Virtual reality?  I envision a nation of virtual
shut-ins equiped with Leggy Supermodel sex software.

They make up for it by consuming more than their share of overpriced
drugs, overpriced techno compilations and dippy clothes.

I hate to sound too cynical here, but realistically speaking, I don't
see the rave thing as the begining of any sort of new way of
life.  It may be a wonderful, sharing, loving experience for all and
sundry, but ask yourself - am I going to be doing this in 5-10 years?
Now if you really do see yourself staying with this for the long
haul and trying to change the world, then you have all the blessings
of heaven, 'cos sincerity counts for everything these days.

My admiration for true outlaws, technological and otherwise, who live
a life they love outside of the mainstream and the law without
hurting anyone else, knows no bounds.  But little of what I've seen in
the various manifestations of CP culture demonstrates this.  For every
genuine free-thinker and kind-mad hacker soul I've met, I've met 50
losers who think ripping people off is somehow justified if it's done
through technological means.  

The standard line I've liked lately to characterize the "cyberpunk
culture" is this:

"You think you're jacking in, but you're just jacking off"

I have no idea who originally came up with that one, but my hat's off
to him/her.

Hey, Joel, we were at devotion too!  The dj playing salsa/soca music was
Carlos - if you hear him again you should try to get where you can see him,
cuz he is really fun to watch!  He dances and leaps around [between changing
stuff] and really gets the crowd going.

The other side of the lake was the soul side and we went over there around 3
or 4 and hung out there till the sun rose and the dj quit.  the visuals were
EXCELLENT over there, too bad it was so far from the other side that not
many people hung out there.  The laser was way better, very op-art trippy
stuff, projected over film loop/slide projector/colorwheel visuals that were
also stellar.  Also the dj, whoever he was, was sharp.

re the $20 cover, yeah, we found out later that it was the easiest rave EVER
to sneak into!  Oh well, supporting the djz and all that...  we couldnt have
snuck in anyway, we brought a huge cooler and a little pup tent. [we were by
the smart bar].

Anyway, good vibe, great music [did I mention how killer Carlos was?  Garth

"I'll see what I can do."

I often add, "It might take me a while to get to it." That's usually for
the flow breaking requests.

My keys are:
1) Treat the person with respect.
2) Let them know you're working and don't have a lot of time.
3) Don't spend a lot of time on them. Mixing is work. It takes
concentration. If you dilly around with someone you will definitely fuck
up.
4) Don't feel bad if you make someone really persistent wait a while before
you talk to them.
5) If you have a gameplan for the next 3 or so songs, don't change it just
to handle a request, unless you're damn sure. 
6) If the floor is really packed go with your current flow at all costs.
7) Temper these keys with the knowledge of who's paying the bill.

My ultimate goal is to get the person away from the booth/table as soon as
possible so I can get back to mixing. Then in my spare moments I can
consider the possibility of the request. Sometimes I've done my most
inspired work handling a request but I needed space to lay out what I was
going to do with it. Nothing is worse than having people hovering over you.

Note that this problem can be highly diminished by a number of factors:
1) Making sure that people who hire you know your style exactly and like
it.
2) Forcing requests through a funnel person. Typically one of the
organizers. This also allows you to offload the decision making to them.
"It's your party, tell me how you want it to go."
3) Making it hard to get to the table to make requests. I've known DJ's who
would ring the table with chairs a yard away, and then have a lackey patrol
the range making sure people don't get through.

Finally, most importantly
4) Kick ass mixes that keep everyone on the floor. If they're dancing,
they can't be making requests.

It's taken 5 months for Sonz of a Loop Da Loop Era to appear on CD, long after
it was past its prime here in SF.  And I have yet to see "Bombscare" by 2
Bad Mice on CD yet. Lotsa others... TD5 so far is vinyl-only... also, that
really great mix of "Close Your Eyes" by Acen is also finally on CD, but the
_took_out_ the great Beatles "Here Comes the Sun" sample!!  And I doubt the
techno version of "Hey Jude" will ever come out. 

I have both Twitch CD3 and vinyl 4 and 5 (essentially the same songs) and I
much prefer mixing with the vinyl to the CD, even with my pitch-control CD
player. I dunno, there's just something about physically having your hand

To all-

        I'm an 18 year old new SFrave member who has never posted
before, and I must say i'm PSYCHED for this whole bus/beach/rave
thing.  I will personaly bring a few people, so count this as an RSVP
for ~4, Brian.
        I know that the "underground" image is becoming appealing to
many as the crowds get more and more dissapointing at the big SF
parties.  I went to Juice, for instance... I dug the DJs and the
lights, but the people where somewhat of a letdown.  So I'm with you,
Brian, on that flyer design you mentioned - hopefully we can draw
enough of the kind of people we want :-).
	Speaking of Juice last Friday... I got there late because I
had been driving to Sacto and back.  All I got out of _that_ experience
was some friction with the state police and a sobriety test.
Apparently I had parked illegaly, but at least I was sober so the cop
let me off (whew).  WHICH brings me to my main concern about the beach
thing: is it really 90% bust proof?  Will all of the cars in the
vicintity give us away?  How can we keep people from parking where
they will get tickets and the cops will find us for sure?  I don't
know the area, so maybe I'm worrying needlessly, but we all know what
a bummer the *cops* could make this situation.
	ABOUT DJing CDs: I like the concept, but I've never heard it in practice before.  Pete, let us know when you will be DJing on your Denon setup in public cause I'd like to hear.

	Thats all...   Looking forward to meeting some of you in person,

yeah.  i appreciate pete ashdown's description of a drumbeat lasting
over five frames of pause on a CD, but when you've got that needle on

alas, here we go again. first of all, matching beats/queueing are not the only thing
that goes into using turntables. the basic argument in the cd vs. vinyl debate is the
question of ease/percision of cds, as opposed to the feel/warmth of the sound on vinyl.
this carries over into realm of djs. above your are telling me about what sounds like
a Robo-DJ: "Yeah, i can do this, i can match that, i can smaple this" while the best
djs in the world are the ones that care about the music and are creative in content
not just technique. I had intentionally shifted the argument to reflect this. trust me
a dj would impress me much much more by playing truly great music, exposing my ears
to a new sounds, demanding me to listen than by jerking off on the mixer. Is a silky blend
of Paula Abdul with Color Me Badd better than crashing an Orbital tune with New Fast
Automatcic Daffedoils. Even beyond this, as a dj, i have many times walked over and kissed
my fellow djs because of the message the were trying to mesh with songs, because each new
tune made me smile and understand. obviously, that is a much harder task with wordless techno.
djs are so much like cooks, and i like a well seasoned meal rather than a big pot of boiled
potatos.

But i think a source for djs cowardice is one of oldest principles in dance music: most people do
not dance to music they have never heard before. and i will tell you, i have spent years
playing white label promos that became part of the mainstream some 18 months later. as a dj
you have to decide what to pander to: exposing the music or packing the dancefloor or a healthy
combo of both. 

The Rave/Techno scene is no different. There are alot of djs that are there because of the scene
and the status which goes with being the dj. Also there are a lot of punters who just want to hear their
techno anthems because they know them and have their moves down. Is there more tolerance / exposure
to other types of music? Are the djs experimenting? or is it just heavy metal or frat rock with
a better sense of dress and drugs but ultimately same reactionary views of music.

I can not say. I have given so much of my life to finding/exposing obscure bands. For most of 
the 80's that meant the independent labels around the world. Then the excitment, the true 
innovation shifted into the world of dance music. Many of my ilk did not acknowledge that, they did
not see the historical paralells between the house culture and the punk culture. They were comfortable
with their indie guitar music, they had the scene down, they stopped listening and learning.
and now that the techno scence both socially and musically is big, there is big business to be done
and all major record labels have their techno pointman and there are a lot of djs happy being djs
at big legal raves. 5 years ago when the first justified ancients of mumu (KLF to you kids) came out,
it was hard to imagine the manager of Echo and the Bunnymen (Bill Drummond) would come up with such 
undanceable dance music. What has happened since then best be be dismissed as an absurd nightmare. 

don't get me wrong. I sitll buy an absurd amound of music week after week after week. 
for a simple reason really: right now somwhere in some basement some pimple-faced young one is changing music forever. I just  wanna make sure to pause and listen to it, be it on a CD, vinyl or 8 track.

I generally agree.  After all, you are only planning on 500 people showing,
right?  At least as far as parking near the beach.  This seems like a pretty
optimal number for a small, friendly, intense rave.  I don't have a count of
SFRavers, but since half the people I normally go to raves with live in Santa
Cruz I'm sure I can bring 4 people . . . If every sfraver brings 3-4 people
it's gonna be fairly big.  Passing out flyers might be useful or not...

No, no, no.  First off, [he said, getting extremely anal about this whole
thing], if you want to talk about this we should settle on a definition of
cyberpunk. "Cyber"=information/technology, "Punk"=against the societal
norms...

Cyberpunk, as a literary movement where the word orignated, is based around
characters of the above definition, living in a postmodern world where the
aesthetic is the substance of that world.  Therefore, cyberpunk culture does
exist if a person is into using technology, has the punk attitude, and looks
at the world from a superficial (that doesn't mean bad, BTW) postmodern
aesthetic.  That exists today.  If your definition is coming from the media,
then, IMHO that won't be completely accurate.

What the "new idea" of cyberpunk culture is, IMHO, is, the complete
integration of technology in a postmodern world.  Never before has technology
been such an important part of culture - in cyberpunk it is extended to the
degree of technological implants in a person (like mirrorshades or memory
chips, etc.).  The punk idea has been around for some time, but when the two
are balanced out in a postmodern world you get cyberpunk.  

|Say, what exactly is an "organic, evolutionary matrix" anyway (I've
|noticed that CP types seem to have bled the word "matrix" of virtually
|all meaning).

Matrix, as coined by Gibson, is the consensual hallucination of cyberspace.  I
don't think the word should be used today, because cyberspace is not a
consensual hallucination.

|Which "CP concepts" have trickled down to the mainstream anyway?  Virtual
|reality?  I envision a nation of virtual shut-ins equiped with Leggy
|Supermodel sex software.   

Virtual reality is reaching the mainstream.  VR arcades exist in Chicago and
some other places where you can wear the whole suit and helmet and everything.
It's not reached the point of practical home-use for everybody but it's almost
there.

Some other "cp concepts" revolve around using whatever technology is available
to gain as much information as possible.  (remember, often times in cyberpunk,
information is the commodity in and of itself).  You're reading this message,
transmitted all over the world existing only in cyberspace for a comparitively
small virtual community.  IMHO that could be considered cp, although it lacks
anything punk, aside from the fact that the mainstream masses aren't reading
this.

|They make up for it by consuming more than their share of overpriced

Yeah, I agree (but I don't think the drugs are overpriced.  Since when is $3-4
for a hit of acid [has everyone forgotten about our little smiley friend in
the wake of X?] overpriced) that we do consume a lot.  Ravers to me seem to
consume a lot more than the hippie culture.  As an example, most people (at
least here in CO) *drive* to raves *every* week.  In the hippie culture, as
far as I know, people just hung arround haight-ashbury or their local
equivalent most of the time.  And when they did travel, it was usualy in a big
bus (ie Kesey and the pranksters), or in a big carpool, which I don't see
happenning at raves.  And we drive a lot more frequnetly, anyway.

|I hate to sound too cynical here, but realistically speaking, I don't
|see the rave thing as the begining of any sort of new way of
|life.  It may be a wonderful, sharing, loving experience for all and
|sundry, but ask yourself - am I going to be doing this in 5-10 years?

I think raves are an *example* of a developing way of life (cyberpunk for lack
of a more appropriate word).  The cyberpunk aesthetic ties in here in that:
technology is essential to raves (techno music, the lasers, the vr, the
fractals, vr, and other cyberdelic images), the punk aesthetic holds true
(remember, raves are usually an illegal gathering and don't forget nitrous, X,
acid, ketamine, or whatever other illegal, non-mainstream-socially-acceptable
substance turns you on), and the information aesthetic is there in a way
(SmartDrinks).

One thing about the postmodern/cyberpunk world is that it changes with
technology at an amazing rate, unparalleled in history in its advancements and
speed.  So, you will *not* be raving in 10 years, most likely, but obviously
some offshoot will exist.  Dance culture has been arround forever, and seems
to be an essential part of life, dating back to tribal times - sometimes it
wanes but its always there in some form or another.  

My idea of a rave 10 years from now is having a few friends over, all of you
putting on your VR suits, jacking into the matrix in some little-known
gridpoint in cyberspace, and joining a consensual hallucination of a party
with you and a 1000 of your closest virtual friends.  You could even program
your virtual environment to simulate trippin or X.  Just like the real thing
but without the temporary psychosis or brain cell loss.

|My admiration for true outlaws, technological and otherwise, who live
|a life they love outside of the mainstream and the law without
|hurting anyone else, knows no bounds.  But little of what I've seen in
|the various manifestations of CP culture demonstrates this. 

OK, I agree, but remember that cp culture is young (people usually don't even
know what the hell I'm talking about when I ramble on about the cyberpunk
aesthetic, how it is an interpretation of the postmodern world we live in and
other shit like that).  But, here's some examples:  ravers (as described above
- there is a certain amount of the punk ethic there, but more of a cyber,
cyberdelic actually, ethic present), hackers like Phiber Optik who just got
indicted - people say he's hacked into the White House which was previously
thought to be impossible (as far as I know, his hacking was for the sake of
information, not destroying - more cp), MARS (or was it KISS - I'm not in CA
or England so I can't remember) pirate radio station in England that was alive
in the house/techno era.

|For every genuine free-thinker and kind-mad hacker soul I've met, I've met 50
|losers who think ripping people off is somehow justified if it's done
|through technological means.  

"Cyberpunks" as hackers, as far as I'm concerned, denotes an individual taking
advantage of technology to gain information, not with the intent of ripiing
someone off.  Most cyberpunk hackers rip people off only by hogging some CPU
time, illegally.  And most "true" cyberpunk hackers would realise when they
are hogging up a lot of cpu time, and call back when noone's on the system,
IMHO. 

And the WarGames generation is still around, though dwindling.  I use the
WarGames generation to mean that generation of hackers who hacked for the sake
of rebellion and suburban boredom.  Those are the ones that really ripped
people off and justify it indirectly 

|The standard line I've liked lately to characterize the "cyberpunk
|culture" is this:
|
|"You think you're jacking in, but you're just jacking off"

There is a lot of bullshit in cyberpunk culture, but, at its heart such a
thing exists.  I think to realise this you must have some sort of appreciation
for the postmodern ideals from a philosophical viewpoint, and then relate it
to cyberpunk by way of technology/information and the punk ideals.

Your views might change if you read Stomring the Reality Studio, edited by
Larry McCaffery.  IMHO, he has put together an unbelievably coolshit
collection of essays on cyberpunk and postmodern culture and "sightbytes" from
various authors.  COntributors range from illiam Gibson, Bruce Sterling,
Timothy Leary all the way to Jean Baudrillard, William S Burroughs, etc.  Some
seriously cool shit.

Subject: did i ever tell you about this redneck rave dj

Despite the fact that this egotistic elistist response had very little to do
with the subject at hand, I can hardly resist a good flame war, so I'll
continue to stoke the fires.

> alas, here we go again. first of all, matching beats/queueing are not the only thing

So I was more justified when I was using shit equipment and sweating out the
mixing with a lot of luck?  God, what a pathetic assumption.  You make it
sound like Daddy just plunked down the cash for me to buy the latest equipment
and techno comps so I could stand in front of a crowd and wear a cap with "X"
on it.

> the basic argument in the cd vs. vinyl debate is the

This discussion has already been beaten to death by audio magazines and the
net as well.  It has been proven that if you throw a noise generator in front
of a CD, that these audiophiles all of a sudden feel a lot "warmer".  Mike
states that the noise from vinyl is lost on a club sound system.  It sure as
hell isn't lost on the sound systems I use.

> a Robo-DJ: "Yeah, i can do this, i can match that, i can smaple this" while the best

All the argument I get back for using vinyl sounds exactly like this.  Before
I had my equipment, all I heard was "you can't beat match", now that I can
beat match, it's "you can't choose the right music."   Well fuck you very much.

> djs in the world are the ones that care about the music and are creative in content

So where does vinyl vs. CD come in?  I don't see it anywhere.

Hasn't this been obvious since the start?

Makes me want to weep.  Unfortunately, you assume that all that I play is
techno.  Beethoven and Straus have made me cry more than any vocalized piece.
(They're not techno for you old-timer house DJ's)

> There are alot of djs that are there because of the scene

Yeah, I'm a DJ just to get exposure.  God knows the clubs are just dying to
hire me (sarcasm here).  Every rave I've been to in California, Nevada, and
Colorado have simply pummelled me with a techno beat.  I've never once heard
Meat Beat Manifesto, Wolfgang Press, PWEI, or even Wiseblood mixed in like I
try to do.  All I've heard is the L8EST GR8EST WITE LABEL trash mixed to
perfection.  You guys rant and rant about how white label is God's gift to the
world when the majority of it disappears down the drain.  Please tell me why I
heard Human Resource's damn "DOMINATOR" track six times in the same night from
LA's best DJ's last January when the track was already a few months old from
the white label.

> at big legal raves. 5 years ago when the first justified ancients of mumu (KLF to you kids) came out,

Thanks for the second huge assumption.  You just seem to feel that the
majority of this list is a bunch of pill popping teens out for a good time.
Please dispense your rare knowledge to us.

> don't get me wrong. I sitll buy an absurd amound of music week after week after week. 
> for a simple reason really: right now somwhere in some basement some pimple-faced young one is changing music forever. I just  wanna make sure to pause and listen to it, be it on a CD, vinyl or 8 track.

So we're back to the start.  Should people who live outside California who DJ
with CD's be dismissed as redneck dopey DJ's who just play James Brown is Dead
remixes whilst looking to get laid later in the night?

99%, yes.  Bands have even played there without the cops even coming over the
hill.  The only time they have come over in memory was to search for alcoholic
beverages.  

As far as parking is concerned,  there will be _no_ cars along the highway for
them to ticket.  I know that the cops may refrain from ticketing hundreds of
cars if we _all_ parked there, but I think it would just increase their 
curiosity.  When the Full Moon Rave was at Grey Whale Cove, the organizers in
my opinion were lucky that the cops decided not to tow....

Like I said, there's parking along Bonny Doon road (which is a public road
with no "no parking" signs and whose length is somewhat obscured from the
highway) and lotsa parking in SC.

Same as with vinyl (sort of).  The CD player has a pitch-control slider, and it
has buttons that cause the player to skip forward/backward in small increments
of time (less than 0.1 seconds).  The CD players also have some features that
turntables don't have.  You can cue the CD to a particular beat and have the 
player remember that location on the CD, and then pressing some "return button"
instantly re-cues to that beat.

The problem with these things is that they're awful expensive.  Technics and
Denon both make DJ CD players, and both list for over $1000.

Wrong, and I can prove it mathematically.  (Don't ya hate engineers?)

With a 45rpm record, one revolution of the record takes 1.33 seconds to rotate.
Dividing by 360, each degree of rotation takes 3.7 milliseconds.  A DJ can
*easily* move the record back-and-forth in a 10-degree arc, which amounts
to 37 milliseconds of sound.  If a typical beat lasts 5/75ths of a second,
that's 67 milliseconds.

8)I'll defend you on this one before someone inevitably attacks you.  At the small

8)more to produce than vinyl.  The whole deal about CDs being cheaper to produce

I'll attack you both on this.  The only reason CDs cost more to produce
in low quantities is because there are only two places in the world
where they make CDs and they are very busy pressing 24 hours a day.
Consequently they charge a lot to do limited edition pressings only
because they don't want to waste their time.  I.e they want to
discourage small pressings; but they can do it for cheaper than records
if they wanted to.

Pete,

did not mean to get you so wound up. but thanks for the flame, woke me up from a snooze.
I was not talking about white labels. I was talking about other type of music. 
other tempos, other instruments. other languages.

I don't care if you have expensive equipment or buy only CDs as long as you are open to playing 
new things and exposing your audience.

One other thing - never forget that for every unknown record that I took a blind chance on
and bought, there are 5 or 6 that were no good. I do not think my approach to finding new
music is either cost effective or wise. But I have gone about it for more than ten years
and have built an addiction.

once again, i was talking about music not so much technology. you can't buy taste and
tolerance.

Good luck to you.

I doubt it.  I bet if you told Prime Cuts to send you $200 of stuff on vinyl,

I have to defend my adopted home state.  I know that Spun and James
both use Meat Beat's "Helter Skelter" in their sets, and I've heard
the Wolfgang Press' "Time" on a tape by Jeno, so there are definitely
some SF DJs who play "stuff other than techno."  But the whole issue

really know what it is and don't get into it and/or don't have the
capability, and the watered-down snowball, there is a basic problem
which is almost inescapable: even those who are capable, willing, able,
and >do< become the right people, there eventually can be so many
of the right people that the right people do not all know each other,
(even some common experiences are not shared by all which are important
to some greater social consiousnesses,) and thus among the right people
the thing becomes less personal, more impersonal, because each right
person does not know all the other right people, or as much so, and
the once close-nit family turned large wonderful family turns into
gigantic multifacited monsterous sorta extended kinda neat maybe family,
and the thing gets diluted just because of that.  Thus, while there
are many factors which can prevent the `wrong' people from coming,
I propose that there is unfortunately an eventual end or difficulty
in integrating the number of right people you can have for an effective
rightness.

Do we REALLY want another something-X-name?  REALLY?  Not everybody takes

wrong, I don't wanna do a toontown either] then maybe we should think about
the name... seems to me most of the best raves don't highlight all that E

if mozart had an eletric guitar available to him
the stuff he did on it would be incredible
point being, no matter what the technology is
there can always be an artist to master it and do something artistic
with it

BUT vinyl rules, cd's suck
yes, you have pitch control and even a little scratchign ability
but it doesnt have that same visual/sensualness that vinyl does
it is very cold technology
vinyl is cheaper, and if something is out on cd, chances that other
people have it are highly likely,
there is no REAL new music coming out on cd
whereas some of the white labels that people dig up 
are the only copies getting played anywhere
if its on CD its got to be a little commercial

the one thing about there being lots of bad white labels and fewer

I've resisted the urge to post my reviews to the sfraves because of the
apparent lack of interest in anything non-calendar, but if anyone would like
the complete set of them, mail me.  Here's a review I did on a release called
"Logic Trance":

12  3   09:42 Psychick Warriors: Maened

Comments: Looking for something to replace that worn out "Give Peace A Dance
2" disc?  This is it!  Definitely the BEST collection of trance and ambience I
have ever purchased.  What is most intriguing about this two CD set is the
number of new names on it.  There simply isn't one dead track.  The whole comp
flows wonderfully with the first disc being more of a deep "chill" and the
second disc holding the more danceable yet highly melodic tracks.  The Orb
track is lifted directly from Aubrey Mixes, the Shamen track is a highly
remixed version of "Possible Worlds", and "Pure Pleasure" is an ambient
version of the original, but the rest of the artists' contributions are what
make these discs so incredible.  The CD packaging is in a double-slimline with
detailed information about each track.  I only wish they had put in addresses
for the labels credited, let alone Logic's own address.  Nice art though.

Summary: 10/10.  Remember how much you paid for your import of Orb's
"Adventures"?  Just remember that as you fork over the $35 for this double
disc.

	When I said "I hope we get ehough of the right people" for the
SFraves rave, I just meant at least a variety of friendly people who
are into the community spirit of this whole thing.  Also, really
freaky insane people were outnumbered 10:1 by beefcake jocks at JUICE.
(nothing against beefcake jocks, except I don't think they are very
interesting.)  So I hope we get some "characters" too.  It bothers me
when I see people at raves that seem judgemental.  Without a sense of
community and acceptance, this scene will come unstiched.  (Is this
what's happening now?)
	As for the name of our rave, how about like "PULSE" or
"HEARTBEAT", or "NeXTDIMENSION".  "dance@beach.rave.xtc"?  Nerdy, you

  I have heard at least 3 or 4 techno songs that sample "Helter
Skelter" or "Radio Babylon" by Meat Beat.  But I have heard the song
itself in a set.  The only other song that I know of that is probably
sampled more is the classic House song "A day in the life" by 
Black Riot.
  Speaking of "stuff other than techno", I have fun mixing everything
from old TV tunes and the Archies to Some classic Kraftwerk (which can
sound really good in a rave set).  And I've been know to toss in a
world beat track every so often.
  So what are some other non-techno songs you like to mix in or hear?

D) Sound really tacky (i.e. The X above - correct me if I'm wrong)

Only item C) has anything *good* about it ... i.e. The Top, the rest
is just my way of saying "if you don't know what it is, then don't go."
But, the one named Destination Venus, despite the glossy big flyer,
does have some good DJs, so we can only assume they're going to do at
a minimum a fair job at this rave.
(Question is, how much $, and exactly how good it is for all that $$?)
I sound awful talking about money, but if someone actually knows the
people putting it together and can give us some sort of explaination,
that would be most appreciated ... but that's >always< the case so

Wait a second folks, do I have to repeat myself?  There isn't any hard
evidence that vinyl produces a "cleaner" "warmer" sound.  The sonic range
doesn't compare to what a CD can produce.  Take a static generator and layer
it over a CD and you've got your "warmth" flowing out the speakers.

Besides, just WHAT kind of music are we talking about here?  90% - 100%
synthesized?  Are you telling me that analog reproduction is better than
digital for a digital source?

Subject: Connection & buses


Okay okay okay I can get a clue :)

Conn-X-Tion is no more.

Connection it is.

On the flyer I'm working on I already have "Turn on log in reach out" - I can
also add the "Huge evergrowing pulsating..." around the edges of the backside,
I guess...


I am now in total agreement about the "X" part.  What was a feeble attempt at
a punny name came down to a real bad allusion. Sorry.


About the buses... how should we work out selling the tickets for the ride down
from SF? (or maybe mountain view? Geoff, are you _sure_ they wouldn't ticket
in the Tower parking lot? I've had my car _towed_ from a rave once when I 
parked in a Wherehouse parking lot)

This is how I envision it...

Have tickets for the bus sold at Amoeba. A few of the people on the list
work there and could possibly help... I'll call Mark tonight.  

	This would mean we'd have to come up with some sort of not-easily-
reproducable "ticket".  

	We might be able to get around this by handing them a simple flyer of
some sort, and them writing down their name (or their name + # of guests paid
for). That could work...

	I'd really like to keep ticket sales in as far advance as possible,
so that I know for sure if we could have two buses, or even enough interest
for one. The bus company needs reservations ten days in advance, but I don't
have to pay for them until three days in advance; that would be Monday, so
I'd like to have all the tickets sold by Sunday.  Do you think 47 or 94 people
would be willing to buy them ahead of time? Depends on the publicity of course.
We could also reasonably assume that a certain number of people will show up
to the bus departure site hoping for a ride... so we could stop the ticket
sales at, say, 80, and leave the 14 extra seats available for last-minutes..
Of course, ask everyone to bring a photo-ID or something with them...

	I think this'll work.

	Also, how do people feel about charging the people who are down in SC
taking the bus, and those who do get there early enough to park on BD road?

I know the point of this is to make it a free rave, and I *still* want to do
that.  I just don't want to lose a huge amount of money, and I want to be able
to pay the DJ's a fair share.

One person suggested to me that asking for a donation up front would probably
be more effective than walking around the site asking for money., and also less
tacky.  I tend to agree; what if we made the SC shuttle and parking $5, but we
don't make it mandatory?  I know that most people would contribute, that I'm
not too worried about.  Does that sound good to everyone?

Given the choice, I'd probably choose a "nerd" name over a "drug-reference"
name, but I think the most important factor for the rave name is
memorability. Assuming that we want to throw it again, we'll need a name
that we can reuse and that sticks in people's brains and becomes familiar
(like 'toon town' or 'sharon').  Whether people remember it positively or
negatively is a different story! ;-)

While i will agree that i dont see how the sound from a synth 
on a CD would be worse than that of a Record
but the principle behind records sounding better than cd's
is that music on CD is not a continuous function
it is a bunch of points close together
kinda like the rectangle method of determining differentials
its gets really close to the right answer, but not quite there

but with music produced digitally it really doesnt matter

 its not a logical decision, just emotional
 i do realize that cd's dont warp, and dont really scratch as easy
 and even if they do, somtimes it doesnt matter
 and on the sound systems at raves, the better sound quality
 of vinyl doesnt show
 but i dont care, all the cd's in the world should be stuck

All-

        At Michael Wertheim's suggestion, I'd like to revise my
"dance@beach.rave.xtc" suggestion to "dance@beach.rave".  I like that
a lot better.
        My favorite idea is "NeXT DIMENSION", but I don't have as many
responses on that one.  We'll probably end up using ConnXtion
anyway...
        Speaking of flyers and such, I met a guy named Eugene who
works at Proper Publishing in Berkeley (on Shattuck).  He does those
impressive Toon Town flyers using Photoshop... he might be willing to
help us out with design.  (Obviously, he's good at it!)  I know he
moonlights making those flashy fliers for Toon Town, but maybe he will
do some voulteer work for a non-profit organization like ourselves.
Brian, mail me if you are interested in looking into this.

where would techno be without Kraftwerk?
a defining moment in my musical education was to see the german dummies at 
santa monica civic in 1981 on the computer werld tour. nothing short of
genius.

there is a remix of the New Fast Automatic Daffodils tune BIG which is called
BAKKA with a recurring electro pulse that would make the hand of Ted Koppel's

Mast e Mast with one of the fatest basslines I have ever heard. 

what else, let me think, there is this eyetalian bootleg of Sexual Healing 
with Marvin voice over a lazy beat that works well as a sunriser. the Jazz Documents 
have this single called code with a mutation called secret code which 
i have seen induce uncontrollable behavior on the dance floor and also old singles
by the moody boys and Bobby Konders which sound so good in the heat of summer,
shirtless and with a head full of rum. 

and like you said, being palyful with things folks will recognize (soundtracks)
and yet a change in the tempo and the vibe between sets.

Everyone knows that CDs and Vinyl both produce good sound. And that in
most rave circumstances, a close-n-play would exceed the reproductive
range of the speaker stacks. Especially when said stacks are subject
to amp clipping, drink spillage, and spontaneous combustion. (And don't yo

Subject: east-west comparison (water)

Just from a different set of experiences, I've insisted on finding
a water source at every rave I go to, and I've only failed at the ones
where everybody was supposed to bring their own (full moons, golden gate
park, etc.)  I've never paid for water.  (And I wouldn't pay for it,
so perhaps that has something to do with it -- but it's usually no big
deal finding water.)  Sometimes when there's a fountain available they'll
charge for the priveledge of having a glass, but I'd rather see it as an
added option than a silly charge in that case.

One of the things I love about raves is how people are really communal
about water.  Many people I've barely gotten to recognize or don't even
know freely offer their water to me so I can drink some!  I love that.
And, quite frankly, I'd rather have a friendly crowd and take the risk of
getting a disease or two than be an uptight worrywort.

While I'm on the topic of charging for water and diseases, there's someplace
which has the worst of both:  the former Soviet Union.  There are many, many
`water vending machines' which have a glass (a normal glass) that people
leave in place (except to stand there and drink the water).  They pay for
the water (quite a bit -- with the exchange rate as it was, I still found
I had to be frugal about how much I would spend and water wasn't within
>my< budget sometimes!!  Of course, I was living on $1 US per day ...)
After paying for it, the vending machine spits out water into the glass.
The person drinks the water.  There is no cleansing method for cleaning
the cup.  There are many lines around town for these things.
Raves are much, much better in my opinion.

As to smart drinks, every one I've ever bought (about eight or nine of them)
have been $3.  Of course, there's the free ones I've got ...

Well, at last Saturday's party, I was mixing both CD's and LP's (shock
horror!), and in addition to the usual dance fare (James Brown, Prince,
Cool World (yo!), the new Brian Eno track (yo**2!), etc), I added
in some Village People (surprise, it's already almost techno, and people
really like to dance with it), some Xavier Cugat (why not? He's sampled on
most of the good rave hits anyway), Yma Sumac (her Mambos are ripe for a
techno overhaul, and you wanna talk wailing divas, well, she's the ORIGINAL),
Multiplication Rock (De La Soul did it, I can too), and just a tiny
smattering of East Bay Grease.

I mean, I'm sure all you REAL DJ's would just blow your nose all over this,
since I'm just using a home stereo system (the most rave part of which is a
EQ box to bomb the bass), but hey, it got the party going.

Don't tell me about your rules. I'll just go break them and make you upset.

Subject: Thursday Night Warmup

I took the day off during my working/vacation visit to SF this week
and did my once-every-three-years shopping tour of The Haight, stopping
at the expected places, buying hats and picking up announcements.

One that looked pretty good for tonight was a little green card 
announcing Goa Gil, Magic D and Carlos along with a live performance
by Darwin Chambre with "Meandering Marcus on Violin."  Also
"Hardcore Stimulation for the Eyes, Ears, Body, Mind and Soul . . .
Interactive Video - Paradise, 17 Screen Video Wall - XKP Collective,
etc.etc.

The phone number gave a map point at 2390 Lombard across the street
from Baker's Square.  For $5 we got a ticket stub and a lollipop in
the shape of the letter A.  The site turned out to be 550 Natoma,
a small room, maybe a dance or rehearsal studio, about 30 x 50 feet
with a projection room used by the DJs.  A raised platform for the
dance floor.  No real light show as it turned out, but Carlosand
Goa Gil gave it a go.  Carlos was on when I came in, followed by
a short set from Darwin Chambre, really two or three guys with
synths who were doing well enough but didn't have the house volume
needed to get the crowd going.  Goa Gil followed with at least an
hour and a half of pretty relentless techno, nothing fancy, followed
by Carlos once more.  

It was fairly crowded most of the time.  I would rate the DJs as better
than the crowd, at least half of which basically sat or stood around,
but the dancing was pretty good with a committed core keeping things
rolling.  Not a full-scale rave, more like a DJ party.  But things
were basically pretty cool overall.

I did have one big complaint -- cigarettes.  I just don't understand
how anyone can puff and dance at the same time (much less subject the
rest of us to it).  The name of the game here is fresh air, or as
the runners call it, VOmax, and it got pretty smoky for a while. 
When I can smell it on my clothes after leaving a place, it's a sign
of too much too close.

Lots of Feel-X cards on hand, not much else, although someone was handing
out a big stack of Equinox announcements.

All in all, a good Thursday night warmup for me.  They were still steady
at 4 am when I left . . .

One of the nice things about outdoor raves, IMHO, is that you can almost

have a friend who brings an enormous cooler with food and water and frozen

right ON!  I'm always happy to hear anything else mixed in with the usual

[who otherwise played a less-than-stellar set, IMHO] included both Santana
and P-Funk both of which got everyone going [lots of people singing along to
One Nation Under a Groove, and it was the real thing too, not the cover]
I'm probably completely insane, but I'd been dying to hear Santana at a rave
so I was thrilled. There's also a Santana song called Brotherhood which has
sort of a long 'rap' [60s, ya know] at the beginning that would be good.
And certainly any P-funk!  Also old techno like Kraftwerk, even W. Carlos!!

Warp, my personal favorite of all labels, has released this awesome comp on vinyl and CD  
and the track listing is as follows:

(0,1) Polygon Window by The Dice Man (5,10,,)
(0,2) Telefone 5 2 9 by Musicology (4,09,,)

(0,6) Preminition by Musicology (4,03,,)
(0,7) Spiritual High by UP! (7,41,,)
(0,8) The Egg by Autechre (7,32,,)
(0,9) Fill 3 by Speedy J (3,53,,)
(1,0) Loving You Live by Dr Alex Paterson (4,00,,)

(Commas and parens make sense if you have this comp already)

Overall its a great mix of styles, bpm's and sounds--I did note the open call for tapes and  
demos on the inside of the sleeve for future A.I. releases.  From the diagrams on the  
sleeve, it seems that most of these artists come from England and a few from elsewhere in  
Europe--wouldn't it be different to have a US group on the next one?

about how much dynamic range (i.e. sonic range) there is to reproduce on the best  
pressed dance record in the first place:  30 to 40 dB!  That's it!  Why the hell do we need  
CD's of this stuff if the vinyl will handle the dynamic range?  (No offense, Mike)

Mike Wertheim had another good point also: what about cost to produce vs. quantities  
under 1000?

Subject: The End

Ok, so we've summed it up as follows:

1. Sound quality between CD's and vinyl isn't important for dance music.
2. Vinyl dominates the dance market, thus more obscure releases come out only
   on vinyl.
3. Sometimes vinyl skips, bumps, or scratches.  This is true for CDs as well,
   but will probably never happen unless there is an earthquake or you have
   broken equipment or bad discs.
4. The average beat doesn't last 5/75th's of a second, but the average vinyl
   DJ can't cue to .01333 of a second either.
5. The music is more important than the technique, but if you've got the
   music, then the technique can enhance it.  In other words, it isn't the
   medium, it's the message.
6. Vinyl purists have usually never tried DJing CD's before.  CD purists have
   usually never tried DJing vinyl before.
7. CDs suck, vinyl rules.

Keep in mind that the DJs here (Salt Lake) in clubs follow the following rules:

1. Talk as much as possible.  Sell beer, your radio station, or just make a
   general ass out of yourself between songs.
2. DJ CDs by a vast majority.  Mainly because this is what the mainstream
   sends them for free.
3. Never mix, never beatmatch, and rarely do a decent segue.
4. Play the 7" domestic version at all costs.  Remixes are evil, perverted,
   and weird.
5. Suck.

Why I like CDs:

1. Small, compact, easy to transport.
2. Digital manipulation has much more possibility than analog.
3. Go well in my car, my portable at work, and my six-disc at home.  Yes, I
   listen to this stuff a lot.  When I only DJ a rave once a month, instead of
   six nights a week, it is hard to get a feel for the music without listening
   to it all the time.
4. I like my Denon deck a lot more than the work I've done on Technics 1200's.

Check on 1-4.  For the enthusiast the CD is great because you can
get all these compilations and pay a lot less money for a lot more
music.  On the down side these compilations are a lot of times
fucked up and the makers chop songs, put on bogus mixes, etc.  Of course
you can get CD singles but then the price factor is negated.  Plus,
they aren't releasing CD singles of old songs whereas you can go
to a dance music store and pick up LOTS of older records only in
12" format.  On the other hand again you can get old songs in album
format on CD more easily than in LP format.  On the down side for
vinyl, LP format dance compilations are just as fucked up as the
CD comps, plus the volume that they are pressed at is usually 
too low and if you are trying to cue them the grooves are so tight
the needle skips out a lot.  XL Recordings and the remix companies
do better about fixing this though.  I would say that not just the
"obscure" stuff only comes out on vinyl, I would say that 30%
of the stuff that come out on vinyl will come out on CD.

When you're talking about DJ'ing (real DJing, not bogus club DJing), the
technique is important.  I've tried out the DJ players (Technics, Denon,
Numark) and the feel is way different.  I'm sure with more practice
I could get a good technique going, but I'm still not going to
be able to do the vinyl-only tricks like spinbacks, etc.  Plus
it's nice to be able to see breaks coming up as you often can on
vinyl.

> 7. CDs suck, vinyl rules.

No doubt!  :-)  Actually, I'm slowly saving right now for a Denon.
I'd like to see if they lower their prices again and I'd like to 
see a looping feature so you could use it as a sampler even easier.
The insta-start feature is the best thing about the DJ CD decks.
The DJ (amatuer or serious) that's really into techno/rave/house is not
going to give up vinyl very easily since Europe itself isn't going
to give it up very easily.  Plus, since the scene is so much comprised
of a bunch of little labels they can't afford to go both vinyl and
CD so they go with what sells to their customers: 12".

I don't consider people like this DJ's anyway.  If you're not beat mixing,
there is no point in calling yourself a DJ.

Another huge plus for CDs.

> 2. Digital manipulation has much more possibility than analog.

Possibility isn't reality but the sampler effects are nice.  You can do
a lot already with samplers, sampling mixers, digital delay effects
and such, but CD players provide the possiblity that the makers
will pack this functionality in a cheap box.

I make tapes for this purpose.  Tapes are great because they are portable,
making them is good practice for DJing and listening to them is good
for critiquing your skills and remembering breaks and such for
later mixing.

Nyah!  This all goes back to whatchulike.  If you have the money, buy both
and then post about it!  When I get my Denon I'll be sure and do that.

I talked to people who work at tower they say that they have left their cars

why not just make a laminant (sp) which the person buys which is good for
admission into the rave as well as a round trip bus ride.  I know a great
raver artist who would do the design for free, we could get them done via
color xerox and laminated.  A collector's item/ticket/souvinier/admission

all rolled into one. It will encourage people to pay up front as well!

If you ask for $5 donation for the shuttle I think that'll work.

Well, I struck out tonight.  Got to the map point for cLOUDd bASe FUCK
(701 3rd) a little late, close to 2 am, found nobody except other people
looking for maps.  177 Townsend was just down the street and the scene
was pretty awful, what can you say for something that's on the air
on 106.1 except it attracts clueless dweebs from six counties, so I caught
a cab from there to check out something called Cosmofunkagroovathon
a half a block off Market near Van Ness, but as you can probably tell
from the name and location it didn't look very ravey either, so I bowed
to reality and headed back to my visiting quarters for the week.
Would have loved to check out Equinox, but out by the airport was way
too far in a cab, and besides it probably wasn't the best night for
an outdoor rave, very gusty and chilly downtown at least.

So tomorrow it looks like Waldo Or Bust, right?!

	and 814-CARE and 814-ACID but they were all taken. :)
	The background music is the UltraViolet Catastrophe A-side... 
	60 seconds of it at least....


Names:  I just want to make sure we're all on base with the name.  Therefore,
	I have YAS (yet another survey).  Please return to me the _one_ name
	you think works the best.  I do think "Connection" is the best - I
	initially liked "Conn-X-Tion" only because I come from an area where
	raves are _supposed_ to have druggy allusions (Love Sex Dance, 
	Double Hit Mickey, etc.) but maybe it wouldn't be right for us...
	I also think that something that could only be understood by UNIX

Vote for _one_:
	Connection
	Conn-X-Tion
	DeepByte
	chmod u+x
	Contact
	Nexus
	Outernet
	Eternity

Again, in my mind Connection is simple enough that everyone understands its
meaning, and yet it relates directly to the list.  

Also, most flyers have "promoter" names -  if we think we might want to have 
more of these in the future, then coming up with a good promoter name might
be in our interest.  I'd like to say, "presented by the community of SFRaves",
but that might throw people.  Maybe not.  I did like "Baud Squad".... let me
know.

(send replies to this survey via private e-mail)


Also, about the buses:  I called Mr. Floppy, and he's going to get back to me
later tonight with the number for Eddie, the guy who runs the Floppy bus. He
said it was a great bus, about 40 person capacity, with a bathroom, and
very clean.  He said Eddie has other buses too...  I will call Eddie tonight 
or tomorrow and see what he says.  

Other than that, I'm planning on going over to Ameba tonight and talking to
Mark about selling tix there.  I wonder how much of a take they'll want...


Also, Paul (Mr. Floppy) gave me B.R.A.D.'s phone #, as well as Goa Gil's. Do
we want them?  We already have: Carlos (confirmed), Spun (80% confirmed),
Edan Cassidy (I have to call him and ask what he wants to be referred to
as) confirmed, Jon Drukman (what do you want to be called Jon?), and from
Sacramento DJ Drew and Boy Wonder. That's already 5 - we can go for 10 hours
with that number, so we don't really _need_ anymore, but I think one more
SF DJ might help...

This thing's coming together NICELY!!!

p.s. - call the number!!!
