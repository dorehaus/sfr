Subject: [sfraves] Weekend Review... 7 Deadly Sins Was Sooooooo Dope! Hello 2Day!!

Yeah... I know it lke mondo 2 soon 2 post my weekend update already being thatit was only Friday night, but I know 4 a fact that I"m not goin' out anymore this weekend so I can do my homework for school... oh yeah... I re-entered University Of Phoenix 'cause they started a new well... la la la... I"m back in again...

Anywaze, OK.. I know it's like hella early that I got home from the party, but a non Groover, only likes Melodic Trance, total wall flower unless he's on drugs @ a party friend luckily went with me to the party!  So yeah... I kinda like mondo lucked out last minute in actually getting a ride there 'cause seriously... this party was very Momumental (is that the right word I looking 4?) & somewhat historic for our scene in so many ways & I soooo could not miss it!

BUt yeah.. got there early to pay the b4 10:00 PM fee... it was Groovy... no one was really spinning yet although Arson was totally scratchin it up in the Jungle room!!

OK... I won't mention all the DJs I saw spin earlier, but the ones who totally got me Groovin'!  During the 1st part of the party, in the Breakbeats room there was this Dude do a tag set... I guess this DJ's name is Kris Kent & man... he was playing some Awesome tracks!!  I mean... it was Dope 'cause every record he played was one of my favorite songs!   He spun alot of Future Break tracks but man... it was so yummy that I was so hard to stay still!

Ooooooh My Goodness.. Hello 2Day... 1 of my favorite Jungle DJs from Sac spun @ the party... E.M.P.!!!  Hell fuckin' yeah man!!  I mean... this DJ was the DJ @ the snow shindig earlier this year in the mountains who spun the most amazing Jungle set I ever heard this year!!  Since then, we hung out once in Berk by chance!  Anywaze... his set was Damn Sick!!  I Loved it!!  I mean... it was kinda like divided in 2 parts kinda... from what I could tell.  He spun the 1st 1/2 like w/ alota Raga Jungle & OK... I'm still tryin' 2 learn what Tek Step actually sounds like... but I think he played alota that to during this part!  Then the 2nd 1/2 had alota just hard hitting, mean sounding Jungle that oooh man... I Love it!  Oh Yeah.. his costume was like this I dunno... an S&M Pirate??

Oracle's set was Amazing! He started out spinning Jungle! I'm sure I heard a few classic tracks, totally smooth hard beats, then he went into some harder Jungle tunes... then his set went into Techno... well wait... I mighta heard a breakcore tune somewhere in between that though... then from Techno he went into this totally hard hitting Funky House... played some Psy Trance in there then back to House!! WoW.. I Loved this set!!  I mean... all the music Oracle weaved together was totally smooth and jus' well ya know... it one of those Journey sets where like he started here, but like went on this Awesome Adventure & totally ended up there!!  Dope!

What sucked was EMP & Oracle started spinning @ the same time & I jus' totally had to keep switching rooms!!  BUt it was totally worth it!!  

Dymphna spun a Dope set.  It was Hard Ass Jungle all the way through & welll... her set was pretty early in the night, but it set the tone for the room!  It was Dope 'cause she closed w/ the Jungle Remake of Sean Paul's 1st single... "Shake That Thing" is the name of it, right?

Oh yeah...  ..COM & Mainframe from LA totally spun this wicked Hard Ass Raga Jungle set for what I was there for... I mean.... the crowd was pretty built up in there @ that point & hella people were dancing!  MC Red October was pretty CooL 2!  I mean... he totally switched up his styles of MCing & it was all smooth!

So yeah... those were the DJs who totally filled me up man!!  I Loved it!

The crowd was pretty eclectic & diverse, but it was totally good energy & Mondo Groovy vibes from everyone while I was there man!  It wasn't like this Huge Mini Massive dealie or totally empty, but it was just the right size!  I met alot of Awesome people earlier, got to know some people better who I've hung out w/ a few times, an ofcourse, there was Mondo Family there tonight that Totally fills my Heart when we get 2gether like this!

OK... but here's what Totally trip me out & made me actually Happier about the party!  There were 2 people there who I haven't seen in years!  The 1st person I bumped in2 was this Dude Tremel... We went to college together like back in the day.  @ 1st, I thought he was someone I thought was from my high school years, but this picture I took of us in video class 1 time like suddenly came to mind like seeing his face totally popped that photo in my head!  So yeah... the next time we bumped in2 each other, I totally appologized for bein' a dumb fuck & not remembering him right away & we actually caught up on a few things about each other as of lately!

Then while I was kickin' it in the smoking area... this girl walks up to me!  She said she knew who I was & said that I would know who she was when she told me her name was Katherine!!  Good Shit, Katherine was 1 of my co-workers when I worked @ Reel.com cooporate & we became hella good friends!  We stayed in touch 4 a while after I stopped working there then eventually lost touch but got back in touch through, Hello 2Day, FRIENDSTER!  LoL  BUt yeah.. this was the 1st time in 3 years we saw each other & man... So Dope!

OK... Decorations... WOW... Each Room totally fit the Deadly Sin it was named after!  Tomb stones, cob webs, Awesome visuals, Bad Ass lighting in the main room, and everything was well... it was like a mixture of Cartoons & Asain design & well, Halloween!

OK... sorry this was like way 2 long... but man... this party was Awesome!!  I mean... with the Groovy things that happened tonight & Music that was So Dope, it makes me like mondo proud of what we got!

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] Oh yeah... the costumes

So yeah, like nearly everyone @ 7 Deadly Sins were guzzied up in something!  I noticed there were like alota "couple themed" costumes!  Just 2 name a few: a guy decked out in formalish J Crew clothes wearing a crown & a girl wearin' like a brides maid/prom dress & I thought they were the king & queen of the prom, this dude in Zombie make-up wearing a tuxedo & this girl in a pretty dress with Awesome Blue streaks in her hair looked like they were ghosts from Titanic, A Dude dresses as a priest & another dude in a demon get up, apart they looked like normal trick or treator, but together they made sense as Good & Evil...

Miki costume was Dope... she was a wind up doll with an actual wind thingie on her back, Oracle was well... I dressed in 70's garb & I was tryin' 2 figure out if he looked like a Brady Brother or a Partridge Boy... Tina aka MoonChyld was a fem bot... oh yeah... there was alota fake fur goin' on @ the party also!  Dymphna was Tank Girl!

The costume I was thinking of doing was a picture frame, but construction on that from when I decided to do that would of been limited!  Then I decided on being a dice, but materials for that was like well... I didn't have enough materials for that.  So I jus' took my vampire teeth, wore black clothes, my Customatix shoes, & this olive-y green polyester dress jacket & I was the Polyester Cat Walk Fasion Model Vampire!

Then there were alota sexy nightie gown girls, oh, there was this clown mime, & I think 1 of my favorites of the night was this Dude who was freom San Diego & he was a Pepridge Farm Goldfish!  Oh yeah, Dodja was a "cereal killer"; he wore cereal boxes on his shirt w/ knives sticking out of them & blood stains all around!  Oh Yeah... then there was Veronica who was that evil lady in 101 Dalmations!!

Everyone at the party was pretty much animated!  It was Fun!!  OK.. I'm done =)  LoL

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] Thusday Night: Thirsty Bear and Bad Kitty

I started school again last Thursday.  I mean, I had to like re-enter University of Phoenix 'cause of the appendix drama that happened 2 months ago & I had to drop.  So now I"m back there again basically starting over & redoing the class I like did 1/2 way before, but now my class nights are on Thursday instead of MOnday.

But it's Groovy 'cause ofcourse it means that I could go out dancing a lil' b4 I head back to the East Bay, ya know!  So after class, I went directly to Thirsty Bear!  That was fun!!  There were a few family folks hangin out there, there was yummy House music playing, & it was fun!  BUt the only place you could dance was upstairs and there was a private party going on so I could dance there!  Oh yeah... I don't remember who the DJ was, but man, he played some nice laid back funky house tunes!  But I did feel like hella bad I missed Cubik Y Origami do their live set =(

So After socializing for a while, I went strait to Bad Kitty @ Anu!  Wow... LoL... that place is pretty nice!  As soon as I got in there, Seraphim was spinning some old skool Beastie Boys!!  Dope!  Then she started up the Electro Clash... YUMMY!  It's fun dancing to Electro Clash 'cause it's almost like well... I was doin' alota mod stuff from like the 80s... lol

Then Samira went on & busted out the Hard, New Skool Breakbeats in her set!  She totally kept it up for most of her set!  Then she went in2, what I know her best for, the Dreamy Breakbeats with like alota soft, sustained instruments & this funky 2-4 beat!  This was a fun set!

J-Rock went on next & kept it on with the hard, new skool breakbeats!  I could sworn that he slipped in sme old skool tracks in there as well!!  But what really got me was the last track he played!!! 2 Step!!  I Loved it!

There wasn't too many people there on Thursday.  Oh My Goodness man, it was Groovy though 'cause there was this one kid there that said soemthing to the effect that sine this was Seraphim's night @ Anu, he had to support 'cause he's a huge fan of hers!!  Sweet!  The bartendaer there, Mohall {sp}, is pretty so nice! 

I mean... this was like my 1st time ever going to this event, but man, I totally missed Seraphim so much!  So yeah... this may be my after class hang out before I head home!!!  

Seriously... this is a fun lil' Thursday night hotspot to check out!!!  The music's always gonna be good 'cause you got 2 Groovy residents; Seraphim & Feliz Da Dog (woof woof).

Oh yeah... thanks 2 everyone who gave me birthday gifts that night!!!  Hello 2Day, Nico & Pedro, you 2 fuckin' Rock...Thanks! =)

Good Stuff!

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

"They can get all the synthesizers they want, but nothing will ever take 
the place of the human heart."

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Come join the .newstylesound. .recordings. announce list!  (dj2, Origami, Cubik, Loopsurgeon)

I'm starting a little low-traffic announce/discussion list so that
people can have an easy way to know when one of the .newstylesound.
artists are playing out, when we've got a new release about to drop,
etc.  I'd estimate 1-5 posts per month, unless a bunch of people sign
up and some kind of interesting discussion pops up :)

Get hooked up at:
http://lists.djorigami.com/listinfo.cgi/newstylesound-announce-djorigami.com

If you'd like to know what Origami, Cubik, Loopsurgeon, dj2, or any
other NSS folks are up to, please subscribe!  I promise not to spam
you.

Also, if anyone would like a newstylesound sticker or two, hit me up
and I'll drop 'em in the mail.  They are blue on white, with the same
NSS logo you can see at djorigami.com.

Cheers,
George C.

Subject: [sfraves] 7 deadly sins revu


7 deadly sins was lots of fun.

The space was well decorated and varied in mood atmosphere. 

Big ups to the pangea / eden collective.  Thank you for a wonderful event.

The Highlights of the event were Rexual Healing and Oracle (soon to be known as Adam Weaver).  The track selection was off the hizzle and mixing was top notch.

Thanks for bringing dj Assault.  A very nice man indeed.  A true entertainer getting on the mic often to get and keep the crowd peak'd.  More west coast dj's should do this.  I know there are a lot of talented mc's out there doing it, but having the dj get on the mic actually works well.  dj's take note.

I saw alotsa friends there and was having a great time with them.

the schedule was thrown off a bit and I couldn't stay to see Praxis.  he is one of my favorite live acts.

guess i will just have to be satisfied with his records for now.

love always wins over the darkest hearts.
JOnas

Subject: [sfraves] RR: SPECTRE Review!

Holy fucking shit is all I can say. Otherworld and Tenderloft pulled off a 
SEVERELY kickin' party Friday night.

I arrived to the warehouse a smidge on the early side, and it was a beehive 
of activity. People running to and fro doing last minute prep work. They 
were just barely finishing up when people started to arrive, but things just 
kind of fell into place, and the next thing you knew, the party was in full 
swing.

This party had a really old skooly kinda vibe to it. Everyone was very 
friendly, the music was pumping, but it didn't have the overproduced massive 
feel to it at all. It was still very homey and raw. This was the 1st party 
in a LONG TIME that I just kind of met people all night randomly. (you 
people all know who you are, please for the love of god do NOT make me do a 
"shout out"...lol).

The music is what really cinched it for me tho...some of the best tunes I 
have heard in a long time as well.

Mutex started off with some hard techno and kinda got people in the mood to 
party. The next person I caught was Nemo, who played some really nice D&B. I 
believe after him was DJ M who also played some decent D&B. I was still kind 
of getting adjusted to everything at this point, so I didn't have time to 
properly observe any of the dj's. The 1st act i caught that I could pay 
attention to was Azeem. After Shortbus had played me some of Azeem's stuff 
the week before, I was itching to see what he was like live, and damn if 
that guy didn't deliver the goods! It's nice to hear hip-hop on a soundsytem 
that is big enough to pump, but not so huge that the sound just kinda of 
turns into a mess. Azeem and DJ Zeph kept it live and funky their whole set. 
I managed to slip into the main room during Azeems set to check out John 
Tejada, who was dropping some of the funkiest techno & tech-house I have 
ever heard. That motherfucker was mixin' smooth as buttah, and not even 
breakin' a sweat. He had the dancefloor positively jumping. I made it 
upstairs to the chill room to catch a house DJ who was pretty damn good, but 
unfortunately was being plagued by technical difficulties. Never got the 
guys name, but he was pretty fucking good despite the problems. I had never 
seen Jon Williams, so I worked my way back downstairs to catch some of him, 
and godamm the guy was just bangin' it. Gritty, dirty, sexy, bangin' techno. 
My new mission in the next few weeks is to pick up some of the stuff he was 
dropping, cuz it was fucking ILL. Made my hair stand on end!!!! I also 
caught a few minutes of the infamous RedStickMan as he dropped booty house 
and worked his way into NEW ORDER (yay, my favorite!). I was kind of running 
on empty tho, and had to find a place to gather my few remaining braincells, 
so off I went in search of a quiet spot...

The night for me is kind of a blur. I was running around trying to absorb as 
much as I could, meet as many people as I could, and have fun...all of which 
I managed to do. Definately one of the better parties I have been to in a 
LONG time. One of the best parts for me was seeing the smiles on all the 
Otherworld crew' faces as they went about their various duties through the 
night. These were the smiles of people who were happy with the results of 
their efforts, and since I was witness to their efforts, I know they busted 
their asses, and deserved to have those smiles at the end of the night.

Anyhoo....big BIG ups to Otherworld and Tenderloft for properly introducing 
me to Bay Area partying. I had a fucking BLAST, and will definately be 
around for anything else you throw at us.....

Respect.

i've been reading little stories related to this for nearly a year...
perhaps now the mass of ravers will finally get politicized.
I'll never get drafted, so i'm not personally worried, but I
certainly don't want anyone else shipped over to Vietnam-redux

Subject: [sfraves] RR: SPECTRE Review!(part 2)

How could I have forgot two of the BEST parts of the evening???? See what 
happens when my little brain gets taxed too hard? lol

Ok... I caught two other acts that blew my mind Friday night. 1st off, and 
most importantly Andres Octavio...the guy played the illest dub set I have 
ever heard. I've heard tons of dub house sets, but this was just str8 up 
dub, and it was SLEAZY. So fucking deep, dark, nasty and kinky it wasn't 
even funny. Fucking blew my mind. And the guy is HELLA nice to boot. Also, 
Freaky Chakra did a live set that was pretty godamm on point. He played a 
little less electro than I wanted to hear, but he was workin' it 
nonetheless. Even tho he was just rocking a laptop, a sequencer and a couple 
other little pieces of gear, he looked like he was busy creating a monster. 
Met him at the end of the night, and he was extremely genuine and nice.

Once again, let me reiterate how fucking sick this party 
was....FAN-FUCKINGTASTIC!!!!

M-

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RR: SPECTRE Review!(part 2)

Well, for as long as I have been a dancer (years!) I still have trouble identifying the various types of EDM, let alone the numerous DJs in the scene.

So, I just let the music move me.

I gave up on wondering (or figuring out) who's playing what.

But your review was right on the money. Thanks for providing these details.

I just know that I couldn't stop dancing, all night long, and I kept running back and forth between the rooms. Plus the D&B was some of the best I have heard lately. 

Also, the decorations had the Halloween spirit (for example, a graveyard in the smoking room), and the vibe was incredible. I kept seeing people that I know from all over the rave scene. 

Seems to me that this crew really had their act together and they pulled it off quite nicely. I had a big smile on my face all night long. I was the happy dancer.

Lost Tribe Presents . . . <br><br>
is still reeling from the abrupt cancellation of our Halloween
event.<br>
All of the tickets had been distributed, Bruce from JK had spent many
hours<br>
fine-tuning the sound systems, Mike Clay had spent hours setting up and
preparing the visuals,<br>
The DJs had spent many hours preparing special sets to blow you
away,<br>
Jack Cleveland had pretty an artshow of his original works designed to
titillate,<br>
and we had spent many hours carving pumpkins, planning treats,
surprises,<br>
a really fun 'only on Halloween' ceremony, and decorating the place -
even <br>
the bathrooms had been made 'special'.<br><br>
<b>The sad truth is - there was no GOOD reason for the 
cancellation.<br>
</b>Unbeknown to us, in early October, RawHide was visited by 
agents<br>
of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC).&nbsp; During the course of
ABC's<br>
inspection they observed patrons drinking alcoholic beverages
outside<br>
on the rooftop garden deck - according to ABC, this was a violation of
the &quot;rules&quot;<br>
(even though it had been going on for years and years) - they cited the
owner<br>
and his license to sell alcoholic beverages was suspended for 3
weeks.<br>
The owner never contacted us to explain this - he went on
vacation.<br><br>
When we reached the owner on Monday the 27th, he explained to us what had
happened<br>
and he was anxious because he hadn't been given his license back - that
happened on Tues.<br>
On Wednesday, he told us that he wasn't going to allow our event to go
until 4 because<br>
we didn't have an 'after-hours' permit (even though, legally, it was his
job to obtain it).<br>
Thanks to some much appreciated quick action from both John Wood and
Terrance Alan<br>
of the San Francisco Late Nite Coalition and the city's new Entertainment
Commission -<br>
we were assured on Wednesday evening that we could have the necessary
permits in time.<br><br>
On Thursday, we were 9/10 of the way through filling out the permit
application with<br>
RawHide's owner when he changed his mind and told us he just wasn't,
under any circumstances,<br>
going to allow us to go until 4 am.&nbsp; This was a bummer - but we
attempted to let as many of you<br>
as possible know so that you could adjust your evening plans accordingly
- many thanks to<br>
the DJs for agreeing to the changes.<br><br>
On Friday afternoon, as we were completing the decorating, RawHide's
owner was very nervous -<br>
the place had yet to be properly cleaned (his cleaning crew hadn't shown
up) and he kept<br>
changing agreements that we had all agreed to in August when we booked
the place and <br>
confirmed both in September and earlier in the week.&nbsp; Still, we were
trying to work through issues,<br>
including helping him clean the place, when he announced that it was just
too much stress for him<br>
and that he was cancelling the event - shock hardly describes our
reaction - true, we only<br>
had a verbal agreement with the guy, but over 500 people were planning on
Sweet! in less than<br>
5 hours and we had done a very successful event with the same owner in
August.<br>
I don't know what are legal rights are with a verbal contract, but if
anyone does, we would<br>
sure appreciate hearing from them.<br><br>
No amount of persuasion, or even an intervention from the person who had
introduced us to the owner,<br>
was successful in getting him to change his mind.&nbsp; Was he nervous
about a potential return visit<br>
from ABC ? - definitely - but in talking to him we also learned that he
had not taken care of <br>
properly staffing the place for the evening - he only had one bartender
due in, instead of the 3 required,<br>
he had not followed through on getting 2 coat-check people, even his bar
backs were unavailable.<br>
We had handled security - including an extra person to keep drinks from
going out on the roof deck.<br>
Nothing we had done or were willing to do was going to change his
mind.<br><br>
Our opinion on anyone ever working with this owner again should be
obvious.<br><br>
Those of you who know or understand the logistics of putting on an event
of this size can appreciate<br>
that we had already spent several thousand dollars worth of unrecoverable
costs on this event - everything from <br>
getting tickets printed to a dozen jack-o-lanterns.&nbsp; Many of you
know that Lost Tribe Presents<br>
has been operating &quot;in the red&quot; for the past couple of years
because we absorbed the cost overruns<br>
from the Illuminaughty 2002 project at Burning Man.&nbsp; This
cancellation (the first in almost 7 years of<br>

!<br>
The most difficult aspect of putting on a legal late night event is
always finding a location -<br>

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RR: SPECTRE Review!(part 2)

As always it was a fabulous party at Otherworld. Toss in the addition of
Tenderloft to the mix and you got the double fisting of fun. That graveyard
that Marin created was awesome. The visuals setup with the rear-projection
onto parachutes made for a nice atmospheric feeling. Actually all the shutes
and curtains that broke up the main space was a blessing. The main room can
get a little thin and the way it was sectioned off kept the energy focused.

In all honesty I just ran around all night being goofy. That's what I was in
the mood for. Hanging out with friends in a super-fun atmosphere. I also
haven't been going out much lately. That break from things made the party
that much more enjoyable. It was great to see so many people I hadn't seen
in a while all in the same spot. It's these kind of parties that I solely
want to attend. I look forward to the next one, although I think the effort
that went into that party will be hard to top.

side note: On the way to Otherworld we stopped by Noodle Factory to see
Marshal and hear how things sounded (he got more gear!). I think that was
the most done up I've seen that place. Music - well - not my thing. But I'm
sure things were quite fun since they had all the rooms open. I hadn't seen
that occur in over a year. I miss the holes in the wall to climb through. =(

Well, for as long as I have been a dancer (years!) I still have trouble
identifying the various types of EDM, let alone the numerous DJs in the
scene.

So, I just let the music move me.

I gave up on wondering (or figuring out) who's playing what.

But your review was right on the money. Thanks for providing these details.

I just know that I couldn't stop dancing, all night long, and I kept running
back and forth between the rooms. Plus the D&B was some of the best I have
heard lately.

Also, the decorations had the Halloween spirit (for example, a graveyard in
the smoking room), and the vibe was incredible. I kept seeing people that I
know from all over the rave scene.

Seems to me that this crew really had their act together and they pulled it
off quite nicely. I had a big smile on my face all night long. I was the
happy dancer.

I just got back from Iraq, and I've served our country for several years now.  
I seriously doubt anyone's getting drafted.  So don't be pissing in your 
pants, or wasting your spit...  You're just wasting your time and the time of

By the way, I don't agree with the reasons we started this war either.  But 
I'm happy for the Iraqi people.  Most of the ones I ran into were very happy 
that we helped free them.

Before anyone else decides to call me a "pussy", I'll
post my response to Mr Triumph:

Now now- it has nothing to do with being a pussy-

If invaders were running down my street I'd be the
first on the ground with my 12ga in hand.
But not for this BS...
Not for some jackoff's fatherly-acceptance fantasy
played out in oil and blood hahah
I don't support my country's actions, and if push
comes to shove, I'll happily leave- thats all :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME SWEATING! Re: [sfraves] impending draft?

Does anyone REALLY think that people like me volunteer to risk their lives for 
their god, country or corps?!?!  I dunno bout other people, but I didn't!  I'm 
not about trying to help George W make up for his father's mistakes.  I 
volunteered coz I knew that my boys and gurrls are out there.  If something 
were to happen to them, and I knew that I didn't do anything to prevent it, I 
could never live with myself.  THAT is the REAL REASON some people volunteer 
to serve their country.

Its true...

Draftees make horrible soldiers.  Enlistment rates are holding up just

Unfortunately I do understand the need for military in this world but it
makes me no less disheartened at the scale it is used in this world.  I
have a friend about to join the army, and even though he knows the
concequences of the field he's going in to, it saddens me that we live
in a country where as a last ditch effort to gain money for college and
"direction" or "self-worth" we have people join the military.  Below is
just an observation.  If I'm wrong on anything please let me know.  I
like to be corrected.

We have 6 branches of the military. 1(yeah right) worldwide intelligence
agency, 6 majro nationwide intelligence and law enforcement agencies
and... ready.... 0.. not one. zip... zilch.. not a single governmental
agency devoted to true peacekeeping. All of our supposed peace keeping
organizations have to be non-governmental agencies like the Red Cross,
Salvation Army, Peace Corps etc... Debate if you will that it will cost
nothing but the tax payers heavily to have such a military sized force
devoted to humanitarian efforts to improve conditions in other countries
directly and solely for the purpose of peace and prosperity. Well, it
costs the tax payers heavily, including those part of it to run the
Army, Air Force, Marines, Navy, National Guard, Coast Guard, NSA, CIA,
FBI, US Marshall's, Secret Service, ATF, DEA and probably a few more
designed to destroy first, ask questions second. If I am wrong please
let me know but peace seems to be in the public's hands and almost
solely dependent on the publics generosity to devote time or money while
the government wants a large part of destruction with a little help
towards peace, usually handed out in tax breaks to peace organizations.
(Yes, I know that the military does good deeds, but they're also bred in
boot camp to become uncaring and unquestioning of superiors for conflict
resolution, not the spread of peace. Peace is not something learned at
gunpoint.)

impending draft?


Does anyone REALLY think that people like me volunteer to risk their
lives for 
their god, country or corps?!?!  I dunno bout other people, but I
didn't!  I'm 
not about trying to help George W make up for his father's mistakes.  I 
volunteered coz I knew that my boys and gurrls are out there.  If
something 
were to happen to them, and I knew that I didn't do anything to prevent
it, I 
could never live with myself.  THAT is the REAL REASON some people
volunteer 
to serve their country.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME SWEATING! Re: [sfraves] impending draft?

Rayn,
Your friend did not HAVE TO join the military.  He was not drafted.  No one 
held a gun to his head or twisted his arm to the point of breaking.  Money for 
college, direction and self-worth are just BENEFITS to serving in the armed 
forces.  They should not be the reasons why people sign up.  This is like 
saying you'd sign up to work in a funeral home as a embalmist just so you 
could have a free funeral benefit!  If people sign up for the wrong reasons, 
that's their own damn fault!  I'm just glad that there are still people out 
there that serve their country for the RIGHT reasons.

We officially have five branches of service in the military.  I didn't count 
the Guard and reserve because when they are activated, they are integrated 
into the other branches.  There are now 14 agencies in the US Intelligence 
Community.  These agencies either specialize in intelligence, or have 
personnel that perform an intelligence function.

You are right!  I totally agree with your statements on peace-keeping.  How 
can you expect people that are trained to kill & destroy to be effective peace-
keepers?  If I was president or a member of Congress, I'd draft a bill to 
allocate funding to the Peace Corps.  They NEED a bigger budget!  We don't 
even pay those poor bastards!  THey need to get paid for the services they 
provide!  Give them a bigger budget, reorganize, equip them, train them, and 
make the Peace Corps do the peacekeeping duties!

Let the trained killers & destoyers do what they're trained to do, and leave 
the peace-keeping to dedicated peace-keepers!

So yeah, this proves that sexual insecurity is the cause of all war!!!

As George Carlin says, its why all the missles, bombs and bullets are shaped

but what percentage do actually sign up for those reasons?  remember the
ads for the armed forces - "Be all you can be"?  those ads emphasized the
reasons you state - the armed forces became just another job, a badly paid
one, as i understand it (but that is a different issue)

well, i'm certainly supporting your attitude here, it seems like the right one.
but i have a problem with the executive branch using the military as a 
political
tool (for ultimately domestic issues).  the death of everyone in Iraq is on
GWB's head and i think they were needless deaths.  sure, something had to
be done, but i do not like being lied to about the motivations.

You are right!  I totally agree with your statements on peace-keeping.  How

according to the veterans i know of the Peace Corp, it's a gigantic boondoggle.

as for the draft, there was a recent story in the SFBg (or SF weekly) about
how the gov. strongarmed the local school districts into giving them info
on high school seniors etc.  this has been happening across the country.
i don' t like what it portends

Therefore I have heard of military operations that were clumsy but swift, but 
I have never seen one that was skillful and lasted a long time.  It is never 
beneficial to a nation to have a military operation continue for a long time.

Dick Cheney's company Halliburton (and its subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root - 
KBR) profiting immensely from the involvement in Iraq. What a bunch of 
slime-heads.  

So, what are we doing about it? Talking among ourselves is great, but how can 
we translate our thoughts into action? Will it make any difference? I haven't 
given up hope.

wow!  15" is pretty big for personal use [no matter
what peeps say].  these speakers [jbl or mackie] sound
great in a personal studio with no more than 12"s.  i
have a pair of 12" vintage jbl's and have no need for
more sound...and they aren't self powered!  you could
save some money by downsizing the drivers...unless you
have plans of these speaks leaving your house/ studio,
for, lets say, the CLUB!  anyway...just my opinion..

Mackies, mos def.  The nice thing about them is they'll go ungodly loud
and they make them with little coloration, a little bit more like
studio monitors than PA speakers.

The JBL stuff is ok, but the EONs and the like have always seemed a
little bass-light.  SRM 450s are sweet, portable, and not so much money
you'll be crying.

Cheers,
George C.

Well, I guess if these invaders will actually breed a hardier race, a la 
Darwin, I say let them have at it:)

I love quotes.  Especially from famous American generals.  Here's one from 
another general:

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired 
signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not 
fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not 
spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius 
of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at 
all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a 
cross of iron.
--Dwight Eisenhower 1953 speech

Love,

Apollo

citation or its failure to renew Rawhide's license in accord with the =20=

time frame given in the citation. Government agencies don't like to be =20=

held to the same standards as ordinary businesses when it comes to =20
improper action and negligence.

	Your caution against other promoters working with Rawhide's =

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: EQUIPMENT: Self-Powered Monitor's

  It depends what you are looking for. Both Mackies
and JBL's are great, but for different reasons. 

 Personally I think the JBL's sound better. The mids
are cleaner, plus if you get the newer G2's they have
high and low eq's (Mackies don't offer this). I have
four of them, two for my dj set up in my studio, and
two for gigs. I LOVE them. Couldn't be happier.

 If you are more concerned with volume then I would
recomend the Mackies. They do have smaller drivers
with 12 " woofers rather then 15's like the Eon's, but
they are capable of being pushed to much higher volume
levels than the JBL's. I personally find them lacking
in the mid range though. They seem to be all highs and
lows to my ears. That is just my personal oppinion
though.


 Basically it just depends what is more important to
YOU. Sound quality or volume. Either way you decide to
go you will have a great set of moniters as both
brands are top notch.

 Hope that helps.


 Kevin James

I'm not sure if this'll help you at all, but pioneer does make a 19" version
of the 600, called the 3000.

Go to http://pioneerprodj.com/, there's info there.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] impending draft?

	If the military didn't offer benefits such as money for college, they 
wouldn't be able to fill their recruitment quotas. I was in the Army 
reserves and I didn't meet anyone who wasn't trying to maximize his or 
her personal benefits, nor anyone who seemed to be primarily motivated 
by a desire to serve his or her country.

	It wasn't always thus. During the Revolutionary War against England, 
when it was a clear fight for freedom, soldiers volunteered without pay 
in General Washington's army. Perhaps if the U.S. still had a 
citizen-run government which clearly stood for liberty not only in 
places like Iraq but here in the states as well, things would be 
different. Instead, most of the truly dedicated, patriotic folks were 
joining the anti-government militia movement, at least before the Feds 
put a lid on it via infiltration and crackdowns and the media tarred it 
by association with the likes of Timothy McVeigh.

	Who wants to go and fight for a big-government welfare state that 
taxes people worse than the British monarchy did, crushes innovation 
and creativity, and tries to tell you how to run your own life? Not me.

Peace, love & liberty,

Subject: [sfraves] Did anyone go to Lil' Monsters?

I found out, after I had already made plans for halloween, that Happy 
Kids was throwing another Lil' Monsters.  And I'm really curious as to 
how it went, who played, did it go all night, and so on.

Before they went on hiatus, I used to have a lot of fun at HK parties, 
and still have some really fond memories (and pictures) of them.  I 
even had a blast at that one ill-fated clusterfuck of a Lil' Monsters 
at that soccer arena place.  But as much as I wish them well, some of 
the things I have learned since, about what was going on "behind the 
scenes" at the time, have left me with a "wait and see" inclination 
before I start to go to their parties again.  (Ahhh.... ignorance can 
be such bliss sometimes...)

So, I really am curious as to how this Lil' Monsters went down.  Anyone 
care to enlighten me?

Thanks.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Why not have events all over north CA? like in this county

Additionally, getting permits in many of the less urban areas of 
California can be somewhat problematic. Outside of urban areas, and 
outside the bay area in particular, there is usually a less tolerant 
attitude towards electronic music and those in power generally 
associate electronic music with raves with "drug orgies" with NIMBY 
(Not in my Backyard).

Subject: [sfraves] rave docu circa 93? Re: [sfraves] http://www.groovethemovie.com (not up¿?)

there was a docu about raves that came out in 93 i think. it was about raves 
in the US and showed parties from just about every major city in the US that 
had raves at the time. it also interviewed dj's, promoters, ravers. now, 
that was a COOL movie. it really showed the potential the scene at the time 
had, and it was b4 there were any division's in the scene; i.e all the music 
was the same. no sub genres. it was house and hardcore, but both were played 
by all dj's interchangebly at the time anyways...
what was the title of that? was it, united states of rave? anyone? apollo?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ATP: EQUIPMENT: Self-Powered Monitor's

The 15 inch Mackies are real bargains for the hefty seeming price. (900.00
or more a piece)
 They have the same tweeter and are only 100 watts more, but the highs sound
good after 3 hours of pounding and there is some solid lows.
A big drawback is that it is not easy to lift 90 pounds onto a tripod.

Well, there's also Better Living Through Circuitry (1999). Good
flick... good music and a variety of people from both Europe and the
US. And definitely check out Human Traffic (1999) if you're on a rave
movie kick. 

And whenever you watch Groove... keep your eye out for Larry Ching's
cameo!

And the costumes were fan-fucking-tastic!!! So much variety... really
elaborate, really simple, really kinky, really sexy, really cute...
Everything from 2 sumo wrestlers to goths, anime characters to
dominatrices.

Ah... much eye candy for the costumer's soul. 

Otherworld & Tenderloft - AMAZING party. You guys have done it again...
Big thanks for creating such a fun-filled, family-ish atmosphere. It
was even wonderful SOBER. (Imagine that, ME - sober - all night.)

I didn't go but I talked to some people who said it was very good. It was 
held at a place in SF that might be seeing more parties in the months to come -- 
a nice venue. I had tons of fun at Lil Monsters in 1999. That one was awesome: 
 a mini-massive at a warehouse in Richmond that will never be used again. The 
next one had some problems but was still great. 
I wanted to check out this year's Lil Monsters but it said presale only, and 
I didn't think I could get to Skills in time. I went to Nightmare on Evo 
Street and had a fantastic time, so everything worked out fine. Later, i heard that 
Lil Monsters did have tickets at the door and that it went well, and I was 
glad to hear that. 
I'm still not sure what to think about the comeback of Happy Kids. I'm 
wishing them well, and hoping Lil Monsters is a good sign for their return.

Yes, Picard was fond...

I used to be stationed in the East Bay, in Alameda.  SF is my 2nd fave city in 
the whole wide world!  I go back there all the time, and my friends from over 
there come over to visit my city!  As a matter of fact, I just helped a friend 
from the Bay check into his hotel here in Times Square just now!  And I'll try 
to head over there after he leaves this Saturday...

from what i understand, the reason baby anne is so hot (i don't see it) is because she was a stripper when icey met her. 
the reason she sounds like icey is because he taught her to spin.
 
soo, ima have to go w/ icey on this one.
 
kieth mackenzie out of tampa blows them both away IMHO

I don't know, you can pick DJ Icey up at Hot Topic though, so he must be 
really really good.

no opinion on this but wanted to share a bit of trivia, thanks to Frankie 
Bones, who said in an interview that DJ Icey got his name because he keeps his 
home really cold. Has nothing to do with being a "cool guy" or drugs or anything 
else, just the temperature of his home. 

Speakin' of Ice, though ... lol ... anybody remember our own local "DJ Ice", 
Dan Smith from Novato?  He used to post on SFR. He threw a pretty decent party 
at the officer's club at Hamilton Field, and later on he threw an excellent 
underground in an abandoned building at the same base. We probably all got a 
lifetime's worth of asbestos:  there was so much whitish powder in the air that 
I couldn't even take flash pictures!  That was bad, and the shuttle system was 
terrible too (25 people packed into a single cargo van going up a bumpy 
road), but it was fun to go to a real live unauthorized party. The only way the 
cops found the party was by following the van. 

Ice, ice, baby  ;)

Icey is better IMHO, but they both suck serious ass next to Tony Faline.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ icey or Baby Anne  ?

I like both of them, but personally when I saw em live Baby Anne played
the better set... And she did not have a moustache ;)

My favorite guys out of Florida aside from Rabbit in the Moon but off
the same label are Jackal and Hyde (well maybe from Florida).  I went
back to Utah for Halloween and a party to see DJ Mea spin and had no
idea they were going to be there.  I remember sitting watching their
live PA and mentioned to one of my old friends, man, these guys sound a
lot like one of my favorites, Jackal and Hyde.  Some other dude was
like, this is Jackal and Hyde.  Seriously one of the best parties I've
ever been to.  Top floor of a warehouse with a huge elevator that made
me think of a Skinny Puppy video and meat grinders, but when we got up
top there was a grid of lazers shooting across the ceiling and smiles
and crazy costumes everywhere.  Great vibe, and although there were cops
patrolling the neighborhood and even just sitting outside the party, no
bust.

Who do you think is better at spin'n breaks? Or is there other DJ's with

Subject: [sfraves] free sound & lights rental

Hey all,

It is my slow season and I get depressed having all this gear gathering
dust.

I get off on doing illegal and or dangerous stuff,

Yet I fret

That there'n't nuf occasions to lug

 200-pound speakers

 down steep cliffs or sandy dunes much anymore.

funny, I used to complain, now I miss it.

Anyway back to reality.

I am an old veteran of the scene, yet you may never see me. I am an amp
sitter(sleeper) errand running fire putting out Show-Ho.

Give me a toss will ya?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ icey or Baby Anne ?

I dunno, I've seen both of em many times, and Icey's always been better (a 
bit too anthemic, but better). And you obviously have never seen that bitch 
up close, cuz she got a thicker moustache than me. I'm sure she knows what 
wax is tho....lol.

But I would definately agree, I'd much rather see Jackal & Hyde, Tony 
Faline, Gumbee, Huda Hudia, or maybe even Friction and Spice before I'd want 
to see either Icey or Baby Anne....way more talent in all of them.

yo,  1992, Baltimore, Ultraworld... this is where my
life changed 11 years ago (JFC, I'm old.  Yoiks!)  I
still read stories in the news now & again about
Lonnie Fisher doing battle with the cops.

Subject: [sfraves] Ultraworld revisited

yo, while waxing nostalgic about that Ultraworld /
Balti-bore post,  I dug up this old story.  I posted
it years ago so like, sorry andy.  :o)

those were some good times for me when it was all
fresh and exciting and new worlds were opening up.

peace,

.....

"Back East"
by boomerang fidget
  
I haven't been back east in five years.   In
Baltimore, I was an old school freak.  Always busting
out the headspins on the dancefloor, mackin on the
ladies and all of that.

But one night 5 years ago, all of that changed.   I
was at this Ultraworld party one night, busting out
the boomerang tricks.  You already know I was
impressing the ladies, but what you prolly don't know
is that I had just eaten a 5-alarm chili dinner. 
Well, I was out there on the floor trippin my electric
funk hips all over the place, when I cut loose with
the most horrific fart ever.  

It was awful!  The dancefloor cleared, as bodies
climbed over bodies in desperate search for exits. 
The needle skipped off the record and Scott Henry
tumbled ass-over-microchip from the dj booth.   

The fire marshal was called to evacuate the building,
and swarms of journalists arrived, breaking what would
become the first press on this new threat to our
nations youth.

In shame, I went home and packed my bags.  In the
morning I caught the first bus to San Francisco.  I
could start my life over on the west coast, a shadow
of my former self.  

It took me years to come to terms with my suffering.  
At my peak I had been the rave mack daddy, scoring all
the ladies and trippin nutwax on the dancefloor.  But
in the course of a few fleeting moments, all of that
had been lost, slipped away like water though my
fingers. 

In California, I parked it down low and stayed deep
underground for years. The Happy Kids crew took me in
like family, but they never knew about my sordid past.
  Every once in a while when the fire marshal would
show up to make sure things were under control, I felt
the darkness in my heart.

Last week,  I decided to go Back East.  I'm sure that
my old friends presumed me dead, or had simply
forgotten about me.  But I went home, to face the
demons.  Surely no one would remember that moment 5
years ago, when I had caused so much embarrassment on
the dancefloor! Surely, people would have moved on to
other things! 

My first night home, I went out to a party. 
Thankfully, I didn't recognize anyone.  This  was a
brand new crowd of ravers!  Soon, I became more
relaxed in my old environment, and started grooving on
the new music.  I realized that the DJ, too, was a
fresh face. 

I said to this kid next to me, "I've never seen that 
DJ before.  How long has she been spinning?"

"Well,"  the kid said. "She spun at her first
party...let's see...three years, two months, and five
days after Boomerang Fidget cut that big fart on the
dancefloor."

Subject: [sfraves] Oliver Bondzio -- Anyone know dis dude?!

In case of.. Oliver Bondzio (cd)
German techno at its finest!
I love that motherfucker.. He is one of the two members of hardfloor. His
mix cd is so fuqn sick! It has always been some of my favorite german
techno. The second to last track is Mathematical Breakfast, by Oliver
Bondzio himself, one of my favorite techno tracks. Anyone here know of
this mugg and care to recommend some similar stuff? I need to get myself
some nice new techno beats.. I've been listening to oldschool NYC Techno
like DJ DB (before he spun drum&bass) and german techno the last couple of
days..

Sorry for responding so late to these posts.  

Ironically, I remember an article about raves in the
Baltimore newspaper back in the early '90s. 
Ultraworld came under a lot of heat for a New Years
flyer that featured Uncle Sam wearing a pot leaf on
his jacket.  

of course the controversy was about promoting (or
acknowledging) drug use at parties that UW was
promoting.   Lonnie Fisher called the pot leaf a
"stupid mistake," but he got a lot of bad press for
it.

peace,
bf

hi hak,

"Better Living Through Circuitry" fits the bill, and included interviews 
with the likes of Genesis P-Orridge (Psychic TV) and Keoki, but this was 
released, I think, in 1999.

Moontribe down in LA did some early filming of the desert rave scene but I 
don't think any of it was ever released except, perhaps, some 16mm footage 
in "Synergy: Visions of Vibe" released recently on DVD.

I also remember seeing some shorts made in the UK in the early nineties 
about the acid house rave movement in the UK, but they didn't cover the US.

Love,

Apollo

Doug,
Recruiters have been collecting information from high schools for years.  This 
is not a new phenomenon.

Frank

A government should not mobilize an army out of anger, military leaders should 
not provoke war out of wrath.  Act when it is beneficial, desist if it is 
not.  Anger can revert to joy, wrath can revert to delight, but a nation 
destroyed cannot be restored to existence, and the dead cannot be restored to 
life.  Therefore an enlighteneted government is careful about this, a good 
miltary leadership is alert to this.  This is the way to secure a nation and 
keep the armed forces whole.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME SWEATING! Re: [sfraves]  impending
 draft?

I said 'strongarming', not collecting.  The school districts based their 
logic on
privacy concerns and then the gov. made threats regarding educational funding.

that's a little different than "we'd like to set up a table at the next job 
fair"

the overall thing i am concerned with is the possible growing 
militarization of
american culture.  ok, you scoff, but this is a slow and subtle phenomena, so
it just doesn't happen like "poof!".  the "America! Love it or leave it!" 
and "the
president is always right!" crowd have been steadily gaining more influence
over the past 20 years.  e.g. nowadays, stuff like FOX News is blithely 
accepted
Where are these trends leading us?

Guest:

founder of primalsounds.com

Carl Saunders
UK

Carl was introduced to the underground dance music scene in 1995 and was
instantly hooked on the DJ line. His enthusiasm and inquisitiveness of
dance music have always been constantly high and ultimately led Carl to
play many varied events across the UK.

Carl began by co-promoting and DJing at local events for students. These
events proved extremely popular and it was not uncommon to see
gatecrashers enter by window. For the duration of his college life he
presented his own weekly dance music show on the college radio station and
to mark the end of his college years, he co-promoted a 1000-capacity event
and warmed up for worldwide DJ Danny Howells.

Local promoters "Technosis" were the first to take an interest in Carl's
DJing, and after fulfilling many guest spots, Carl is now a firmly
established resident at this thriving night of underground Techno-Trance
in the heart of Hampshire's countryside! In 1999, Carl started his
residency at "The Voodoo Lounge" (Leicester Square), London, playing a
fortnightly three-hour Funky House set along side Ben Cherrill and Luke
Neville (Manifesto Records). Aside his two residencies, Carl has played
many guest spots at clubs in Southampton, Bristol, Guildford, London and
Nottingham (Media) to name a few.

His love for dance music is reflected in PrimalSounds.com, established and
run by Carl.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"It is not the same to talk of the bulls as to be in the bullring."
-Spanish Proverb

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 7 deadly sins revu - excellent

7 deadly sins was fantastic - what a great space, great decoration, good 
music (NOT trance) - dj assault and baby dady spun great booty, the techno 
prior was good too, a breaks room, free water, etc. - nice crowd, not too 
underaged... all around good, almost restores my faith in the underground 
;)!

This Thursday I'll be back San Francisco to help raise money for a
really good cause. The funds raised from this benefit are going directly
to help house a 24 year old woman and her 20 month old daughter. If you
have the time and can spare the ten spot, then I'd love to see you
there. And if you can't go to dance, then perhaps you can drop them a
contribution (see  <http://www.1-by-1.org/> website for details). This
one is legit and it's doing wonders for familys...


1-by-1 and Maximum Productions present:

RAISE THE ROOF 

Party for a night and house a family for a year!

Featuring:

Dragn'fly (11:00pm - 1:00am)
Lick the DJ
and more...

plus... beatboxing by Z-Rox


at Cloud 9
34 7th Street @ Market
$10 cover
21+

For more information visit: 

 <http://www.1-by-1.org/> http://www.1-by-1.org

Raise the roof at Cloud 9 and help end homelessness in the Bay Area, one
family at a time. 

Break the cycle. 
We find families a stable place to live, helping to break the cycle of
homelessness. 

In for the long haul. 
We work with families, over a period of time, until they become self
sufficient. 

Every penny counts. 
All donations go directly to supporting the families we serve. 

Helping those who help themselves. 
Our families are motivated, drug free, and willing to work to help
themselves. 

Fill in the gap. 
Our families pay for part of their own rent and expenses - we fill the
gaps. 

At the event, you will be helping Amy and her 20 month old daughter
Julia. If we can fill CLOUD 9, we can provide housing for Amy and Julia
for a whole year. 

Come Raise the Roof!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GOS - WAS --> rave docu circa 93? 


Holy sh*$ and the memories come flooding back fast!.. I actually have the 
flyer, one of the biggest of it's time, from a party (i believe the original 
venue was busted and it was moved to DV8, if I remember correctly) and 
called GOS where they showed that Generation of Sound film... I think it was 
the 'Juice' guys (Noel, Buck, Josh and company..) What an incredible time to 
be part of the growing SF scene.. and behind the post office.. damn.. 
another incredible set of memories.. I bought all my Fresh Jive gear there.. 
FJ was my sh*$ then. I was definately an FJ label whore, I mean damn that 
sh*$ was fresh!

I have that flyer scanned if anyone wants to see it, mail me and I'll shoot 
it over. Strait History baby. A nice trip back in time..

works, but the concept is pretty cool!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Midi turntable

I remember seeing this thing at Macworld SF last year. It was pretty 
weak at the time. Horrible latency issues plagued his demonstrations. 
If my faded memory serves correct, he didn't even have the Mac version 
with him at the time. Not a huge deal overall, but if you're demo-ing 
your product at the premier Mac trade show, you ought to have your Mac 
version with you.

Hopefully it's better by now.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

Here's my all time classic lineup, 1996 in Chicago:

Derrick Carter
Joey Beltram
Stacey Pullen
Mike Dearborn
The Surgeon
DJ Hell
Diz
Claude Young
Robert Armani

Two djs from overseas, three more from out of state, and some of the best
Chicago had to offer, no fluff, all for $15.

The best house and techno lineup I've ever heard, off the hook!

Holy shit.. thats a sick ass party, i wish i was there.  I would love it if
you could send me a scan of the flyer.  I will put it on my server and send
the
link back out for anyone else to see.  I still miss the good onld days of
partying!

Holy sh*$ and the memories come flooding back fast!.. I actually have the
flyer, one of the biggest of it's time, from a party (i believe the original
venue was busted and it was moved to DV8, if I remember correctly) and
called GOS where they showed that Generation of Sound film... I think it was
the 'Juice' guys (Noel, Buck, Josh and company..) What an incredible time to
be part of the growing SF scene.. and behind the post office.. damn..
another incredible set of memories.. I bought all my Fresh Jive gear there..
FJ was my sh*$ then. I was definately an FJ label whore, I mean damn that
sh*$ was fresh!

I have that flyer scanned if anyone wants to see it, mail me and I'll shoot
it over. Strait History baby. A nice trip back in time..

First off, EJ works fine (when I saw it in spring of this year at least).
I've seen it, had a chance to lay hands on it and play, etc.  Cool stuff!

In a similar sorta vein, you should check this out...

http://www.mspinky.com/

I'm fairly involved with the project (my old bedroom in Sunnyvale was a
testing ground for it, and I demo'd it as this year's NAMM convention).
It comes with a stand alone app that works in a similar fashion to other
mp3/audio file turntable controls but that's not the sick part.  It also
comes with a max/msp interface object, which allows you to use a turntable
to apply accurate low latency/high precision control to anything max does
(visuals, midi, custom applications, robotics, etc).

A modern Mac with a decent audio interface can do realtime blending of two
movies (mixing, chromakey, whatever) with each movie controlled by a
seperate turntable... weird stuff mang!  And audio out if it is *tight*,
you can use it for scratching, beatmatching, all sorts of mixing, etc.

Available at $99 for the standalone version (vinyl and basic playback
software only) or in pricier packages with Max/MSP (a popular experimental
audio programming language that I use for live and studio work) or
Max/MSP+Jitter (Jitter being the visuals add-on pack to Max, for those who
know this is what Mike uses for the syncronized visual brainfuckery in our
BiPole sets).

This site describes the package deals, as well as a good overview of what
it all looks like/works like.

Hi,

Why is it that the ones you really care about, have feelings for, and treat 
like a princess stomp on you?

I honestly don't know.

The one I want "doesn't know what she wants" right now.  And I just moved to 
Davis, which is made up by about 70% hot college girls, so...

She knows where I live if she has any change of heart.

Sorry for the rant. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Girls fucking suck.

Well, part of it is if you try to treat them too well, they may think that
you don't have a 'backbone'. Often times, if you're too nice, girls treat
you like shit. If you're a "dick" or rather, don't pay quite as much
attention to them, they seem to fight for your attention more. They may
think that you have more going for you, are more confident, or are less
of a spinless suck up if you're a bit of a "dick", but thats not to say
you should be mean to them. I've read a few things about this, and it
often mentions if you are too nice you may seem spineless. Or maybe, if
she is really hot, she is just simply young and full of herself and thinks
she is too good for you. Basically, bro, my advice to you is pop your
collar and keep it moving. If you are letting her stomp on you and not
doing anything about it, you lack pride. That is never a pretty trait. A
weak little man that can just get shit on. Stand up for yourself, have a
spine. If you got a lot of shit going for you, there will be others. If
you carry yourself with pride and confidence, girls will admire that. Be
confident in yourself, or change what you don't like about yourself. You
can always work on yourself whether it be social aptitude, muscle build,
penis size, whatever the fuck is making you lack confidence. Do your
thing bro, don't let her get to you too much, as hard as it is. Go get
semi-drunk with a bunch of your friends and talk to some other young
pretty girls. If she is feeling like this, she is possibly talking to
other guys. I dunno bro, my heart goes out to you. I know what its like to
really be into a fine girl. It can mess with a guys head more than
anything and bring out uglier sides in him, such as sucking up and
forgetting about his own pride! Hit me up if you bothered reading this and
found it to be the least bit helpful, which I hope it was. I'm stoned and
ranting..

peace

I got a bunch of stuff on mp3 and/or cd by most of those artists.. If you
wanna talk sh0p, electronic music wise, hit me up brotha. I already love
you style in music if thats your favorite lineup :) I have lots of
good recommendations, and possibly stuff to feed you (mp3). Hey, check out
the cd -- Oliver Bondzio, In case of... -- Fucking SICK german techno. He
is one of the two members of hardfloor. Nothing that recent, couple of
years old, but an incredible fucking CD and I was just listening to it the
other day, which I why I mention it.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR (ranting about love for EDM and networking with fellow EDM heads)

I'm an electronic music head til the day I die
Electronic music has healed my soul many times
I owe a great deal to electronic music

I'm going to promote it and contribute to it as much as I can
for the rest of my life

Anyone care to help?!

Anyone care to discuss good shit with me? Recommend shit, trade some
music, and whatever else..

I don't want to trade any cds that artists release, or anything else
illegal
Just live sets, or clips, or whatever the fuck

Anyways, if you have a recorded cd on your hard drive for 24 hours and
then delete it, its legal, or some shit, I believe..

So?! Mofoz, please do hit me up if you share the love for EDM that I do?!

I'm mostly into Techno, House, Jungle, and some Breaks, although I'd like
to expand my Breaks collection of live sets! I am into some trance, but I
try to stay away from that crap and progressive, although there is still
some very good trance and progressive!

As an occasional post-er and frequent read-er of this wonderful list, I =
would like to ask everyone who has had the benefit of seeing the new =
matrix to please not ruin it for the rest of us..sorry that's about as =
nice as I can say it...I want to see the movie very badly, as I am sure =
others do also, and I hate having surprises ruined especially on a good =
movie. I plan on spending my life savings to see it at the Metreon, =
which is where I saw the previous 2.=20

Now if say, we were talking about the new "How to lose a guy in 10 days" =
sequel, by all mean shoot it from the hip. ;)

thanks for your understanding.

hmm...  seems that caps are back in fashion.

if you haven't seen it, refrain from reading emails that contain

it's a nice, easy and lower-case way of not ruining the movie for you and
keeping the whinging down for the rest of us.

would only be wise to absolutely pack the fucking place with =
SFR-citizens and then at 10 if "mr. promoter" show's up, we all bounce =
and clear the place out (remember the gold club is right across the =
street, hee hee)...I think that would send a nice message to the =
management.

Well, regardless, I'll be there; Come have a pint.=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: BSP: Matrix. If you have seen it please read.

Attention all people who have not seen the Matrix part 3 yet and would NOT
like to have it spoiled.... my request is simple... if you do not want it
spoiled then DO NOT read threads/posts/emails that have anything regarding
the Matrix or Revolutions in the subject line..... i dont think i can say it
more polite then that...

if i respond to an email regarding the matrix, and i say something about how
Neo works with the machines to restore peace, then it is your own damn fault
for reading it, you should have known by the subject line that it would have
information regarding the movie!

i am not responsible for your stupidity!

As an occasional post-er and frequent read-er of this wonderful list, I
would like to ask everyone who has had the benefit of seeing the new matrix
to please not ruin it for the rest of us..sorry that's about as nice as I
can say it...I want to see the movie very badly, as I am sure others do
also, and I hate having surprises ruined especially on a good movie. I plan
on spending my life savings to see it at the Metreon, which is where I saw
the previous 2.

Now if say, we were talking about the new "How to lose a guy in 10 days"
sequel, by all mean shoot it from the hip. ;)

thanks for your understanding.

Yeah... and then Trinity drops her towel and you see that she's really a guy! 
 Omigod!  So she and Neo are really brothers.  They do look a lot alike, 
except that she's more butch. 


Even if characters are killed in movies, what does it mean? Characters are 
brought back to life all the time. Didn't Morpheus die in the first Matrix? 
Wasn't a whole season of "Dallas" actually a dream? 
I heard that Carrot Top was going to be the star of a new series of Matrix 
movies.

Subject: [sfraves] DMT DIMITRI at (((THUMP))) this saturday in san francisco...beessspee

aloha all,

hope all are well.  in case you hadn't heard who is headlining (((thump))) 
on saturday at the dna, it is the one and only DIMITRI.  as most of you know 
we generally book live acts for thump, as there are very few international 
trance artists that can truly stand on their own as just DJs.  while dimitri 
is an accomplished producer with the good, the bad and the ugly (which is 
dimitri, dado/deedrah, and serge of total eclipse/antidote - which is a 
*ridiculous* line-up that we're working on for a future party), he is 
ostensibly the best trance DJ in the world, IMHO.

part of what makes him one of the, if not the, best trance djs in the world 
is his experience with the international scene since its inception.  he gets 
it and he knows how to convey it.  that plus his personal relationships with 
the best producers in the world for 15 years that give him all new tracks to 
light it up with.  that plus his innate sense of programming - building the 
perfect journey.  that plus he's been beat matching in the trance scene for 
many years when others were still crashing DATs together at 155bpm.  ;)

at any rate, DIMITRI has never disappointed me with one of his sets.  he is 
a gentle person and is truly one of the gems of the scene - but don't let 
that fool ya, he's a ripping hard DJ with wicked, wicked-good, 
wicked-whacked music that won't be coming out for months or years.

also we've got the head of maia records, arturo, up from mexico city (our 
first mexican DJ/act ever - very excited to support our brothers of the 
north american scene!), plus dutch and the thick progressive beats of kepi 
and the beautiful voice of kat to start the evening.  
drum'n'bass-breakz'nfunk upstairs with felix, cosmic selector (live), and 
android.

i missed wizzy so i'm looking forward to a damn good time this saturday.  
won't you come out and play?

for more info und zee presales:- http://www.thumpradio.com/thumpparty.cfm

peace, trance, and thump,

-bri

yeah, i wasnt going to respond since i already pointed out in a couple =
of other emails how i was joking when i said that..... but yes, molly is =
correct, its a fucking joke..... Neo does not die and they do not show =
anything that would lead you to believe that Neo and Trinity are =
related....=20

its a funny thought though... seriously, so many fans would be pissed =
off if what i said were true, which is why i said it.... because most =
fans SHOULD KNOW that the Warchawski (sp?) brothers would not have given =
the whole Matrix series such a whack ending....

but like i said to Jack Triumph; if you do not want to know about the =
movie, then why the hell are you reading this post? it says straight up =
in the subject line that it is about the Matrix, isnt that enough to =
warn you not to read it? i mean shit, that should be common sense....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DMT DIMITRI at (((THUMP))) this saturday in san francisco...beessspee

I would have to guess he is talking about the dimitri from the
ThumpRadio.com website, no?

But, I would like to point out that dimitri has to be one of the most used
dj names, so it's easy to say "Dimitri from Phoenix?" "No, it's Dimitri from
Minneapolis." There are a lot of them, perhaps (to tie into the jerky's who
keep ruining the matrix for the rest of us) Agent Smith's in disguise. No
dis, just an observation. I have no opinion either way.

Although thank you thump radio for putting something good on the FM band ...
You guys are like the neo's against the machines out there.

Sorry little bitter about folks who like to ruin good movies, by giving it
away.

I'd probably end up dead (with a big ass grin stuck on my face)... that's

lineup is way more techno than house, I'm cool with more house too)!  Why

I miss Martin's parties where he'd have Jon Williams and Stacey Pullen at

OH SHIT!!! I would give my, um... Well, I would give something cool to have 
been there in 1996. I had been collecting records for a while in 96' but 
going to parties was just a brand new thing to me. Thats the best line-up 
I've ever heard of. In Chi-town no less... =D I probably would have died 
too...

I was even thinking of Deejay Dmitry (sp?) from Deee-Lite, as I know he was 
spinning at parties around 1999 or so. 
Quite a popular name. Maybe "Dimitri" is to DJ names as "Tigger" is to candy 
kid names.

Jack, prob. see you at the Thirsty Bear this evening. I work near there.

its a funny thought though... seriously, so many fans would be pissed off if what i said were true, which is why i said it.... because most fans SHOULD KNOW that the Warchawski (sp?) brothers would not have given the whole Matrix series such a whack ending....

but like i said to Jack Triumph; if you do not want to know about the movie, then why the hell are you reading this post? it says straight up in the subject line that it is about the Matrix, isnt that enough to warn you not to read it? i mean shit, that should be common sense....

Subject: [sfraves] Tonight - Bad Kitty, BAAAAADDDDDD KIIITTTTTTTYYYY (bsp)


The even polite and charming mangement at Bad Kitty has cordially invited
me and anybody who cares to be within earshot to pound the pussy properly
tonight.  I'm dusting off some old classics, oddities and genre spanning
rarities for this one.  Should be a very funky, fun, fuckedup set for
those who like it rough and need a little release before the weekend.

So c'mon down, pour a couple drinks down your piehole and hoedown with the
dirty kids ghettohiptechnohopbreakretrobootyindustrialhouse80srocknut
style.

Not quite sure when I'll be playing (11-ish?) but it I'm sure you'll have
ample time for downtempo, fingertapas unt bierguzzlin at ThirstyBear
beforehand (which now wraps up at 10pm and is just a few blocks away!).

     Ok.... so how about a real review. So it has a awsome CG battle scene 
with the sentinals and the mech soldiers, that alone was worth my $5 matinee 
ticket, the scenes where the young kid has to reload the mech and open the thingy 
were kind of touching, & it was actually sad when trininy ... towards the 
end. i actually noticed people sniffling in the theatre. I like the last flying 
rain battle between super enhanced oracle/smith and neo in his last stand. The 
flying exchange of punches was so Dragonball-esk. So did anyone notice the 
blatent holy grail image in the matrix in the begining credits? or how about the 
blatent cross of light inside neo when he ...? Does anyone know what 
"Merovingian" really means? look it up. Anyways I like how the film starts out as 
everything you know about the your world is a lie, then it ventures into there are 
greater problems at hand. Such as the war with the robots in the real world. 
The robots were consequently products of man's own sin and selfishness, where 
as in the End Neo must battle his great opposite anti-neo like character and 
sacrifice himself in order to save man from the product of thier own sin. I mean 
it's not exactly a bible movie or anything of that sort but I like how it 
borrows ideas from many religions, myths & philosophies to the extream point 
where a fundementalist christian might think of the movie as a heresy, untill at 
the end you see the cross of light and neo laying crusified style being 
recycles back into the computer mainfraim. as if to say haha the whole idea was 
christian after all... iono i mean if they didn't want people think to of it as 
christian why did they put the cross of light and the holly grail into the movie? 
I mean it's not "bible" christian but it's like "gnostic" christian ideas 
like from the dead sea scrolls, that kind of stuff. I could go on & on, iono why 
none of the other movie reviews ever talk about this but i think it's really 
blatent in the movie. it's cool tho because weather or not you like or 
understand the message you still get your money's worth in the special effects and 
action and drama of the movie. - johnny

Subject: [sfraves] Nationalism and how to successfully oppose it (was Re: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME...)

Doug,

	I have a theory. You may not like it.

	There is a term that sums up the trends you are talking about 
(militarization, "love it or leave it," "the president is always 
right," etc.) These are all elements of nationalism. Like other forms 
of collectivism, nationalism is extremely dangerous. Along with racism 
and state socialism it was the backbone of Nazi ideology in Hitler's 
Germany.

	In the United States however, many of those who oppose nationalism 
have lost credibility since the 1960s. Why? Because they continue to 
put most of their energy into advocating a discredited and unworkable 
philosophy of wealth redistribution and economic micromanagement.

	During the past 20 years, the Soviet empire has collapsed. Statist 
regimes like those in North Korea and Zimbabwe continue to act as 
factories of poverty and human rights abuses. Meanwhile people living 
in free market oriented countries like Taiwan and Hong Kong have seen 
dramatic improvements in their lives. Other places like New Zealand, 
Ireland, and even "communist" China have seen dramatic benefits from 
free market reforms. Most of the European welfare states continue to 
stagnate. Around the world there is more and more evidence piling up 
that economic freedom works and government control and regulation 
doesn't.

	Most Americans are coming to realize that continued growth of 
government spending, programs, and taxes is simply not an option, and 
even what we have now is probably unsustainable. This realization 
didn't exist half a century ago. Back then it was widely believed that 
these trends could go on indefinitely, and that communism or something 
like it was the "wave of the future." Reality intervened with a sharp 
wake-up call. By the mid 1990s, even Bill Clinton was forced to 
acknowledge in a speech that "the era of big government is over."

	Unfortunately the federal government has become a runaway train. It 
kept growing under Clinton, and still keeps growing under Bush. More 
regulations. More spending. More people in prison. Thousands of new 
laws every year.

	And here is the danger: Any government big enough to do something for 
everybody and keep you safe from every possible danger is big enough to 
take everything away and throw *you* into a concentration camp. (Maybe 
they'll even recycle that saccharine slogan, "No child left behind.")

	Here's the decision facing anti-nationalists in the U.S.: Would you 
rather focus on dragging the failed ideology of Marx and Lenin into the 
21st century by advocating more and more government in order to "help" 
people? Or would you rather stop this country from becoming a police 
state?

Peace, love & liberty,
							<<< Starchild >>>

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Girls fucking suck.

Damn holmes,
    I made the same mistake a couple of months ago.  I started diggin' on 
this chick and we got down a couple of times and then I started to actually 
like her.  I started treating her really well and I even went to Hawaii to 
stay with her for a week.  Big mistake!  It ruined everything.  I guess what 
I am tryin' to say is that I feel for ya.  I know what it's like when you 
find a great person and then you treat them too well.  I've now realized 
that it's all about having fun and being nice to girls, but not breakin' 
your back for them.  As much as girls pretend that they want you to do 
everything in the world for them, if you don't show them that you are an 
insensitive male every once in a while, they just stop wanting you as much.  
I think the trick is a balance of being nice and sweet when they don't 
expect it and kind of being a man when they expect you to be a bitch.  Yeah, 
that's it...  She was a good booty, wasn't she?  I hate gettin' addicted to 
the booty!  Oh yeah, another brief side note, if you aren't sure if a girls 
into you, don't have slow sex with her.  Gets people all attached and causes 
fucked up emotional boundaries that y'all might not be ready for.  My 
advice, when you start a relationship out, nash as hard as you can to 
establish a meaningless foundation on sex.  I'm still babbling...
Joe.

I understand the latest version of Final Scratch/Traktor will output OSC 
which should allow it to be used with any OSC enabled software like 
Max/MSP, Reaktor, SuperCollider, Scream (my software), etc. Mmmmm... Of 
course this is in "theory"; verification pending...

"... Happy Birthday to You, the four-line ditty was written as a classroom
greeting in 1893 by two Louisville teachers, Mildred J. Hill, an authority
on spirituals, and Dr. Patty Smith Hill, professor emeritus of education
at Columbia University.  The melody of the song Happy Birthday to You was
composed by Mildred J.  Hill, a schoolteacher born in Louisville, KY, on
June 27, 1859.  The song was first published in 1893, with the lyrics
written by her sister, Patty Smith Hill, as "Good Morning To All."

Happy Birthday to You was copyrighted in 1935 and renewed in 1963.  The
song was apparently written in 1893, but first copyrighted in 1935 after a
lawsuit (reported in the New York Times of August 15, 1934, p.19 col. 6)

In 1988, Birch Tree Group, Ltd. sold the rights of the song to Warner
Communications (along with all other assets) for an estimated $25 million
(considerably more than a song). (reported in  Time, Jan 2, 1989 v133 n1
p88(1)

In the 80s, the song Happy Birthday to You was believed to
generate about $1 million in royalties annually.  With Auld Lang Syne and
For He's a Jolly Good Fellow, it is among the three most popular songs in
the English language. (reported in  Time, Jan 2, 1989 v133 n1 p88(1)

Happy Birthday to You continues to bring in approximately 2 million
dollars in licensing revenue each year, at least as of 1996 accounting,
according to Warner Chappell and a Forbes magazine article..."

The problem is, it seems that even when we elect people that come in
under the auspices of "no more big government!", they don't mean "no
more oppression" or "less nonviolent criminals in prison" - they mean,
"no regulation of businesses", "lowered capital gains taxes", "no more
checks and balances on capitalism", etc.  

All well and good for the corporate interests- but not at all
liberty-minded.  The right says they are for shrinking government, but
it seems they simply want to bleed social programs and award contracts
to their CEO friends, take away civil rights yet relax standards for
worker's quality of life, etc.  They want to bulldoze through countries
and simultaneously lower the wages of the brave people manning the
"bulldozers".

I may sound like a commie, but in this I'm more of a humanitarian.  I
want to see people taken care of, whether that means boosting education
so people can take care of themselves or keeping social programs
accessable to those who we've failed as a country to develop the
potential of.

So, to me, if I'm going to have to choose between somebody who wants
the government out of business's way under the guise of "liberty", and
somebody who'll keep schools, welfare and medicare funded, but who may
be more wasteful with money, I'll choose the latter.  Better to waste
in the process of providing care than to retain revenue and watch the
country fall (further) apart.  There is enough of an emphasis on money
in this country without the government, too, prioritizing it higher
than the right for its citizens to live with dignity and comfort.

There are few true libertarians that are well-supported and mainstream
enough to achieve high office- the American public fears change, which
means we're back to the old GOP-Dems crux time and time again. 
Overspending vs. Abandonment.

two cents in the swear jar,
George C.

Right... both Democrats and Republicans are making the governemnt bigger...
just in different places.

however, the Democrats, under Clinton, were able to pay for their big
government programs, and they ended the term with a surplus.

The Republicans, however, can't financially manage their big goverment, 
and have us sinking rapidly into an endless hole of debt.  Debt that us 
younger americans will have to bear the burden of for the rest of our life.

I am voting for the party who can financially manage their big goverment
spending.  

Becuase lets face it.. unless you vote Libertarian... big goverment is not
going anywhere.

!! WARNING WARNING !!

Plot holes enclosed.





Uhh, I'm slightly confused about this major plot hole that was introduced
in part three...

The entire premise for this series was that the machines could not get
power from the sun, and hence had to start harvesting power from humans...
Right...  okay...  Fine...  I don't think this strategy is really
worthwhile, but I can go along with it.

The scene where neo and trinity fly through the clouds and see the sun
(ooohh its soo pretty), shows that it is in fact possible to access the
sun, and it's energy.

I mean maybe they are AU (artificial unintelligence), or maybe they just
like to take the difficult road...  But uhh...  wouldn't it be easier to
make floating solar collectors, or satellites, or hell, even harness some
of that menacing lightning that seems to be everywhere all the time, than
to farm and harvest humans for thier body heat?

I still find it hard to believe that the human body generates more energy
than it takes in...  Yeah right we're all fusion reactors..  wheee.


matrix 3 boo hiss...  The only redeeming scene in the whole movie was the
attack, even though the AU machines thought it would be more effective to
fly around in pretty formations wasting time, than to actually swarm the
humans and eradciate them...  oh well...  I hate it when the 'enemy' gets
dummed down so much that they are not frightening anymore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nationalism and how to successfully oppose it (was Re: DON'T
 WASTE YOUR TIME...)


Republicans historically fudge up the country's finances before they leave 
office so the Democrat coming in has a shitstrom to deal with. They also 
like to start wars right before they leave too...

Republicans lick my asshole. Of course I'm biased, I lived in VA for a long 
time, and it's overrun with conservative fascist republican types...

"BEHIND THE BUZZ: DO THESE STREET DRUGS REALLY MAKE SEX BETTER?

LSD, Ecstasy, Steroids

LSD

HYPE: When LSD first became popular on the street, the drug was said to
turn your entire body into an erection, make sex last forever and create
orgasms that touched the cosmos.

STREET REP: After experimentation, many guys found that LSD was just as
likely to shrink your package to the size of a baby carrot--or at least
make you think it had.  Sex could be cosmic or comic.  Out-of-body sexual
experience was an oxymoron.  Caution, kids.

HYSTERIA: Rumors circulated that a medical study had found that LSD
damaged chromosomes, leading to the idea that recreational use might leave
you resembling a character drawn by R.  Crumb.  Or worse.

REALITY CHECK: "The early science about the drug's causing mutations
turned out to be bogus.  But the mere factoid popping up in the middle of
a psychedelic ascent could and did trigger countless bad trips," says
Ethan Nadelmann, head of the Drug Policy Alliance.  In other words, the
promised six-hour orgasm could become a three-day nightmare of torturous,
repetitive thoughts--such as, Oh, my God, don't let my kids grow up to be
Republicans.

MDMA

HYPE: As Jacob Sullum relates in Saying Yes: In Defense of Drug Use,
pharmaceutical giant Merck first synthesized MDMA ( better known today as
ecstasy ) in 1912.  But it wasn't until the 1970s that MDMA became popular
as a therapeutic drug.  Therapists reported that it produced feelings of
euphoria and empathy in patients and could "enhance communication and
insight." A leading proponent of the drug called it "penicillin for the
soul."

STREET REP: A person who distributed MDMA on the club scene in Texas
during the 1980s chose the name ecstasy because "he felt it would sell
better than a drug called empathy." The drug's street rep promised
enhanced sexual pleasure.  Time quoted one source who said the experience
felt like a six-hour orgasm ( what the hell is it with the six hours? ),
and crafty dealers started stamping white pills with sex.  Ecstasy became
known as the hug drug in part because of the feelings of affection it
caused.  But in many men it triggered impotence.

HYSTERIA: The Drug Enforcement Administration considers ecstasy the legal
equivalent of heroin ( a Schedule I drug ), invoking images of death by
overdose.  Indeed, the Drug Abuse Warning Network documents a handful of
MDMA-related deaths each year.

REALITY CHECK: Ecstasy impairs the body's ability to regulate temperature.
Ravers can die from overheating and dehydration.  Common sense says that
to play it safe, users should drink plenty of water, abstain from alcohol
and get off the dance floor every now and then.  Ironically, the rave
mantra "hydrate, hydrate" led to deaths by water intoxication--too much
water too quickly can mess up the sodium level in your blood and cause
your brain to swell.  That's not the part of your body you want to become
tumescent.  The guys in lab coats have reported that ecstasy causes
structural changes in the brains of raving rats that have been forced to
consume the drug for extended periods of time or in exorbitant amounts.
Studies involving humans are harder to read.  One shows impairment in
current users but not former ones.  Scientists have documented decreased
performance on cognitive or recall tasks executed by users.  The
government crusade against ecstasy, well intentioned as it may be,
obstructs attempts to self-regulate.  As it did during the 1960s, the
street takes better care of its own than the DEA does: ravers offer sample
testing to weed out counterfeit drugs, including those that may contain
the potentially lethal PMA.

STEROIDS

HYPE: Steroids enhance performance, maximize the effects of workouts, cut
recovery time and turn every weekend jock into Mr.  Olympia.

STREET REP: Few guys talk about the zits, the weird behavior or the sexual
side effects.  There is a widely told story about a weightlifter who
boasted about his chest, biceps and calf measurements but also admitted
that his testicles had shrunk to the size of peanuts.  Then there was the
steroid-crazed athlete who fucked a Coke machine.

HYSTERIA: Doctors have used steroids safely on patients since the 1930s.
It is only the specter of unsupervised use, coupled with uncorroborated
anecdotal evidence, that leads to crisis.  One of the common fears is that
steroid use messes with liver function and thickens the muscles of the
heart.

REALITY CHECK: Some weightlifters who use steroids have heart and liver
ailments.  But a 1999 study at the University of North Texas found that
steroids were not the cause.  Pump ridiculous amounts of weight even
without steroids, and you are likely to suffer liver damage and thickening
of the left ventricular wall of the heart.

Yoga, anyone? We hear it's great for sex..."   --

I'm still laughing over this article,

Hi, I'm trying to avoid the dreaded "cross-posting" but I do want to 
encourage people to go to this party if they can. Sound Asylum 4 was in SF but got 
shut down, and tomorrow (Saturday 11/8) there will be a makeup party in 
Sacramento.  It's in a permitted venue so there should be no worries about getting shut 
down. (Details below)

I know it's a bit of a drive to Sac from the Bay Area but I think it's going 
to be an excellent party!  Also, those of you who live in Sac or Yuba City or 
up in the hills somewhere, here's a good chance to go to an excellent party 
that's brought TO you instead of you having to drive to the Bay Area. 
Hope to see a lot of people there. 

A special CD release party for the long awaited arrival of "Hard Dance 
Sessions Volume One," a fully licensed 2-disc CD mixed by Steve Hill and DJ Denise 
(Tripoli Trax, Y2K Records, Neon Lights)

10-11 Keef vs. Danny Boy
11-12 Huey

Here's what my first calendar looked like:

Saturday, January 17, 2004 ** Cold Phusion Winter Music Festival by BR
Productions, Next Level Promotions, and KCRH 89.9FM **

 he COLD PHUSION Winter Music Festival! Line-up TEASER!!! COLD PHUSION
will feature over 40+ Artists performing on 4 MASSIVE stages of sound! THE
WARP BROS: The legendary Warp Brothers - DJ's Oliver Goedicke and J=FCrgen
Dohr. It did not take a long time and their first single Phatt Bass hit
the German market and made it to the top 3 in the dance charts! Shortly
after this they entered the Sales-Charts Europe wide up to the #2! No
wonder that they draw the music business attention, with placing a solid
techno-track in the sales-charts.Shortly after their uplifting style
flooded Europe, the wave swept over to the US, Canada, Australia and
Japan. You might somehow compare the style of the Warp Brothers to Prodigy
or Chemical Brothers but the truth is that they created their own creative
and unique sound, like you can read in an article of the Face magazine.
Although the Warp Brothers are friendly people - they are in possession of
a lethal weapon, which is called Harder House. Remarkable is their success
in the UK sales-charts #9 and Top 10 positions in several Sales -Charts.In
Denmark they were rewarded with gold. Undoubted the Warpies as they are
keenly called by their fans turn it up on stage! DJ DRC: San Francisco's
Pioneer DJ DRC has relocated to New York City and is geared up to take the
Electronic Music Industry by storm. With her Mixed Album "UNDEFINED" in
the works and a list of releases on IMIX, Vision Music, Off World, Merge,
Twin Soul and her own label Undefined Musik, DRC equivocates the
expeditious pace of her new stomping grounds. Her original music is also
featured in two movies, "Vision of Vibe" with Carl Cox and "Intellect"
being released this February 2003, featuring Paul Van Dyk and many others.
DRC's latest single SEEKER can be heard on the SPANKEE clothing line
websight. With all this under her belt and more, it is obvious DRC has
already had her finger on the pulse of the Big Apple/ Manhattan. DRC

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nationalism and how to successfully oppose it (was Re: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME...)

Just to interject a minor bit of common sense, the economic climate has been
vastly different between Bush and Clinton, that has much to do with surplus
or the lack thereof.  And if you can't see this and/or think Bush caused the
recession you really should brush up on basic macro-economics before
spouting about either party as it relates to fiscal issues and such.

>CHIRON is an essential component of the pattern

>Karma).  If we patiently take one step at a

>The above heavenly bodies are all what we call

>INTEGRATION OF MALE/FEMALE POLARITIES
>
>
>
>The masculine/feminine dynamic is a powerful
>factor in the astrological configurations of
>November 8th.   It is interesting to note that
>the Sun, Mars and Saturn are considered
>masculine planets and are in the feminine water

>There are 3 oppositions incorporated in the

>oppositions form an energetic interchange

>
>JUPITER/ MARS OPPOSITION

>Benefic Jupiter in Earth Mother Virgo grounds,

>
>
>
>MOON/SUN OPPOSITION
>
>The Moon in Taurus and the Sun in Scorpio work
>together to direct us towards wiser use of our
>individual and collective resources.  The North
>Node of the Moon conjunct the Moon makes sure
>that we notice that respectful use of our
>resources is a requirement that we can no

>
>
>
>CHIRON/SATURN OPPOSITION
>
>Chiron in Capricorn and Saturn in Cancer show
>us that caring and compassion form the most
>effective context for success in this world.
>
>
>
>The Saturn-Chiron and the Jupiter-Mars
>oppositions indicate a reconciliation of
>father/son energies and a realignment of the
>establishment and the powers that be.  This
>further supports and influences a planetary
>shift in consciousness.
>
>
>
>There are other dynamic alignments supporting

>THE LUNAR ECLIPSE
>
>
>
>Eclipses are evolutionary events that influence
>us months before and after the event.  They
>create energetic openings that support quantum
>shifts in consciousness.  LUNAR ECLIPSES are
>super Full Moons.  They empower us to let go of
>aspects of the past that no longer serve us and
>realign our values.  SOLAR ECLIPSES are super
>New Moons.  They embody the energy of a new
>beginning as well as the completion of a
>previous cycle.
>
>
>
>This total Lunar Eclipse adds an immense charge
>and significance to the Grand Sextile.  It
>energizes this beneficent configuration with a
>massive infusion of both lunar and solar
>energies.
>
>
>
>Lunar Eclipses mark a pivotal turning point in
>a cycle or a milestone in a sequence of events.
>  In Taurus/Scorpio, the Full Moon Eclipse
>"provides a focal point for the potential
>alchemical transformation of physical reality,
>as we know it."  (*4)
>
>
>
>Eclipses in one polarity usually continue for
>one and a half to two years.  However, the
>Taurus/Scorpio eclipses extend from November
>2002 through April 2005.  Six months ago there
>was total Lunar Eclipse at 24 degrees
>Taurus-Scorpio.  This was energized by Neptune,
>which was stationary that day as it turned
>retrograde.  Neptune retrograde gives us the
>space to examine whether our inner reality
>consists of illusions or divine connection.
>
>
>
>There are eclipses in Gemini/Sagittarius
>(November 23) and Aries/Libra during the same
>time period.  This gives us 2 and half years to
>examine Taurus/Scorpio issues, which focus on
>the use of both our personal and collective
>resources.  We are being asked to seriously
>examine how we use the Earth's resources.  A
>transformation of attitude and policy from
>exploitation, waste and depletion to
>conservation, renewal and sustainability is
>urgently required.
>
>
>
>
>
>THE SCORPIO/TAURUS DYNAMIC
>
>
>
>Scorpio specializes in intense evolution. Scorpio initiates us through 
>catharsis, death,
>rebirth and renewal.  It deals with crisis,
>conflict, life and death issues and with life
>and death itself. (*5)   Scorpio obliges us to
>get to the bottom of issues, to face the hard
>truth, to expose corruption, hidden agendas and
>dishonesty and to clean up what is out of
>integrity.  Scorpio embraces confrontation as a
>means to connect with our deepest power.  It
>tests and develops our inner spiritual strength
>by obliging us to face our fears.  The promise

>work for us anymore (or maybe never did) we
>experience inner personal power.
>
>
>
>Taurus provides us with the energy and

>patterns of self-indulgence and excessive

>wants us to align and shift our values, but not
>give up comfort and beauty, which are high on

>URANUS GOES DIRECT IN AQUARIUS

>Uranus adds a burst of revolutionary fever to

>inner change and liberation that we embraced
>during the retrograde period can now support us
>in making our contribution to the world.
>
>
>
>The Uranus factor can create intense emotional

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRCAL 11.07.03

just wanted to send a quick thanks to karina for all her work over the years 
putting out the SFR calendar.

when i first became interested in raving, i somehow found sfraves and i 
subscribed to the calendar (subscribing to the list came later).  and every 
week i'd get an email in my box with a list of parties with karina's 
signature at the bottom.

i think it took over a year for me to finally run into karina at a party!  
thanks again.  ;)

Subject: [sfraves] Don't waste your vote! (was Re: Nationalism and how to successfully oppose it)

One big reason there are few true libertarians who are mainstream and 
supported enough to win national office in the U.S. is that most 
Americans vote based on how they think *other people* are voting. For 
democracy to work properly, people have to vote for the candidate or 
party that most closely reflects their views. Otherwise you get leaders 
who don't stand for what the people really want, which is where we are 
now.

Too many people vote without integrity. Instead of asking, "Who has the 
best ideas?" voters ask, "Who can win?" They make mental calculations 
like "I can't stand Candidate A, but according to the news only 
Candidate B has a chance of beating him, so I better vote for Candidate 
B even though he's scary too."

People may feel clever for voting this way, but in fact it is dumb even 
if they don't give a shit about democracy. Why? Because one vote won't 
change the outcome of any state or national election. Even in local 
elections it's HIGHLY unusual. Case in point: When I ran for Supervisor 
last year, one of my opponents was always bringing up in debates how 
she previously lost the seat by "only" 712 votes. And nobody called her 
on it, because we all knew that even in a district representing less 
than 10% of San Francisco,  712 votes IS considered a close margin.
And that's just a local election!

Now think about the odds that your single vote will change the outcome 
of a state or national election! Even in the 2000 presidential race you 
would have had to convince several hundred people living in the right 
counties in Florida to switch their votes (just try getting 10 friends 
to vote the way you want!) in order to elect Gore over Bush. And that 
was a freak, once-in-a-lifetime election.

So is voting a waste of time? Not at all! When you vote, you add to 
someone's total. Voting for a candidate or party with a lower total 
makes your vote go proportionally farther. Kind of like how your local 
DJ/producer will notice it more if you buy one of his albums than 
Britney Spears will notice if you buy one of hers.

When it comes to elections, voting for the winner doesn't get you any 
brownie points. It's a secret ballot. And even if you know the guy 
you're voting for won't win in a million years, that's OK. Because it's 
not just about winning. It's about sending a message. And it's about 
beating expectations. If a candidate expected to get 1% gets 5%, that 
is news. The media and the public will have to take the candidate, and 
her party, more seriously.

Next time you vote, take a good look at the names on your ballot. 
Chances are good that the one you've never heard of before belongs to 
the person who would make the best officeholder. You didn't hear about 
them because they got little media coverage due to running with an 
alternative party, they weren't an incumbent, and/or they didn't have a 
truckload of money to spend getting the message out.

Forget what the media says about who will win or who the "serious" 
contenders are. It's a bunch of self-fulfilling bullshit designed to 
marginalize alternative voices. Find out who ALL the candidates are and 
vote with a clear conscience for the one you think is best.

Support the little guys. Vote Libertarian, or vote for another 
alternative party. Don't waste your vote on a Big Government 
Establishment politician!  Would you go to an overpriced massive put on 
by promoters with a bad rep just because you saw a lot of big fliers 
for the party and got six emails about it? Would you buy an insipid, 
flavor-of-the-week mainstream single just because there's a big display 
at Virgin Records and you saw the video on MTV? No? Then why on earth 
would you turn off your cultural radar when it comes to politics and 
vote for a mainstream Democrat or Republican?

I would disagree.
People are smart about their choices now.
In the recent Governor race, I met several people in my friend circle who
believed that Bustamante was going to support their cause (these friends
were Mexicans) and they decided to follow their leader. Others who heard
about Arnold groping the women, decided to move away from him. Yeah, it was
clear right from the beginning that Arnold was winning.

I wouldn't make such broad claims in this day and age.

Everybody should vote, educating the voters is the responsibility of the
candidate, many times they fail to do their part.

In a true democracy, making statements like  "support the small people"
somehow comes off "Corny" to me, coming from someone who wants people to
make their choices more liberally.

Agree?

Anil

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Don't waste your vote! (NRR)

After reading this message, I'm confused. Is it "smart" to vote for a 
politician of Mexican ancestry like Bustamante just because you happen 
to be Mexican instead of based on the issues? Being mistrustful of a 
candidate accused of groping large numbers of women may be smart. Of 
course it's also hypocritical if one says such things matter in the 
case of Arnold Schwarzenegger but not Bill Clinton -- or vice versa.

In any case, I wasn't trying to make a broad generalization that people 
are stupid. With a few notable exceptions (!), most of us are smart 
about some things and dumb about others. I'm just saying an honest look 
at election numbers proves that it's dumb to think that you're wasting 
your vote if you don't go for an establishment choice. This irrational 
"wasted vote syndrome" is the #1 factor keeping Libertarians and other 
alternative parties successfully marginalized.

It's the same phenomenon that causes Las Vegas slot machines and the 
California Lottery to be so profitable: Too many people haven't stopped 
to do the math, which makes them easy targets for manipulation. 
"Support the little guys" may sound corny, but doesn't it make more 
sense in a system run by an entrenched power elite than "Vote for a 
winner" or "It doesn't matter who you vote for, as long as you vote?"

Peace, love & liberty,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Don't waste your vote! (NRR)

It is sort of a conundrum isn't it.

Here's an analysis based on a recent attempt to take the GMAT(MBA entrance)
exam.

Read a short paragraph and answer the question that follows it:
You have 5 choices: a,b,c,d,e.

Here are 3 different possible ways to solve this problem:
1. If you have read the Peterson's guide you would skim over the paragraph,
use the "Process of Elimination" , cross down the usual suspects, and pick
one.
2. If you haven't read any such guide, you will spend a lot of time reading
the paragraph and pick a calculated choice, you will probably take a longer
time, miss the questions in the end and get a low overall score.
3. You find the question to be tough and you want to skip the question
completely. Such people might have at time made the best choice due to
negative scoring.
4. Randomly picks one. Treats it like a Las Vegas slot machine.

This is exactly what happens in an election.

People forget that its not an exam, its not a score, its believing in
something, someone.
Which is why some of them choose to follow what their friends & family are
doing. Because they believe their friends know best.

Ever met a Democratic family, I'm sure you have. They are all tied together
because one person made the decision, long time ago, for the rest of the
family. These people are so stoned they would even have the nerve to speak
up in a stern voice and claim, "WE ARE DEMOCRATS".

It's sad. It's true.

What we can and should do is educate people to step out of their box and
really read the paragraph, not be dismissal of any accusations they read in
the news and at the same time not be too influenced by such sensational
news.

Our leaders should do a better job of branching out and reaching the people.

Can you imagine Arnold - supporting the Mexicans and their cause. No. If he
doesn't do it, the mexicans are gonna keep hoping for a mexican leader. It's
not something you and I can change, we can only hope.

BTW : "Support the little guys" -- still sounds corny :)
And, it is always important to vote, and vote for the candidate that you
believe in.

Here's a game plan of what we can do: You, me and everyone else who wants
the system to work:
a.> Expand your circle of influence. Have more such open discussions in your
circle.
b.> Act as a data-center to provide non-biased and accurate political news.
c.> Act as a neutral party with the aim of providing honest, true, accurate
news.
d.> Perhaps we can somehow influence our leaders to do a better job too.

Subject: [sfraves] tenderloft busted by the pigs

the eavesdrop at tenderloft was a pretty decent scene tonight...                
everyone having a good time, no aggression, no problems.                        
                                                                                
but, like all good things in america, the pigs came and busted it up.           
'round 530a.  couldn't they at least wait 'till public transit turns on         
to destroy everyone's harmless fun?

there was an article in the washington post about this 
very issue - it's mathamatically proven the best thing to
do is vote for who you want vs. who you think will win.
i'll see if i can dig it out and type it up (if only to
kill this thread)

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

I a woke one morning to find a doughnut at my dinning table next to a "supe=
r
sized regular" glass of bovine utter secretion.
It looked to good to be true, was the thought which grazed my mind as I sat
down in my chair.

I picked up this perfect doughnut in my hand and raised it to my mouth
slowly, watching the morning sun shine through the window behind me, past m=

and slather across my doughnut with a golden light so bright that it forced
the on looking Gods to shield their eyes from the magnificent glory which
was the perfect doughnut which rested upon my nimble pathetic projectile
leprosy greeted hands.

Each sprinkle reflected the suns raises in it's own way.  I saw all of the
colors of the rainbow plus colors that I didn't even know existed until thi=

I stated with squinted eyes upon the doughnut bathed in so many colors and =
I
was in awe of how tranquil this glories master piece was which came forth
from a society that elected people based on popularity and created drones
who traded in their flags of hope to hind behind flags of fear.

I brought the doughnut up to my glossy drool covered lips and I thought to
myself "perhaps, just perhaps if a society can create a such a beautiful
creation than maybe there still is a chance for the future.

I bite into the doughnut...Clank!  I bite into it again and again each time
with the same Clank! Clank! Clank!  I turned the doughnut over in my glorie=

hand and read: =A9 2000 Accoutrements.

It isn't harmless.  :)

But there's the paradox!  It would have been harmless had five-oh let people
do their thing until MUNI was running again ... but nooooooo they gotta send
hella kids off to the wolves before they're ready.

TL's been busted before though, right?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tenderloft busted by the pigs

Was it Tenderloft (upstairs) or Infinite Kaos (downstairs) that you went to
a party at? Last I checked the TL kids upstairs were putting things on hold
for a while after downstairs let a foofoo promoter in that got the space
busted. That's also why you saw Tenderloft team up with Otherworld for the
big halloween party. The space is hot right now and throwing an event there
so soon is just asking for things to be indefinitely stopped.

the eavesdrop at tenderloft was a pretty decent scene tonight...
everyone having a good time, no aggression, no problems.

but, like all good things in america, the pigs came and busted it up.
'round 530a.  couldn't they at least wait 'till public transit turns on
to destroy everyone's harmless fun?

I just bought one haven't gotten to play on it yet. Just wondering if
anyone owns one what advice you have. I have heard enough audio samples
to know this unit will fit perfect into my setup. I have heard mixed
reviews so fill me in. 

 

Here are the Specs-

 


Overview
The SH-32 Synthesizer is a nod to Roland's past with a look toward the
future. This 4-part multitimbral synth uses new Wave Acceleration
Synthesis to deliver up to 32 voices of fat synth waves and entirely new
waveforms. There's also a full complement of knobs and sliders-plus
analog-style drums, DSP effects and a killer arpeggiator-giving
musicians desktop access to a range of stunning synth sounds at an
unbelievable low price. 

 


Features 

*	Powerful desktop synthesizer with massive real-time control 
*	New Wave Acceleration Synthesis creates a variety of synth
waves-67 total 
*	Includes standard synth waves plus new waveforms like Spectrum
and Noise 
*	Up to 32-note/4-part multitimbral operation 
*	2 main oscillators and 2 suboscillators with ultra-thick
Subsonic mode 
*	Pulse width modulation and oscillator "hard" sync capability 
*	insert and loop effects processors with 10 types of reverb/delay
and 35 multi-effects 
*	Programmable arpeggiator for creating synth lines or drum
patterns 
*	Patches using oscillator sync will be monophonic 


Details

Introducing Wave Acceleration Synthesis
The SH-32 uses new Wave Acceleration Synthesis to overcome the limited
polyphony and sounds of modeling-based synths. You get up to 32 voices,
plus 67 waveform variations from traditional analog waves to entirely
new waveforms like Spectrum and variable Noise. And when combined with
the new Subsonic mode found in the suboscillator section, you can create
everything from thick bass sounds to entirely new sounds not possible on
traditional synthesizers. There's even drum maps with samples taken from
the TR-808/909 Rhythm Composers. 

Easy Knob and Slider Control
If you prefer creating sounds to using factory presets, you'll love the
SH-32. Like Roland's instruments of the past, this tabletop synth is
covered with all the knobs, sliders and buttons you need for direct
parameter access. And because there are no hidden menus, the SH-32's
display consists of a simple, 3-digit LED. 

Programmable Arpeggiator
The SH-32's arpeggiator offers a variety of Preset templates, but can
also be fully programmed. When used in combination with the Chord Memory
function, you can produce complex arpeggios just like the ones heard in
modern techno styles including trance. And with so many front-panel
controls, programming is still ultra-intuitive. 

Effects Processing
Once you've created a sound, you can process it though the SH-32's two
independent effects processors. The Loop processor gives you 10
varieties of reverb/delay effects, while the Insert processor offers 35
multi-effects algorithms. These include everything from distortion,
compressor and pitch shifter to proprietary Groove effects like Slicer,
Lo-Fi and Isolator. 

An All-Purpose Performer
With its affordable price and compact size, the SH-32 is a great way to
add fat synth sounds to your music. Use it with your favorite sequencing
software or keyboard workstation, giving you bold new sounds. And when
paired up with a GrooveboxR, you've got a powerful desktop synth with
cool, retro-style sequencing. So whether for live use or in the studio,
the SH-32 will deliver the goods.

just to clear this up- a few rowdy people were
escorted outside, they caused a scene and the police
were called.  who, i might add, have been very
reasonable!  no need to blame them for doing their
jobs.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

just wondering ... is the downstairs space -- Infinite Kaos -- the one with 
the spiral staircase in the front?  People ... whatever place that is, it's a 
deathtrap. Can you imagine there being a fire, and everybody is stuck on the 
spiral staircase trying to get out? Is there any other way out of there? 
I've been to legal parties that were threatened over such public safety 
concerns as "the little wooden stairways don't have proper railings" (true story 
from Home Base) or "having to use porta potties presents a public health issue" 
(true story from 2nd & Jackson). So, driving parties underground into basement 
firetraps is some sort of safety improvement???  It's just too ironic to me. 
If I find out I've bought a ticket for a party at that basement place with 
the spiral staircase, i want my money back.

	I didn't realize the job of the police was to shut down a place of 
business when someone is ejected from that place of business for being 
rowdy. "Only doing their jobs," being "very reasonable" -- riiiiiight. 
I've seen a lot of people jaywalking lately... perhaps they ought to go 
enforce *that* "law."

If our government didn't make dancing -- or, for that matter, rave culture
as a whole -- illegal, we wouldn't be forced underground. If you want a
nice pretty perfect venue go to a massive. Undergrounds are always going
to be plagued by these kinds of problems because -- by being undergrounds
-- they seperate themselves from the big business profits of massives, and
must resort to less convenient, less 'perfect' venues.

And I think you're thinking of a different venue. :) The IK space is
pretty safe -- and pretty fucking cool, for that matter.

On a related note, I really think the foofoo party in IK really shouldn't
have happened. The kids I know that went to it, used to high-polish trance
parties, didn't appreciate the oldskoo feel of the space; had quite a few
points to bitch about, all of which seemed pretty inconsequential to me.
I've been to a lot of *dope* parties at that venue -- quite a few D&B, one
very notable one Psytrance -- and it's always been one of my favorites.
The layout, for whatever reason, gives me a proper warehouse vibe. It
almost makes me want to use the 'R' word. :b

There was a lot of hatin' goin around after that party got shut down, too,
IIRC. The people upstairs blamed the people downstairs, the people
downstairs blamed the people upstairs.. The 'inside scoop' among the
trance kids was some vague conspiracy theory that someone in the TL was
buying liqour for minors. I dunno.

Like I said... I don't think that party should have happened. The reason
the space is successful in the area it's in is b/c of the usually low key
crowd. Hopefully peeps will remember this incident next time someone tries
to throw a high-profile party downstairs. :b

Subject: Re: [sfraves] tenderloft busted by the pigs

they are being reasonable, trust me.  it's true that
nightclubs are arguably treated more harshly than a
lot of businesses in that they're often held
responsible for the actions of individual customers,
but... we're not a club.  they could easily confiscate
all of our property instead of simply shutting us
down.

can we let this thread die already please?!!

the tenderloft is not a legal, permitted place of business.  it's
actually someone's living room/kitchen, and they're kind enough to let
other people in there to throw parties.

	OK, let me rephrase that:  I didn't realize the job of the police was 
to kick people out of your living room/kitchen when someone else is 
being rowdy outside your house.

Fight the power!

Subject: [sfraves] Vegetarian Perspective

"Humans are funny birds.  We get so wrapped up in habits, comfort zones, and 
traditions that sometimes it takes a lot of strength and courage to step back 
and question who we are and what we do.

Thanksgiving is one such instance, sadly exemplified by the alternative name 
for the day: "Turkey Day."  Thanksgiving is meant to be a day when we 
celebrate the bounty of the harvest, pause in gratitude for the abundance most of us 
experience, and share what we have with others.  Most people don't stop to 
think about the near 300 million birds that are killed each year in the U.S., just 
to satisfy our appetites.  Of this number, 45 million are killed for 
Thanksgiving alone.

As someone who no animal flesh or secretions and teaches vegetarian cooking 
classes and vegetarian nutrition workshops, I have seen many people switch to 
plant-based eating and enjoy an abundance of delicious, nutritious food.  I 
also know that it takes a real shift in perception to shed the comfort zones of 
the past and create new ones.  Some people have a real fear that they will no 
longer have satisfying, filling meals -- especially on Thanksgiving.  I can say 
with confidence that they can put their fears to rest.

Our Thanksgiving feast every year is full of comfort foods galore: mashed 
potatoes with gravy, stuffing, mashed rutabagas, cranberry relish with pecans, 
stuffed squash, corn bread, Brussels sprouts, corn, peas, pumpkin pie with 
non-dairy whipped cream, and apple pie.  This was our meny last year, and I'm sure 
I've left something out.  Indeed, there is no dearth of food on our table.  
And for those who need that dose of familiarity, "tofu turkey" is always another 
option.

For those who have never met them, turkeys are magnificent animals, full of 
spunk and spark and affection.  I was amazed the first time I visited rescued 
turkeys at Farm Sanctuary, birds who had been abused, who had been de-toed and 
debeaked but who still displayed immense affection for humans.  One turkey 
climbed into my lap and cooed as she fell asleep in my arms, while I stroked her 
soft chest and beautiful feathers.

Sart a new tradition this year:  Try a turkey-free Thanksgiving.  It will be 
a Happy Turkey day indeed."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re: tenderloft busted by the pigs

Most laws dictate that if someone is on the sidewalk in front of your
house that is still property that is tied to you even though you cannot
block it off. If someone is in your front yard fighting no matter if you
are trying to get rid of them or not the police can be called. And if
there is enough evidence a party is going on that contains minors our
past curfew, dinking, or any of those sorts of things, then an officer
can consider the party a disturbance to the peace and contributing to
the delinquency of a minors which means shut down. It can happen in my
living room or yours no matter what the size. It is just a fact of life.
Police are scared of dance events and the culture that surrounds them.
They see groups of youth following elders who have a power to educate
and overthrow a corrupt government. The sad part is the dance community
for the most part has no political statement. Just some opinions. Peace

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

ok, talking about underground venues, by nature, has to be on the downlow and 
free of street-address description, so now i know that the 
Tenderloft/Infinite Kaos spot is NOT the one with the spiral staircase as the only way to get to 
the basement party area. I'm talking about the one that was used for 
Cybersexx, the post-Cyberfest after party. That place, I shoulda known when they said 
at Cyberfest, "After party, five bucks!" and then it was $7 at the door, and 
then seeing the narrow spiral staircase ... no way! 

anyhow i'm just trying to reinforce these point: 
* making formerly-legal party venues illegal/unable to get permits (e.g. 2nd 
& Jackson, HomeBase, Maritime Hall among others), in some misguided effort to 
increase the safety of partiers, is absurd because underground (esp. LITERALLY 
underground venues like this one, lol) parties may be held in locations that 
are much more unsafe. (Another example I gave last week, of breaking into 
condemned buildings and dancing amid clouds of asbestos(?))
*nobody should book a party at the place with the spiral staircase as the 
ONLY way to get in and out! Damn. Last I heard, drinking lots of water does not 
offer protection against incineration. Make sure you know how to get out if 
something happens. 

I know another underground spot in SF that DOES seem a lot safer, because 
there's a garage door that could be opened as another way out. 

Thank you.  End of safety lecture!  (Hey, can't help it, I've done a lot of 
emergency planning at work.)   I don't want to see a headline, "200 die in 
underground party disaster."

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for SF club manager contacts (SRR, SBSP)

I am looking into starting a newstylesound recordings biweekly club
night in SF.  Does anybody know anyone who is involved with booking
such things?  I will soon be going out and schmoozing with whomever I
can at some places around town, but my social skills..  They're
lacking, as many of you know.  ;)  If I can get some solid leads
w/email addys or phone numbers, that'd be awesome.

Something within the size range of the Top, Wish, 26Mix, etc, is what
I'm looking for. ~100 person cap.

Thanks much,

D-oh!nut.

I awoke one morning to find a doughnut at my dinning table next to a "super
sized regular" glass of bovine utter secretion.
It looked too good to be true, was the thought which grazed my mind as I sa=
t
down in my chair.

I picked up this perfect doughnut in my hand and raised it to my mouth
slowly, watching the morning sun shine through the window behind me, past m=
e
and slather across my doughnut with a golden light so bright that it forced
the on looking Gods to shield their eyes from the magnificent glory which
was the perfect doughnut which rested upon my nimble pathetic projectile
leprosy greeted hands.

Each sprinkle reflected the suns rays in it's own way.  I saw all of the
colors of the rainbow plus colors that I didn't even know existed until thi=
s
glorious morning shone upon my royally humble life.

I stared with squinted eyes upon the doughnut bathed in so many colors and =
I
was in awe of how tranquil this glorious master piece was which came forth
from a society that elected people based on popularity and created drones
who traded in their flags of hope to hind behind flags of fear.

I brought the doughnut up to my glossy drool covered lips and I thought to
myself "perhaps, just perhaps, if a society can create such a beautiful
creation, than maybe there still is a chance for the future.

I bit into the doughnut...Clank!  I bit into it again and again each time
with the same Clank! Clank! Clank!  I turned the doughnut over in my
glorious hand and read: =A9 2000 Accoutrements.

Groovebox crud.  Spend your money elsewhere, preferably Reaktor (which can
do all this and WAY more), or some real analog gear (which despite major
advances in modeling technology still sounds different).

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [NRR][Gear talk] The Roland SH-32

I am not looking for software and of course older analog gear can do the
same but I am not looking for analog I appreciate the feedback though.
This is not so much a Groovebox as an entry level synth. The reviews on
http://www.harmony-central.com have all led me to believe this is worth
the $200 I spent on it. I am not looking for a chunk of the past but
something different. Thank you for your advice it is noted and please I
hope you do not feel I am super defensive. I have taken time to research
what I have bought and am comfortable with it. I have been around
electronic music for 12 years and I felt the sounds I heard on the audio
samples would be right for glitchy random noise type tracks.

Hey, no worries.  I realized after I ctrl-x'd it to you that you'd already
bought it (so instead of giving advice I probably came off like a
butthole).  At $200 I'm sure it'll be worth it (if only as a sound
module), I'm just not a big Roland fan... last good things they did were
the 909 and the Space Echo...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [NRR][Gear talk] The Roland SH-32

I wouldn't mind tracking down a space echo some day. I have already
picked up the Quasimidi 309 as well so now this will be my second piece
to work with. I did not buy it for drum patterns at all as I love the
309's. I am looking to use it to add stabs of weird little crazy sounds.
With the metallic sounding notes it puts out I thought it would be good.
I have heard the pads are decent but the oscillator is so so. I am soon
going to pick up a decent Akai rackmount synth to add to the collection
it is amazing how quick my studio has materialized out of just a PC. LOL
Thanks man no hard feelings at all I know a lot of people do not love
Roland. Peace

Hey, no worries.  I realized after I ctrl-x'd it to you that you'd
already
bought it (so instead of giving advice I probably came off like a
butthole).  At $200 I'm sure it'll be worth it (if only as a sound
module), I'm just not a big Roland fan... last good things they did were
the 909 and the Space Echo...

Echo... echo...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GOS - WAS --> rave docu circa 93?

Best part of the night:

When I walked through the door, my pants started vibrating, and the bass
didn't let up anywhere in the venue.  Majesty Recordings booked a ridiculous
sound system for the party.

Huge spot, the South Chicago Expo, next to Photon (does anyone remember
Photon?  Coolest laser tag ever growing up).  After Photon shut down
nationwide, they started having parties at the two connected to each other.
I had no understanding of the talent I was experiencing at the time, but it
was definitely a jacking party!

Why do otherwise sensible people put up with such blatant witch-hunts?

     In defense to the story, I think the point of the sun being visible 
ABOVE THE POLLUTED COMPUTER CITY when neo & trinity shortly fly up & over, is 
that: #1 according to the first movie and the animatrix, the humans were the ones 
who shut off the machines source to the sun because the machines were becoming 
out of control.   #2 The machines then fought and won a war against the 
humans and probaly used all the dead carcuses for the power they did not get from 
the sun. #3 The machines then continued to recyle human embryos to maintain 
power and created a "matrix" to keep their brain busy. all except for those who 
escaped into Zion. #4 In the meantime whatever device the humans used to shut 
off access to the sun was never figured out by the computers... (who do not 
think in rational intuitive thought patterns mind you #5 In the end when neo 
reaches a peace agreement/proposition with the computer mainframe (who has now 
devolped it's own personality) the war ends, which would then allow the humans to 
fix their device on the sun in which in return the machines will refrain from 
killing them. Since Neo saves the computer world from the out of control 
virus Smith by sacrificing himself... he teaches the computers the meaning of life 
in which they return the favor by ending the war on humans. There is a scene 
where the sentinals suddenly stop attacking and wave & tilt their head at the 
humans, Morpheus then runs up to pet one of them. #6 As the movie blatently 
ponits out from time to time, the entire occourance was meant to be the way it 
was, an no other way, which means if at any time, something seemed highly 
improbably... it was meerly a coincidence. 
     In conclution I see the Matrix as an action movie platform to make 
spiritual and philisophical parallels with. So to say it has plot holes is like 
saying Mario Brothers has plot holes... like why does mario have a predermined 
amount of lives? and what exactly   is a "continue"? where does mario go when he 
falls down a hole? & why do you have to play the game over again every time 
you beat it? Matrix trilogy is a pioneer in it's genre it's not the first, just 
one of the definitive of it's kind, like Mario Brothers was to video games. 
It's very riske in some ways, boldly taking on contraversial ideas and bending 
them around vicously, and in other way the movie is too timid, in that it 
fails to communicate it's solidified meaning to most viewers who watch it. To say 
it has plot holes is like to tell Tony Hawk his landing was sloppy after he 
did a 920 degree spin in mid air off a halfpipe.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR - Police Auctions for Cars

Hola!

I'm curious if anyone has ever purchased a car at a police auction, or knows 
anything about it?  I've searched on police websites and not found anything 
about them, but have heard good things.  I have also found some websites that 
say pay us 40 bucks and we'll give you access to all the local auctions and 
whatnot.

Anyone have any input on this?

Much appreciated.

A message from Godskitchen U.K......

"Godskitchen is a place where expression and fantasy walk hand in hand...
Imagine the exhilaration when the music captivates your body and mind,
and your inhibitions are replaced with euphoria. Conjure up the sight of
colourful circus characters and sensational costumed performers parading
through thousands of ecstatic clubbers. Imagine striking lasers cutting
through a crowd of carnival antics and visual spectacles so stunning they
catch your breath...Imagine all this combined with the most uplifting tranc=
e
teasing you beat by beat through a rhythmic, celestial journey and you are
getting somewhere near to the power of a Godskitchen party.

The Godskitchen experience is coming the United States of America for the
inimitable "Sauza Tequila Godskitchen Get Lost Tour", and it=B9s going to be
bigger and better then anything the world has ever seen. THE UK's generatio=
n
defining club is heading for a repeat performance Stateside, and you can be
part of it. Having conquered their homeland, Ibiza and beyond the mighty
party kings are taking the spectacle across the U.S. on a non stop party
tour spreading the gospel of dance music to the masses. With a string of A
List DJs, mind blowing lightshows, eccentric performers, acrobats and
stunning visuals, this is clubbing for a new generation. It=B9s what America
has been waiting for."

If you're 18+, you can experience Godskitchen, in San Francisco, at the
Historic Avalon Ballroom, on Friday, November 21st. The Ballroom is located
at 1268 Sutter Street at Van Ness. Heralded as one of the most prestigious
venues in San Francisco, the Avalon Ballroom is an amazing place!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] GOS - WAS --> rave docu circa 93?

We had Q-Zar here. There were many parties at defunct q-zar spaces. I used
to play that thing when I was a sophmore back in 91. They had coupons to get
2 for 1 games and no limit on the coupons. That was a blast even if the
place was kinda lame. $7 for 30 minutes of running around shooting each
other to early trance. Good times...

Best part of the night:

When I walked through the door, my pants started vibrating, and the bass
didn't let up anywhere in the venue.  Majesty Recordings booked a ridiculous
sound system for the party.

Huge spot, the South Chicago Expo, next to Photon (does anyone remember
Photon?  Coolest laser tag ever growing up).  After Photon shut down
nationwide, they started having parties at the two connected to each other.
I had no understanding of the talent I was experiencing at the time, but it
was definitely a jacking party!

Witch hunt indeed-
Let me state 2 facts for you:
1) nature herself has determined that people sexually
mature at about the age of 13- why do you think that
might be?
2) the 18yo age-of-consent thing was IIRC brought in
to place by rich white land-owners upset about their
daughters' ways with "people of color"

I can understand you seeing a 35yo being with a 14yo
as "sick", just like I would see an 18yo being with a
60yo as "sick"- but IMO that's just a personal
preference thing.
The age disparity is more "strange" to me (versus the
absolute ages)
The *only* worthy angle here is that the average
13-14yo could likely be easily taken advantage of by
an older person, so I agree that it's probably best
for society to generally prohibit such things-
But the "14yo" in that first Yahoo IM transcript
clearly was not being taken advantage of in any sense.
She was driving the entire conversation towards the
meeting up for sex, coming back after his "you're too
young" objections multiple times.
Someone like that is *not* being taken advantage of or
manipulated by an older, more-emotionally-mature
person.
(Which, as I've already argued, is the only valid
cause for the age-of-consent stuff to begin with)

There is no real little girl; I think that is what you have mistaken.
These are people out to sting older men. Let me ask, do you feel it is
appropriate that a 20 year old fuck a 1 year old. Of course not but it
is the same age difference between a 15 year old and a 34 year old. It
is just not right in my eyes. I am a dad and get sickened by this. A
small child may be physically developed but mentally is another story.
Sorry this is my opinion. I am into crazy sexual practices but when it
comes to partners they get carded at the door.

I just don't see why anyone over 21 would wanna fuck someone that young 
anyway. Teenagers are stupid as shit for the most part. No matter how 
physically appealing someone might be, if they're dumb, sex just doesn't 
sound appealing. I couldn't have sex with someone I couldn't have a peer 
level conversation with....totally unappealing.

But a 37yo and an 18yo is just fine by you?
Since it's legal?
But 36 and 17 is not?

It's just something that's impossible to have a law
around.  Today she's 17, tomorrow she's 18- one day
I'm bad, the next day I'm not?
Come on man- that 16yo might be at the level of the
average 20yo, while that 20yo might be as emotionally
fragile as a lilly.  That's what the law should be
built around, but because it's different for every
person it's an impossible thing to generalize.
In any case, I think baiting guys with 15year-olds who
clearly are not behaving like 15year-olds, and are
clearly not being taken advantage of by their youth,
is just- a witchhunt.
Enjoy, we're all going to jail:

Subject: [sfraves] Re: NRR - Police Auctions for Cars

	I'd encourage everyone not to participate in police auctions, just for 
moral reasons. Buying cars from the police rewards them for stealing 
peoples' property. The police regularly steal vehicles from people who 
did nothing wrong. In Oakland, they'll take the cars of people merely 
suspected of soliciting prostitution, or who are the victim of a sting 
operation. They can also seize your car for mere possession of a small 
amount of drugs. It's not unknown for them to plant stuff on someone in 
order to arrest or rob the person. Police and even judges often get a 
cut of the proceeds from what is siezed, so the system acts as a direct 
incentive to corruption and to ruling against people getting their 
property back. If you don't believe it, do a web search on "civil asset 
forfeiture." Buying a car at one of these auctions is like buying 
jewelry from that shifty guy whispering to you on the street.

It is scary how the seizure laws are written out. They allow basically
for the police to destroy your life with the drop of a hat. Peace

Subject: [sfraves] Re: [NRR] Go pick another wagon to jump on

	I know as a father you feel all kinds of protective urges now. All 
that biological territoriality and nurturing instinct kicks in. But you 
should realize that a lot of people get railroaded by the system, and 
then are stuck with the stigma of being "sex offenders." That person 
you call up to lash out at with your hatred could be one of them.

	A good friend of mine was. After over 100 consensual encounters with a 
poorly-chosen partner who was "underage" and had serious issues about 
his sexual identity, this individual suddenly decided to tell his 
parents that he'd been coerced and manipulated by my friend all along. 
Who do you think they believed? Not that it probably would have 
mattered much -- according to the law, just by being who he is, a 
person who happens to be attracted to younger guys, my friend is seen 
as a monster to be punished and reviled by society. This would be true 
if he'd never done anything more than looked at photos -- and of course 
having "child pornography" was one of the things they charged him with 
-- my friend is some kind of monster for being attracted to people 
younger than himself. He is a very sensitive person who would never 
hurt or coerce anybody, and now he is serving ten years with all kinds 
of low-life homophobes and gang-banging thug types. And that's just the 
people on the other side of the bars.

	I don't know exactly what concept is in your head when you say 
"pedophile," but the idea that until a person has their 18th birthday 
they are a child and anybody older who might engage in sexual relations 
with them is some kind of monster, and then on that day they undergo 
some magical transformation and become an adult and everything's cool, 
is one of the most illogical, fucked-up pieces of 
government-money-stolen-from-the-people-reinforced bullshit ever.

	Looking back now, I wish *I* had been consensually "molested" when I 
was a teenager. Having an older person there for me would have made 
those years a little more bearable. So don't you tell me that a teen 
can never make that decision. I know better.

Fight the power!

Subject: [sfraves] RE: [NRR] Go pick another wagon to jump on

You know I must say thank you for asking the question that no one has
yet. My belief in what a sexual predator is. My belief is that a
predator is just that someone who preys upon our youth. I do not agree
with some 30 year old man trying to convince a 14 year old to meet them
some where for an encounter. That to me just says something is wrong. I
have known plenty of men and women between the ages of 16 and 18 that
have dated people in their 20's. If you are old enough to be someone's
father or mother you should not be thinking of a person sexually but
helping educate them on life lessons. A child will one day pass laws and
regulations which will dictate my life and I would prefer they have a
stable mind in doing so. That is just my opinion. I know it probably
contradicts all the shit earlier today but who said I wasn't just
fucking with the people who did not know how to discuss a topic in a
normal manner. Peace and thank you for writing a well thought out
response

	I know as a father you feel all kinds of protective urges now.
All 
that biological territoriality and nurturing instinct kicks in. But you 
should realize that a lot of people get railroaded by the system, and 
then are stuck with the stigma of being "sex offenders." That person 
you call up to lash out at with your hatred could be one of them.

	A good friend of mine was. After over 100 consensual encounters
with a 
poorly-chosen partner who was "underage" and had serious issues about 
his sexual identity, this individual suddenly decided to tell his 
parents that he'd been coerced and manipulated by my friend all along. 
Who do you think they believed? Not that it probably would have 
mattered much -- according to the law, just by being who he is, a 
person who happens to be attracted to younger guys, my friend is seen 
as a monster to be punished and reviled by society. This would be true 
if he'd never done anything more than looked at photos -- and of course 
having "child pornography" was one of the things they charged him with 
-- my friend is some kind of monster for being attracted to people 
younger than himself. He is a very sensitive person who would never 
hurt or coerce anybody, and now he is serving ten years with all kinds 
of low-life homophobes and gang-banging thug types. And that's just the 
people on the other side of the bars.

	I don't know exactly what concept is in your head when you say 
"pedophile," but the idea that until a person has their 18th birthday 
they are a child and anybody older who might engage in sexual relations 
with them is some kind of monster, and then on that day they undergo 
some magical transformation and become an adult and everything's cool, 
is one of the most illogical, fucked-up pieces of 
government-money-stolen-from-the-people-reinforced bullshit ever.

	Looking back now, I wish *I* had been consensually "molested"
when I 
was a teenager. Having an older person there for me would have made 
those years a little more bearable. So don't you tell me that a teen 
can never make that decision. I know better.

Fight the power!

Boycotting police auctions isn't helping the problem, you're only 
eliminating another of your possible choices.  Not all police seizures are 
unjust, surprise, there really are people out there doing bad things, and 
they get caught.  FURTHERMORE, the question was about buying a used POLICE 
CAR, which would not have been seized to begin with.

You don't need to pay anyone for info about auctions.  use google.  it's free.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: NRR - Police Auctions for Cars

	I don't believe the questioner stated that the purpose was to buy a 
POLICE CAR. I'm not even sure if such vehicles are sold to the public. 
But to address your point, yes, I'm sure there are some cars being sold 
at police auctions on the up-and-up. Abandoned vehicles, old undercover 
cars, that kind of thing.

	Problem is, the cops aren't going to tell you which cars they 
legitimately own and which ones they just stole from people. So if you 
buy a vehicle at a police auction, there's a good chance you're helping 
them make a nice profit on stolen goods and giving them more incentive 
to keep stealing.

	Think how you'd feel if it was someone else buying your car that was 
jacked from you on the cheap.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [SRR] [Gear Talk] Best DJ Mixer?

Pioneer has a digital output on its DJM3000, Im sure it makes for a great
recording tool. But Ive seen two other mixers with not only a few digital
outs, but a few digital inputs as well:

Tascam X9:
http://www.tascam.com/product_info.php?pid=334&nav=computer_recording

Denon DN-X800:
http://www.usa.denon.com/catalog/photo.asp?s=pro&p=DN%2DX800&f=DNX800%2Ejpg&

My main concern remains on quality tho, Im currently leaning towards the
Allen and Heath or Rane direction...the Rane MP-44 looks esp tasty.

Depends what you are looking for...!? Does that include best sound? or
easiest to mix on?

I think the djm-600 is the EASIEST to mix on, but it sounds like crap and
too many people red line it when they play on it.
The Rane Rotary SOUNDS the best.
The Allen and Heath Xone series is a mixture of both.

Not sure about the digital in/outs.  anyone?
My 2 cents,.

My advice - do NOT get a Tascam x9.  Talk about a piece of &*#$!!!!

The noise on that is so bad that by just hitting the power button, you
get EMF so loud that you can actually run effects on them!  That's BAD!

And the plastic faders are just TOO cheap!

I bought one and kept if for a whole week before trading it in...for a
Rane Empath.  That too falls very short of the "perfect" mixer - but at
least it sounds great. 

I wanted the Tascam to work out though - it had lots of stuff to play
with - but it just wasn't a good mixer by any means...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [SRR] [Gear Talk] Best DJ Mixer?

  In my opinion the best quality mixer in sound and
build is between three different mixers and all of
them are outstanding so it would be hard to choose
between them but here goes:

 1. Rane MP 44  4 Chanel with 3 band eq  (my personal
favorite and also what I own)

 2. Allen & Heath Xone 62 4 channel with 4 band eq

 3. Rane MP 2016 Rotary mixer with XP 2016 processor
(I want one so bad! They totally rock.)

 All three of these mixers are awsome and you couldn't
go wrong with any one of them.

 What ever you do stay away from the Pioneer mixers if
sound quality is your main focus. The Rane and Allen &
Haeths blow Pioneer out of the water in sound.

Depends on whether you picked the underage guy up at an unlicensed venue
which happens to be someone's living room.

Only if it's an old police car and he's handcuffed to the door.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [SRR] [Gear Talk] Best DJ Mixer?

I was wondering, do DJs usually upgrade mixers like shoes, or do you find 
what you like and stick with it?  Is there really an all around BEST mixer 
like technics?  Right now I have the Vextax PMC 05 limited model, I think DJ 
qbert had his hands involved in the design.  I am happy with the mixer for 
now, I kind of wish there was a mid knob, but I'm such a noob, I am having a 
blast with my tables any damn way.

Also, do genres really have something to do with what mixer you choose?

thanks all

Oh nelly, yes! Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that a djs mixing
style has something to do with the mixer they choose.

Rane 2016 and Allen & Heath are some of the best sounding mixers I've
ever heard, but they're geared to djs that lean to a long, smooth mixing
style.   I'd love to own one of those for the sound alone, but they're
just not fit for my various style of mixing.  I mean for the smooth,
more proggy mixes, their great, but when I dip into the harder stuff
that begs to be chopped up and sampled to hell, then my stle of mixing
gets aggressive and these mixers can't handle aggressive mixer handling.
It's just too clumsy to do a quick volume raise with the 2016 knob lines
and the Allen & Heaths always have a sort of delay when you quickly cut
with the crossfader. It sounds shitty.

Scratch DJs I know go for Vestax and some of the newer Ranes.

Proggy heads love Allen & Heath.

The masses seem to go for Pioneer, but I won't comment on them except to
say they have a layout that I'm confortable with, but I break a lot of
'em.

That's my .16 cents...

It sucks that I'm making my UK trip right after this big ol' anti-Dubya 
shindig happens in London.  I have to say, there'd have been some 
devilish fun and going out and protesting my own president (I use that 
term loosely) in another country.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [SRR] [Gear Talk] Best DJ Mixer?

My favorite mixer that's got an "all around" feel to it has got to be the 
Vestax PMC250. It's a Vestax, so it's a smidge more geared towards scratch 
dj's, but it's got these HUGE rotary eq's that give it the feel of a house 
dj's mixer. It's got kill faders for each EQ, so you can either slowly 
eliminate that channel of EQ, or totally kill it all at once. Plus it's got 
responsive up/cross faders for cutting. I spin house, breaks, prog., techno 
& D&B, so a mixer like this kind of serves all my general needs (for long 
mixes or quick cuts). Now if I could only save the $$ to get one (not like 
they're expensive at $350 brand new), I'll be set. Sucks being a poor 
mofo...anyone have one they wanna sell me cheap???? LOL!

I had my last mixer and loved it - a basic Vestax 15Mk2 (guess its now
the pmc150 or something).  The only gribe I had about the mixer was 1)
crossfaders were a BITCH to find (they may have settled that issue by
now) and 2) it was used at Teknique when it was around and having RCA
line ins only and a weak headphone output made it not an ideal mixer to
use out of the studio. But for in the studio, I don't mind Vestax.

Hi Jblaze.

I can see what you're getting at, in that everything has a different
meaning, based on perception and perspective.  But, a plot, is more fact
than interpretation.  It is the fundamental basis of the story.  Yes, you
can interpret things based on the plot, but contradictions within it only
lessen how believable the story is.

To use your example, it would be like Tony Hawk doing a 900 off a ramp,
then someone finding out that he didn't have any wheels on his skateboard.
This makes his trick not only unbelievable, but impossible.  So how did he
do it?  The same reasoning applies here.

Now, I do admit that some of my hostility is simply due to an overall
dissatisfaction with the second two movies.  The animatrix shorts were
great though, largely due to simple, cohesive mini-plots.

Right.  So now the world is covered with black clouds at what 10,000 feet?
Great.  We assume satellites are still operational, yes?  Why would the
ai/machines not just move off planet?

So, you're saying the inprisonment and subsequent farming of the humans
was more of a punishment than effective way to generate energy?

Still...  human bodies do not produce more energy than they consume.
In accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.  Overall, this entire
effort is wasted energy.

Right, nor did they figure out that they could fly above the clouds, or
exist in space, or find a new planet to live on, all of which would have
taken less energy overall than building this flawed system of energy
farming.

Obviously these "AI" aren't very intelligent.

Fix the device?  I'm not positive on this, but wasn't it made clear that
this was a long term if not permanent solution?  Didn't morpheus explain
to neo that the human race suffered from this choice just as much if not
more than the machines?

Just because it was meant to be, does not mean it makes logical sense.

I mean, they could have gotten around all of this by going for more of a
naked lunch style confusion-plot, which I think would have pleased the
fans more, and done justice to the story much more than the
ultra-hollywood quasi religious love story.

Of course this is all just my opinion, which matters very little if at
all.

I dunno...  The incessant stumping for the libertarian party is a bit 
tedious.  (Not that the LP doesn't have some very good ideas, but it 
also has a couple of very important (IMHO) fundamental flaws that keep 
me from supporting it.)

But he's spot on, every time, on not supporting those jackbooted thugs. 
  And it's a damn refreshing to see that there *ARE* others here whose 
attitudes towards the pigs are not: "bend over and take, without so 
much as a complaint, anything and everything they dish out.".

D-oh!nut.

I awoke one morning to find a doughnut at my dinning table next to a "super

It looked too good to be true, was the thought which grazed my mind as I sa=

down in my chair.

I picked up this perfect doughnut in my hand and raised it to my mouth
slowly, watching the morning sunshine through the window behind me, past me
and slather across my doughnut with a golden light, so bright that it force=

s
the perfect doughnut that rested upon my nimble pathetic projectile leprosy
greeted hands.

Each sprinkle reflected the suns rays in it's own way.  I saw all of the
colors of the rainbow plus colors.  I didn't even know existed until this
glorious morning shone upon my royally humble life.

I stared with squinted eyes upon the doughnut bathed in so many colors and =
I
was in awe of how tranquil this glorious master piece was which came forth
from a society that elected people based on popularity and created drones
who traded in their flags of hope to hide behind flags of fear.

I brought the doughnut up to my glossy drool covered lips.  I thought to
myself "perhaps, just perhaps, if a society can create such a beautiful
creation, than maybe there still is a chance for the future.

I bit into the doughnut...Clank!  I bit into it again and again each time
with the same Clank! Clank! Clank!  I turned the doughnut over in my
glorious hand and read: =A9 2000 Accoutrements.

Subject: [sfraves] SFR Calendar Archives


Dear SFR Community,

I'm building an archive of all SFR calendars, from 1992 on. If anyone here
has an archive of emailed SFR calendars from 1992-1998, please forward me
the copy of the Calendar in Email (with headers if possible). I thank you
so kindly for your support and any help you may offer in helping me build
this archive.

As part of this ongoing process, I'm reviewing the SFR archives for any
calendar information that might be present for extraction and addition to
the SFR calendar archive.

Currently there *is* a calendar archive for years 1998-2003 @
http://www.sfraves.org/archives/sfrcal/

If you find anything missing and have a copy of it, please forward it to
me as well - my address is karina@hyperreal.org

Thank  you!

Much love,

Karina

I think she's suing over its release because it shows she's pretty dull

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [SRR] [Gear Talk] Best DJ Mixer?

You should see Misstress Barbara on the 2016!!! Like whoa!!! Somehow she 
takes all that, throws it out the window, and makes it work... Better than 
she does on an MP44 or DJM 600...

I've tried it like that once. It ended up being ME that was too clumsy to 
negotiate the rotary input dials like that. But I bet with more 
opportunities to try.........

I'm kind of partial to the cellphone ringtone and the fact that she, the

herself off of me to tend the cellphone.  Jackass!!!

I dunno, women who are built like 12 year old boys just don't appeal to me. 
Plus, as skinny as she is, she has a jiggly ass. That is FOUL. On top of all 
that, she looks every bit the spoiled bitch she is. Shallow, vapid, 
materialistic, and snotty....none of these things are attractive.

Gimmee a Kristin Kreuk (Lana Lang on Smallville) type gal any day of the 
week over a Paris Hilton.

If you want the mid nob, upgrade to the 07Pro, same basic design as the 05
with some additional mixing DJ friendly features.  My favorite mixer by far
to play on, unfortunately not very well set up for club use.  Mixer
preference comes down to the style that you mix in, which can be influenced
by the genres you play, but is not an absolute.  I've yet to find a mixer
that fully combines all the features I like.  My ultimate mixer would be a
mix of the top of the line Allen + Heath, Vestax, and Pioneer models, taking
all the good stuff from each and weeding out the flaws, and in my mind each
mixer has at least one fatal flaw.

links to sites that are displaying it.  Once again, for anyone who doesn't 
know how to get the video, go to Gorilla Mask and they have links where you 
can DL it.  PS, it's not that good... PPS, I used to work for Hilton Corp; 
HA HA HA FUCKERS... sorry, I had to get that out.

Love and Sea Biscuits,
Joe.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr yet ---> BUt I got a new Job!!! weeeeeeeeeeeee

OK... I know this is the 3rd time this year I posted that I got a new job on here... but I got this on my own w/o any help from my beloved SFR Fam!!

Let me also state that when I did that gig @ Cinderblock... I was only a temp & temps can be let go @ any time (even if it was just after 1 day I was let go because I couldn't fold 60 clothes or tag 150 clothes in a minute & 1/2). So I'm sorry Philip 4 that!  Im also sorry to Ed Colmar for not paying more attention to what I was suppose 2 B doing when I worked for the month @ Green Copy & well... I'm just not a making copies all day kinda guy I guess...

But yeah, the new company I work for is called "WMN Talent" & basically what the company does is promote people who want to be (well... picked rather) 2 B promoted by my company to become a model, popularize your music career, or get into the acting industry!  My job is to scout the talent out there & refer people to my boss who will then evaluate you & well... lada blah blah blah... I'm gonna be working as a talent scout basically & I will be holding lil' "cattle calls" to meet people (esp U cats on SFR)... so expect me 2 post on here where I'll be holding these things on here & stuff, ya know... 

I mean... I"m gonna working 40 hours a week scouting people all day long & stuff & 4 like the 1st 3 months it's gonna be like a contracting thing then after 90 days, I get option to become a full employee of the company w/ the whole med & den benifits goodies I totally need...

I know this is a long shot 'cause my paycheck until that point relies on alot of things & it is kinda unstable 4 the 1st 90 days... but I think I can make this happen!  I mean... the whole process of interviewing was soooo nerve racking 'cause there were cuts w/in the whole like 4 hr process & a final call here @ home!  I feel so lucky that I made all the cuts & when I got the call... I was flyin' man!  I did talk 2 Ryan (Mr. Innocentchild) 'cause I did need a mondo reality check so I wouldn't be all fluffy from excitement & well... Hello2Day, SEriously, Ryan always knows how 2 set me strait & get perspective on situtations! LoL  Thanks Ry... Love Ya Dude 4 that chat we had! =)

So yeah... I start training 2morrow @ 9:30 (or 2day depending on when U read this) & yeah... I"m like mondo buggin'!!!

OK... jus'thought I'd share =)



Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Catharsis on An Epiphany Of Sound - 11/13/03

Coming up in under 9 hours, I'll be hosting Catharsis on An Epiphany Of
Sound.  I have a feeling that he's got a few tricks up his sleeve, as he
prefers to cater to those outside the herd.

Tune in, 90.1 FM or http://kzsulive.stanford.edu
9a-Noon Pacific time, Thur. 11/13/03

Peace.

I'm going to throw in some powernoise and electro-industrial that inspired

will be available on the cheap before it hits distro.

Tomorrow... err... today 9am to noon I'll be DJing on Epiphany of Sound,

Right, nor did they figure out that they could fly above the clouds, or
exist in space, or find a new planet to live on, all of which would have
taken less energy overall than building this flawed system of energy
farming.

"Still... human bodies do not produce more energy than they consume."

That does not mean it isn't the most efficient source of energy for the
machines,
based on the fact that no sunlight is reaching the surface.  As to
outterspace and
all that, who knows.  I'm sure that in the small amount of time that has
past for the
A.I. they'd be in the boat we're in; space is big, Earth has a lot of
gravity, etc.

Watch the Aminmatrix to answer your questions on why the A.I. turned on
humanity.

<< 3) if you get the rash again, use hydrocortisone to get rid of

People, don't ever use hydrocortisone for a rash that may be a fungal 
infection (ie. moist neck or athlete's foot), it will only cover up the inflamation 
while the infection gets worse. Better to use Benadryl (diphenhydramine) cream 
for an itchy rash, and check with a dermatologist.  Of course elimanating 
contact with the offending substance is always a must when dealing with an allergy 
or inflamation.  Try sewing or gluing another piece of fabric over/around the 
desired area.  If ever in doubt contact your doctor or dermatologist.  People 
remember, if you ever have a chronic or acute problem (recurring or sustained 
or intense) you don't want to deal with it for the rest of your life so 
please consult a professional problem solver in that area of expertise.

Hi...

Now I realize that we are getting to the point of overanalysis on
something that is supposed to be mythical, with christian overtones...
But...  These things just bother me, and since it is the premise of the
entire story, it makes the entire thing seem absurd.

On Thu, 13 Nov 2003 JBlaze112@aol.com wrote:

The human body does not create this energy out of nothing.  If the body
was 100% efficient (which is near impossible) there would be 0 energy
(heat) escaping.

Here are the laws of thermodynamics.
From: http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookEner1.html

--

First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can be changed from one form to
another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The total amount of energy
and matter in the Universe remains constant, merely changing from one form
to another. The First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation) states that
energy is always conserved, it cannot be created or destroyed. In essence,
energy can be converted from one form into another.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that "in all energy exchanges, if
no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state
will always be less than that of the initial state." This is also commonly
referred to as entropy. A watchspring-driven watch will run until the
potential energy in the spring is converted, and not again until energy is
reapplied to the spring to rewind it. A car that has run out of gas will
not run again until you walk 10 miles to a gas station and refuel the car.
Once the potential energy locked in carbohydrates is converted into
kinetic energy (energy in use or motion), the organism will get no more
until energy is input again. In the process of energy transfer, some
energy will dissipate as heat. Entropy is a measure of disorder: cells are
NOT disordered and so have low entropy. The flow of energy maintains order
and life. Entropy wins when organisms cease to take in energy and die.

--

So, even if these "human batteries" were doing nothing more than making
heat (which is not the case) they still would not be 'generating'
anything.  Overall, even with a loop of feeding dead humans to living
ones, you would never reach a point where the energy created was more
than what was used.

And again...  They /could/ have gotten around this by making a more
intricate and confusing plot...  layers upon layers of matrixes where the
rules are different, and laws (like thermodynamics) could be broken,
because it is not actually reality.

wow... that's a very intelligent post. I agree 100%. After all, those

Seriously - there is nothing as annoyingly persistent as fungal
infestations.  Athlete's foot being just one example.  Take care of it
sooner, rather than later.

Sao Paolo, Brazil: "Electronic Music For All" Draws 127,000

The Association of Friends of Electronic Music (AME) held "City Parade - 
Electronic Music for All" on October 26, 2003, drawing 127,000 people to 
the streets of Sao Paulo.  AME was established to bring public 
awareness  to electronic music culture, and to demonstrate the values of 
the scene. In addition to the street parade, AME will work to improve the 
electronic music industry, promote harm reduction to confront drug use, and 
organize people in the scene to work with community charities.  They also 
plan to lobby Brazil's government as part of the National Campaign Against 
Excessive Taxation of Imported Vinyl.

Their website is in Portuguese, however, an English version of their 
manifesto is available:

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"It is not the same to talk of the bulls as to be in the bullring."
-Spanish Proverb

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

hello, this is your on-line crystal ball with your reading for the day..."once upon a time, there was an ogar man who lived at the top of a rickety wooden rack way, way up in the sky...one day, he brought up an impartial party to take a look at the view, and he told the person that the reason he lives so high is that if he jumps from the top, surely he'd crash to his death...just for emergency purposes of course..that night, the two slept next to one another, and after what had been years of wear and tear, the balcony cracked and broke from beneath the ogar, and as he fell, he knew that when he hit the ground that he'd fallen to his end, for sure....always plan ahead..."...more later...:)

They don't make RR t-shirts in scrawy white-guy sizes!  I'd be bout it if 
y'all made something less than xxL and xL though.  The baby-t really isn't 
my style either, lol.  When you guys put out a shirt for a guy who looks 
like he just got out of a third world prison, I'll be the first in line to 
swoop one up.  Until then, I'll just keep droppin the hard beats and shakin' 
the 2.5 square centimeter booty that I got.
Peace.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, first of all I want to say I'm planning to go to the Moksha Tribe party, 
Harvest, on Saturday. I've heard so many good things about their party and 
have yet to go to one, so it's about time. Also, the Shaolin crew are good people 
and they're putting on Power Puff Girls in Sacramento, which should be a fun 
party. 

I was surprised to find that Ferry Corsten and DJ Rap will also be in town, 
for a national tour sponsored by Sony Playstation 2. I don't know what a 
Playstation gig is like compared to another kind of performance. You know that Rap 
will be coming around again, and Ferry will too (eventually), but anyhow if you 
want to check them out, info is at 
http://www.us.playstation.com/Events.aspx?id=28  

Everyone have a good weekend!
Jonnyr

If your from the Bay you know about Qbert, founding member of the seminal
turntable group the Invisibl Skratch Piklz and considered by many to be the
most skilled dj around, period. The Picaso of turntablism, Q put to final rest
the critics who refused to accept the turntable as a musical instrument. He won
so many DMC battles, he was banned from compitition, and was instrumental in
the development of the ITF. Alongside Dug 1, Syd Garon and Eric Henry, Qbert
composed the first , and only, full lenth animated film based entirly around a
scratch music album. Join us for this rare appearance.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"It is not the same to talk of the bulls as to be in the bullring."
-Spanish Proverb

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

It's only absurd because of it's brave and original attempt at relating it's
story to real life and real time, it makes us think about reality, science,
religion, myth and technology and politics, thus allowing us to anylize it
by
real life rules and science enevitibly to prove it wrong one way or another.
The
point is that it makes this attempt, and does it boldly, it makes you think
about how things work.
You cannot say the same for highly acclaimed movies like Lord of the Rings
or
Star Wars because they are complete fantasy and you can't hold them to real
life rules and science.

----Sure I can.  If you think Matrix does as you say and the above two do
not,
then you are not properly watching these two movies.  Matrix hits closer to
home
in terms of the vehicle the story is told in (modern life, computers, etc.),
but that
doesn't mean it hits closer to the mark.    You really should take a look at
Joseph Campbells "The Power of Myth", just for a small eye opener.  Lucas
would
tell you himself that Star Wars is based quite heavily on Campbell's work
"The Hero
With a Thousand Faces.", a work that is exactly about stories (myths) that
speak
to us on a very human and universal level, no matter the point in time that
you live in.

They only have subtle hints of comparason to our real
life today and usually it's just the struggle of good & evil, love and blah
blah blah, to me I think fantasy writers hide behind safety nets to get
their
subtle, less arguable, less contraversial messeges across. Where as Matrix
boldly
and blatently communicates messages that pertain to all of our daily life.


-----I could just as easily say Matrix is a simple story about love (Neo and
Trinity) and
good (humanity) and evil (machines / technology) and blah blah blah, but I
wont.  You're
correct that Matrix does try and be more than a simple story, but the
previously mentioned
are also more than you imply.  There is  a dirge (as always) of fantasy
writters that do
put out fluff, but there are great ones as well; most of which you'll have
to read their books
though.

Once my family and I were watching Beauty and the Beast.  You know the part where Belle runs out of the castle and almost gets killed my wolves and then she blames it on the Beast for being angry of her going to the west wing?  Well, we stopped the movie and started analyzing it and argued over who's fault it was.  Then we realized, it was a Disney movie and we were just being stupid over trying to make sense of it.
 
Just my two cents.

Subject: [sfraves]Harvest Review!  

Well, my saturday started around 5pm when I woke up, so I was especially 
rested for the evening.  I ate a good meal, smoked some good smoke, slammed 
a redbull, picked up my homeboy and we was off to the map point for harvest. 
  It was interesting, cuz I had been to that map point before, except it led 
me to some party that was in this massive house behind grand lake theatre, 
but thats another story.

So we arrive to the spot and it was conviniently located a block away from a 
liquior store, so I picked up some hennessy and coke.  Walking up to the 
venue, it looked huge!  I was worried the door security would have a problem 
with my hennessy, but it was all good!  We walked down this looooong hallway 
until we heard the thumping subs, arriving at the front desk I saw OSBY!  
OMG HELLO 2DAY!!  He showed me his new piercing and his battle scars from 
surgery and introduced me to everyone else that was up front, I don't 
remember everyone's names except for Delia, she is tha bomb!  Everytime I 
saw her she had a fat grin on her face.  Osby was tellin everyone that I was 
a tight dancer, which made me blush and kinda worry, cuz I am by no means 
off tha hook...  I would like to say I have good rhythm and am able to get 
down for hours on end, but if you see me, I'll let yall be the judge!

So, I gave the Ferona Room a quick once over, the layout was awesome!  but I 
am more of a DnB/Breaks cat, so my review will be soley about the Kornwolf 
room.  We walked into the Kornwolf room and the first thing we saw werre 
like 16 subs stacked on top of eachother, I was lke...YEAH!!  The walls were 
lined with comfy couches and there was a huge spread of fruit and other 
delectable goodies.  Next to the Ferona room was the smoking area, that was 
a great idea, I never realized how smoky it got when peope just spark up 
everywhere, and the smoking room was close enough that it wasnt a pain to 
smoke when you needed to.  So when we arrived Phaedrus was nearing towards 
the end of his set, I was totally feelin his music though, especially the 
fact that he dropped this Kemal & Rob Data cut!  I have never heard them 
through subs that rowdy before, so it was AWESOME!  I definitley had to get 
down and dance a bit, but I started to slow down right when HAK got on, cuz 
I had to sip on my hennessy and get my buzz on, feel me?

So Hak was spinnin a propa set, I sat right next to the subs so  I could 
feel the fullest affection.  I had to get up a couple times to dance just 
cuz I was feelin the dnb down to my bones...yummy.  So, we had killed the 
hennessy and that just happened to be when Jauncy started his set.  I was 
totally feelin his breaks!  Damn..I wanna get some of the shit he was 
spinnin on wax!  It was the type of music that just made you wanna shake 
your ass or hold on tight to someone sexy!  GREAT SET!  I loved it!  Jauncy 
was totally gettn the room heated to, so good job!

I pretty much was a couch potato for Calamity Jane's set, but I did get my 
groove on a couple times.  And I remember dancing next to this female that 
was totally feelin the music, our hands bumped into eachother, and I regret 
now not dancing with her more, cuz I liked her rhythm, but sadly, a pint of 
hennessy isnt enough to get me riled up.  If there was more alcohol in me, I 
would have been dancin a whole lot more, but I loved them breaks, this party 
really made me want to go out and purchase some wax!

I also got to FINALLY meet Apollo!  He was really busy, trying to handle 
shit which is totally understandable, and I dont think he heard me thank him 
for throwing Harvest, so Apollo!  Thank you so much, it was great to finally 
meet you!!!

Anywayz, I totally forgot to meet up with Osby and have him show me the 
other SFraves cats...I was looking for Greg, but I didnt see him...(?)  
Anyway, this party was awesome, and I did learn one lesson: "Bring lots of 
alcohol to Apollo's parties!!!"

I could tell this party was amazing, I just didnt want to leave!  Many 
thanks to Apollo and the Moksha tribe for throwing an off tha hook party!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: BSP: Progression Last Night

It woulda been nice to have made it out to this little soire', but my boss 
decided to call me @ 7pm last night to tell me to come in early this morning 
to print out reports. The same reports I was working on all day Friday, and 
were 99% finished when my computer crashed. So I got to endure 20 minutes of 
being bitched at for "not doing my job" (nevermind that I'm doing MY job AND 
the new guys job,plus doing database programming that I wasn't hired to do). 
So, I've been here since 7:15, and I'm gonna be here til around 6pm or 
so....and that's just Monday.

Someone find me a better job! lol

That's Veanne aka DJ Mylai.

Here's an mp3 of her playing opposite my buddy Li.
http://mp3.cloudfactory.org/~djstonie/audio/oodevi/mylai_vs_li.mp3

She spins jungle (back a while ago) & two step mostly (nowadays), with
some breaks for good measure I thinks.

That would be Veanne/Mylai.

Jungle/Dnb, and yes, she's hot.

Me and my girlfriend went out and took a shower with her at an Oregon
campout earlier this year.

Whoops, said too much, later ;-)

Subject: [sfraves] Harvest:  Moksha Tribe Thanks You!!!

--=====================_9505838==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

On behalf of the Moksha Tribe collective, I offer our love, deepest respect 
and thanks to all of you who came out to share the dance floor with us on 
Saturday night at Harvest.

Major props to the Moksha crew, Viberation, and SWAT sound for putting so 
much DYI time, energy and muscle power into this production.  We all have 
very sore muscles today and I'm sure everyone could use one of those Ravin 
Riz massages right now:)

There is no party, however,  without our extended family -- you, our 
guests.  Those who came to this party were exemplars of those raver values 
of peace, love, unity and respect.  You all gave great vibe that night and 
made Harvest the success that it was.  Your generosity at Moksha parties 
must also be acknowledged here.  Today I cut a check for $600.00 to Larkin 
Street Youth Services, and we will be sending more donations when the 
accounts from Harvest are settled.

I experience much joy in throwing these parties as do the other Moksha 
Tribe members.  We all went into this a couple of years ago with the clear 
intention of bringing the best qualities of the rave underground into the 
present.  At each of our parties we ask our guests to write comments into a 
book so that we can understand if we are doing the right things.  Let me, 
therefore, share some moving thoughts from one of the Harvest dancers, 
called "Testimony of an ex-jaded Raver":

"Dear Moksha Tribe,

Let me say that after only ninety minutes at Harvest this experience was, 
without a doubt, the best event I have had the honor of experiencing in 
over 4 years of our culture.  The vibe of your, nay, our people was 
celestial.  I have never felt so proud of our culture in my life.  I do 
feel a sense of shame at the fact that I have neglected our importance for 
so long.  At first, I knew not the essence of our culture -- only a small 
albeit perverse taste --after all, such was the vibe of Oakland of years 
ago (Homebase, etc.).  After Harvest, however, I feel our culture has been 
justified.  The potential which each human being has was permuted into 
Heaven.  Moksha, my eternal thanks.  I look forward to the day when I can 
walk with you on the path to transcendence."

There are many other comments like this in our Guest Book.  Years ago it 
used to be the rule rather than the exception that folks would have 
life-transforming experiences at raves.  This was what the community was 
all about.  This is what Moksha is all about.  My own life was changed for 
the better when I came into raving.  It is our hope at Moksha that these 
parties bring magic, light and hope, through the ecstatic dynamic of music 
and dance, the union of sweat and spirit, body and soul, into the lives of 
our extraordinary community.

Amber, one of our house photographers, has posted some pics of both the set 
up and party 
here: 
<http://timeformetofly.com/photos/harvest111503/>http://timeformetofly.com/photos/harvest111503/

We also recorded all of the sets on digital video and we will try to share 
these in future.

Moksha is now planning our second anniversary party which is scheduled for 
early next year.

Again, our heartfelt thanks to those of you gave each other and the Moksha 
collective such a memorable evening!!!!

Much love and respect,

Apollo for Moksha Tribe

Besides lacking a sampler, what's the major difference's between the 600 =
and the 3000 models? Obviously size, however, I am curious how much they =
might differ in sound specs. Anyone have any ideas..I don't mind =
opinions, but, I am really looking for concrete differences, like I know =
that the 3000 has all digital outputs, that type of stuff.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [sfraves] Personal "Harvest" Thank-you to Moksha crew

To the dear members of the Moksha Tribe crew (all of you): I didn't sign the guest book at Harvest, so I just wanted to post a public message.

Thanks so much for the great time Saturday night. I know that you guys worked really hard to plan this party. It was a seamless effort from the guests perspective. 

I danced so hard that I had cramps the next day. Thats what I get for drinking and dancing! But I did appreciate the crew members who were distributing water to dehydrated dancers on the floor. Thats a true sign of caring.

The evening went by so fast that everything is a blur. I met so many people and saw familiar faces, too. Got a few CDs to boot, from Phaedrus and ShezTek! Thanks guys.

Ummm, about the music for the night: I think it was just sexy. Thats all I can say. I got the vibe in more ways than one. Give me some more! 

If you have any doubts about all of your hard work, shake them off, because I want to give all of you a shout-out for taking time out of your busy lives to make a community, for one night or for eternity.

Sincerely,
Greg VP

Subject: [sfraves] Old XLR8R magazines for sale

I was cleaning out the garage today and found a box full of old XLR8R
magazines from way back.

I have issues 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26


If anybody is interested I'll sell them for the first reasonable offer.

Subject: [sfraves] Clear & Present Danger (was Re: NRR: the matrix:revolutions)

	One film I can strongly recommend is "Clear And Present Danger." It's 
based on a Tom Clancy book and stars Harrison Ford. This is nothing as 
deep, imaginative, or ground-breaking as "The Matrix" -- it's not 
calling the masses to action or addressing deeper problems facing 
society, merely telling a story about how an honest, well-placed 
insider with good survival skills might prevail over cold, ruthless 
corruption reaching to the highest levels of the U.S. government. 
What's at stake is nothing as grand as the existence of the human race 
or civilization as we know it. But for an action thriller about power 
out of control (which is essentially what "The Matrix" is), CPD 
presents a chillingly plausible scenario with relatively little 
exaggeration.

Subject: [sfraves] Film Premier this Friday! URGENT! Action needs to be taken! (nrr)

If you give a damn about this world or know someone who does, please read and come this Friday. Forests provide habitats for more than 80% of our country's wildlife species, and only 4% of the world's forests are left. 90% of these forests are parks. Upwards of 50,000 species are estimated to be driven to extinction each year due to this forest destruction. At this rate with other combined factors, humans are fueling the fastest mass extinction is history (up to 100-1000x more accelerated) that isn't too far off in the horizon. SCARY. In addition, we are at the mercy of corporations now more than ever and at a critical point in what will be history. Action needs to be taken now before it is too late.

Please come to help spread awareness of this growing epidemic and learn what you can do about it. If anything, this is an incredibly beautiful and well done film about something very close to home, and it gives you something NRR to do on a Friday night (but still time to do so if you choose!) . Details are below.

On Friday, November 21st, I will be hosting a world wide video premier of the re-edited documentary Tree Sit: The Art of Resistance in Olney Hall at the College of Marin Kentfield Campus (835 College Ave, Kentfield), in Marin County. The co-producer will be providing an introduction as well as Q&A session at the conclusion of the film, and other guest speakers are currently in the works. The event will start at 7:00PM and conclude at an estimated time of 10:00PM, with a ticket charge of a suggested $10.00. Any additional donations are gladly accepted! 
    
Please forward this letter to anyone you know who is conscious minded, an earth-lover, a tree-hugger, a concerned human being, a closet ecologist/biologist, an open-minded conservative, A CITIZEN OF THE PLANET EARTH etc., etc. This film should be introduced to people of all back-rounds to spread awareness of this growing epidemic, as action needs to be taken NOW before it is too late. A description of the film is below. 
    
If you would like to become a volunteer for the event, guest speaker, sponsor or contributor, please e-mail me at Alida@viberation.com or LittleEtoile@aol.com. All proceeds from this event will be donated to HAVC & Earth Films to aid in the continuation of their work and movement toward increased awareness and education. 
    

    This film is an epic saga of the destruction of North America's oldest temperate rainforests, told through the eyes of dedicated and courageous forest defenders who share their insights from their perches high in the trees. While on the ground, local residents, Native Americans, biologists, loggers, and government officials make their opinions known. These intimate and heartrending tales from the edge of the disappearing wilderness bear witness to a vast battle which rages over our entire planet!

Beautiful nature footage mixed with a powerful hypnotic soundtrack tie together
both the history of this modern struggle and the immediacy of one of today's
most pressing unresolved problems.

The now famous Julia Butterfly who lived for 2 years non-stop in an enormous
redwood, and numerous other tree-sitters, (less famous but equally courageous),
describe a new found spiritual and ecological wisdom that correspond with
indigenous beliefs that hold the Mother Earth as sacred. Wall St., corporations
and Government see it differently, as a commodity to be utilized through
exploitation.

Beyond the stereotypes of hippie tree-huggers vs. redneck loggers, this film
explores the dire ecological and real economic issues intertwined with the
ancient forests, from global warming to clean water to the WTO protests in
Seattle and the emerging anti-globalization movement.

TREE-SIT is comprised of short segments that include the assassination attempt
on Earth First! organizer Judi Bari, the campaign to save Headwaters Forest, the
United Steelworkers Union joining forces with environmentalists to challenge Big
Business, the near extinction of wild salmon, and the government corruption and
growing police state that undermines real democracy.  A scathing indictment of
"free market" economics that connects such diverse issues as political prisoners
in America (Leonard Peltier) with rural residents suffering from loss of
drinking water due to deforestation, flooding and herbicide spraying.  Features Woody Harrelson, Bonnie Raitt, Joan Baez and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead.

TREE-SIT reaches into times past and future, showing the historical continuity
of this very up-to-the-minute movement. A whirlwind ride, not to be missed!

I'm really very sad to hear of his loss.  But we have roaming and 
stationary safety people with radio headphones all over the place at 
parties to help prevent any harm to our guests.  The first thing David 
should have done when he discovered that his wallet was missing was notify 
one of us.  We just might have been able to do something about this 
then.  I don't understand why this wasn't brought to our attention at the 
time. If indeed their was a thief in our midst we could have perhaps been 
on alert and protected others from harm.

Love,

Apollo

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"It is not the same to talk of the bulls as to be in the bullring."
-Spanish Proverb

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  brandon @ breakhouse @ chi chi on thurs

ah, joyous thursdays!  it's almost the weekend, but then again not quite.  
but that's no excuse not to leave the comforts of home and get funky and 
drunky.

i'm spinning this thursday at the chi chi lounge! come check it out. no 
cover, nice venue, good sound system. come have a drink with me (or two, or 
three!) and get down to some tasty breaks and house.

your plan:  warm up at the thirsty bear with sticky and good beer.  then 
head due north until you see the bright lights and strip clubs and duck into 
the Chi Chi.  pay nothing at the door, use the money you just saved on 
drinks, shake your groove thing on the dancefloor!  afterwards, sober up at 
a nearby strip joint and then eat cheap, greasy chinese food at sun hong 
kong.  sound good?

Breakhouse Thursdays @
Chi-Chi Club
440 Broadway St.
(between Montgomery & Kearney)
Thursday, 11/20

9-9:45 Carolyn Holmes

9:45-10:30 Colin Duwe

10:30-11:15 Pete Calaway

11:15-12:00 DJ Bam (that's me!)

12:00-12:45 Bryan Bence

see you on the dancefloor!

Subject: [sfraves] Re: On being a slut

	Nothing wrong with the word "slut" if not used derogatorily. I'd say 
"high sex drive and playful" captures it perfectly! Recommended: "The 
Ethical Slut" (book) by Dossie Easton and Catherine Liszt.

Slutty & proud,

lol Dave. I recognize that!  From "Office Space"!   I used to work in a place 
that was exactly like that. We had to keep track of our time three different 
ways, in addition to card-keying in and out every time we went to the 
bathroom. Then they would get on our case for not being productive enough. For a while 
I was literally documenting how I spent every minute of the day. Doing so 
takes a lot of time away from actually working!

Wow.. those visuals were dope on 5 screens!

I do have to admit that Andy & Chris J spun a really Awesome tag set that night that got me ooooh man... I Loved it!  It was all Techno then Chris busted out some Electro that ooooh yeah... got me Groovin' so hard!  BUt I Loved the tricks they both used on each others mixes when they got all these groovy ass tunes goin' @ the same time & it was jus' a f uckin' orchestra of Techno & yummy beats!!

I don't remember if he spun an idustrial in his set like he was tellin' me he was gonna do a few weeeks ago... but that sooo did not matter 'cause it was a fun ride during his set!!  There was this one somg that came on during his set that I jus' Loved, but I guess it wouldn't do any good tryin' 2 mention it since I can't describe how it souinded really via jus' words...BUt oooh my goodness Dude...

Thank U 4 the set Hak... I loved it sooo much!  Hak... I was sooooo happy 2 C U there that night man & I totally Loved your set so much!

I did like Reclipses set alot. but I was well... I was kinda confused @ that point... I did dance a lil' during his set, but I honestly think I was in the other room more during this set!!  I mean.. Hello 2Day, how are U suppose 2 decide what room 2 be in during Yummy sets!!  It sucked!!  BUt as much as I can remember during his set... there was some core goin' on that well... anything core I Love ofcourse!

OK... I don't wanna make this longert than it already is... but AAAAAAAAAALL the DJs did bang up jubs that night!!  Hak let me know that Phaedrus was up on alota rubadub during his set & Wow.... I Loved it! Ofcourse Calamity Jane tore it up when she spun her breakbeats & hardhouse!  Jauncy spun Breakbeats this time around & it was sick!  NomadicDJ played this really Awesom set!  It was all "Dark Wave" (a term he told me he invented) which is like mmmm... say like 80's depeche mode/ New Order style  music now... then I don't remember if he did end up playing some break beats, but he did play some trance which started out pretty dark but got 2 B kinda foo foo towrds the end of his set... LoL <3 U Carl!  Shaen Allen played this proper Tach House set & I was there 4 the whole set about... I Loved it!! OK, lastly, V0lljude spun this Awesome down tempo set that well... I was 2 up 2 chill so yeah.. I couldn't really hang out in that room 2 much... LoL

a bit of feces on it too.  (I'm guessing he owns the building.)

How do you use "slut" in a non-derogatory way?

Like- "you tarty trollop! what a saucy slut you are!"?

it comes with a new SIM chip as well (from the phone I just bought). It =

earpiece (never used), charger and leather case for it. I'll take $20, =
or a good 12 pack of beer.

Hit me back if you're interested.

no, it doesn't depend on how you view the word "slut"

words are arbitrary vocal symbols, but if we don't agree on the common 
meaning, there's no point; communication fails.  there is, in fact, no 
positive definition for slut, despite what Dossie Easton and Catherine 
Liszt seem to think.  It takes more than a couple feminists to change the 
language.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: On being a slut

You would have to follow that by 'nooch' or 'buuuung.'

I find this a lil interesting.

 Webster's 1913 Dictionary    Definition:
\Slut\, n. [OE. slutte; cf. OD. slodde a slut, Icel.
sl["o]ttr a heavy, loglike fellow, slota to droop.]
1. An untidy woman; a slattern.

         Sluts are good enough to make a sloven's porridge.
                                               --Old Proverb.

2. A servant girl; a drudge. [Obs.]

         Our little girl Susan is a most admirable slut, and
         pleases us mightly, doing more service than both the
         others.                               --Pepys.

3. A female dog; a bitch.

So basically this can take on a few things.  Bitch has become rathercommon
and can be taken with levity or disgust depending on vocal intonations.Also,
a girl wouldn't be a slut in the sexual sense if she kept herself tidyand/or
guys treated her better than a servant.  So in essence, its guysthat make a
woman a slut by treating her like a servant....-Rayn (sorry about da

Nathan,

	Same way you use any descriptive word in a non-derogatory way -- make 
it clear from your tone and the context that you mean it as a 
compliment or at least aren't implying anything negative.

	You can even go a step further by letting others know that a positive 
meaning is the only one you recognize. For instance, if somebody says 
"that guy is such a slut!" and it's obviously meant as a put-down, you 
can respond enthusiastically with something like, "Yeah, he's the 
bomb!"  8)

Groove on,

interesting thread- mostly because people aren't reflexively flinching in an overly PC kinda way.  I agree with the statement that it all has to do with context.  For one, to me, the term doesn't really have much to do with how much sex someone (male or female) has, but rather, how they have sex - and not physically but *psychologically*.  
 
I think the word slut is a loaded statement because our society comes from this puritanitcal, sexist background and people who cling to those kind of hang ups - those people will attach meaning to that word. IMO, if you've got self respect and a healthy attitude toward sex- numbers don't mean anything.  

Another way to put it is, you can have sex with very few people, but if you are completely self debasing and indulging in inappropriate guilt, shame and all kinds of fucked up thinking, then maybe thats what a slut is!  perhaps?

I find this a lil interesting.

Webster's 1913 Dictionary Definition:
\Slut\, n. [OE. slutte; cf. OD. slodde a slut, Icel.
sl["o]ttr a heavy, loglike fellow, slota to droop.]
1. An untidy woman; a slattern.

Sluts are good enough to make a sloven's porridge.
--Old Proverb.

2. A servant girl; a drudge. [Obs.]

Our little girl Susan is a most admirable slut, and
pleases us mightly, doing more service than both the
others. --Pepys.

3. A female dog; a bitch.

So basically this can take on a few things. Bitch has become rathercommon
and can be taken with levity or disgust depending on vocal intonations.Also,
a girl wouldn't be a slut in the sexual sense if she kept herself tidyand/or
guys treated her better than a servant. So in essence, its guysthat make a
woman a slut by treating her like a servant....-Rayn (sorry about da

I dunno. I'll step out on a limb here and say a slut is still a slut.

There's nothing wrong with sex. It's quite possibly one of the most
beautiful acts human beings can engage in. Sex is a big defining factor of
what makes us human. That said, it can also be one of the most debased and
fucked up acts we can engage in. There's a difference between good sex,
where you feel excellent afterwards, and sex where you just feel like shit
afterwards.

I would consider a slut someone who doesn't know the difference. Probably
due to some kind of lack or internal rockiness, they get it whenever and
wherever they can, as often as they can. Bad sex just means you gotta have
more to fix the bad feeling. I'd liken it to a really pathological drug
addiction.

That said, people probably shouldn't talk shit about sluts, as it isn't
really their fault. We don't talk shit about people with other psychiatric
disorders.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: On being a slut

I use the term "slut" in a positive context personally. If I was thinking in 
terms of "a person who fucks random people with no discretion or care for 
one's self, safety, or respect", I would use the term "whore" (not to be 
confused with "prostitute", which is someone who earns money through sex).

Of course I'm weird. *shrug*

Those masterful images because complete
Grew in pure mind, but out of what began?
A mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street,
Old kettles, old bottles, and a broken can,
Old iron, old bones, old rages, that raving slut
Who keeps the till. Now that my ladder is gone,
I must lie down where all the ladders start,
In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart.

guess maybe I wasn't that clear then... with the exception of "a slut is a slut" you reword the same basic thing I was saying, or trying to say!
 
the point we agree on is(I think)- its all about your state of mind and self respect. 

Sean Griffith <srg@pdx.edu> wrote:

I dunno. I'll step out on a limb here and say a slut is still a slut.

There's nothing wrong with sex. It's quite possibly one of the most
beautiful acts human beings can engage in. Sex is a big defining factor of
what makes us human. That said, it can also be one of the most debased and
fucked up acts we can engage in. There's a difference between good sex,
where you feel excellent afterwards, and sex where you just feel like shit
afterwards.

I would consider a slut someone who doesn't know the difference. Probably
due to some kind of lack or internal rockiness, they get it whenever and
wherever they can, as often as they can. Bad sex just means you gotta have
more to fix the bad feeling. I'd liken it to a really pathological drug
addiction.

That said, people probably shouldn't talk shit about sluts, as it isn't
really their fault. We don't talk shit about people with other psychiatric
disorders.

Subject: [sfraves] <bsp> 80's *teeeease* party end of Jan.

after a night of rediculous bullsh*tting & too many
expired domestic fo'ties, the idea to throw an 80's
party in full gear, in all it's glory, was born.  so,
with the help of a few select members of crews from
all over, it's going to happen.

this will be a costume affair - i want gaudy prom
dresses, i want pretty in pink meets breakfast club
meets teen wolf, lost boys, repo man and surf nazis
must die.  give me the BANG, mohawks, layered
multi-colored socks, stiletto boots, ruffled tuxedos. 
basically, let's go crazy people.  i'm also intending,
for those who weren't fortunate to fully live the 80's
past padded pajamas, to have a table fully stocked
with as many 80's accoutrements (clothing, etc) as
possible.  since aqua net was one of those *musts*,
this table will most likely fall under the non-smoking
section.

this event will also be an invite only, BYOB affair. 
if you want to come, you need to email me privately. 
more details will follow and i'll be sending another
note out with the lineup as soon as it comes to a
close.   

like, righteous!
calamity

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Act NOW to protect medical marijuana patients

--=====================_1741604==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

*** Act NOW to protect medical marijuana patients, preserve the
     right of judges to show compassion for deserving defendants, and
     save taxpayer money

Now, just before Congress goes out of session, one of the country's 
harshest drug war extremists, Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN), is about to 
introduce some of the scariest legislation we've seen this year.

Rep. Souder's bill increases penalties for many drug offenses and takes 
away the right of judges to show mercy when it's appropriate. The bill also 
enacts new draconian penalties that could sentence compassionate Americans 
that grow and provide medical marijuana to decades in federal prison.

Although it's titled the 'Drug Sentencing Reform Act,' this dangerous bill 
is all sentencing and no reform. It will destroy the lives of thousands 
more non-violent Americans.

We know that Rep. Souder wants to introduce his bill within the next couple 
of weeks and is asking for co-sponsorship from other Representatives. Make 
sure your Representative doesn't support this bill. Call NOW and tell your 
Representative not to co-sponsor Rep. Souder's Drug Sentencing Reform Act 
because it contains no reform and ties the hands of judges.

Actions to Take:

1) CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE NOW!
To reach your representative by phone, call the US Capitol Switchboard at 
1-800-839-5276 or call your representative's office directly by looking up 
the phone number on http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=9389 .

Tell your Representative: "I'm a constituent and I'm calling to urge Rep. 
[Name] not to co-sponsor Rep. Souder's Drug Sentencing Reform Act, which he 
is about to introduce. The Drug Sentencing Reform Act contains no reform 
and ties the hands of judges. It will punish nonviolent Americans and 
compassionate citizens that provide patients with medical marijuana. I 
would like Rep. [Name] to tell me where s/he stands on this bill. S/he can 
send a letter to me at [Address] or an e-mail to [Address]. Thank you for 
your time."

2) Forward this alert to your friends, family, and co-workers.

More Information:

The so-called Drug Sentencing Reform Act has yet to be introduced, but it 
will do the following:

** Tie the hands of judges by making it harder for them to reduce sentences 
for non-violent drug offenders. (It does this by expanding the so-called 
'Feeney Amendment' to apply to drug offenses). This will mean longer 
sentences for non-violent offenses, with taxpayers like you picking up the 
cost!

** Mandates that most people on parole, probation or supervised release be 
subjected to random drug testing, even if their original offense had 
nothing to do with drugs. (If enacted, thousands of non-violent Americans 
could be sent to prison for years for smoking marijuana in the privacy of 
their own home and then failing a drug test.)

** Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to no longer allow lower 
sentences for non-violent drug offenders that have certain mitigating 
circumstances (such as being addicted to drugs) or for non-violent drug 
offenders that made a mistake and are otherwise good citizens.

** Enacts new draconian penalties for growing, distributing, and providing 
'high-potency' marijuana to others, including medical marijuana - which 
often has a higher potency to better relieve the suffering of AIDS, Cancer, 
and other patients. If enacted, this provision will allow the federal 
government to send more medical marijuana patients and their caregivers to 
federal prison for years, in some cases decades.

** Read Rep. Souder's explanation of his bill here: 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=9390. Our analysis is 
based on Souder's explanation and our discussions with congressional staffers.

after a night of rediculous bullsh*tting & too many
expired domestic fo'ties, the idea to throw an 80's
party in full gear, in all it's glory, was born.  so,
with the help of a few select members of crews from
all over, it's going to happen.

this will be a costume affair - i want gaudy prom
dresses, i want pretty in pink meets breakfast club
meets teen wolf, lost boys, repo man and surf nazis
must die.  give me the BANG, mohawks, layered
multi-colored socks, stiletto boots, ruffled tuxedos.
basically, let's go crazy people.  i'm also intending,
for those who weren't fortunate to fully live the 80's
past padded pajamas, to have a table fully stocked
with as many 80's accoutrements (clothing, etc) as
possible.  since aqua net was one of those *musts*,
this table will most likely fall under the non-smoking
section.

this event will also be an invite only, BYOB affair.
if you want to come, you need to email me privately.
more details will follow and i'll be sending another
note out with the lineup as soon as it comes to a
close.

like, righteous!

Subject: [sfraves] Re: On being a slut

	Hmm... As far as I'm aware, the term "whore" always refers to selling 
oneself, not one's degree of promiscuousness. I'll note that as someone 
in that line of work myself [we prefer to be called "escorts"; I'm 
personally fond of "courtesan" 8) ], I've observed that people in this 
profession tend to be *more* careful than other folks about issues of 
safety, respect, and personal boundaries when it comes to sex, not less.

	I don't think I've ever met *anyone*, male or female, who fucks people 
at *random*, any more than I've ever met anyone who eats food at 
random. Some people make choices about sex partners, quickly, easily, 
and frequently; this does not mean that the sex is necessarily bad, or 
that they are reckless, or that they lack self-respect. These negative 
stereotypes are generally perpetuated by those who are uncomfortable 
with sluts.

Groove on,

-------------------------------1069292315
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I agree that having a forum like SFR to talk about things back and forth is 
fun. However, people on SF Raves knock Bayraves a lot for being 
stupid/childish/whatever, so I spent some time reading the postings on Bayraves in order to 
compare. Yes, there is a lot of fluff and silly drama, and useless posts which 
say nothing but "Werd!". The difference? They actually talk about raves!  They 
talk about the past weekend's parties. They talk about how one person's 
hedonistic behavior can ruin a party, or even cause a venue to get shut down. 
Technical reasons make it easier to navigate through Bayraves. A lot of 
postings are frivolous, but you can scroll through them quickly, rather than having 
to open up each piece of mail as on SFR. 
Osby gives us great party reviews, and some of you others do, too. A lot  of 
the SFR postings are very much DJ-oriented, not raver-oriented, and that's 
fine. And I love the non-rave-related topics as long as they say NRR on them. 
Almost any topic can be interesting if it's not done to death. 

The "slut" topic has been done to death. Enough, already! Thank you. 
I was noticing that BayRaves has a long thread about which DJs are hot, but 
note ... many of the comments may be sily and immature, but at least they're 
talking about DJs and not some completely unrelated subject. 
Hugs to all of you, I just wish some of these NRR topics would die off a 
little quicker than they do.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: On being a slut

Slut is a derogatory descriptive word.. so if I say "he's such a slut", and 
you retort "He's the bomb!" the meaning would be that you're glad he's a 
slut, or at least happy with it.  That doesn't make being a slut a good thing.

Wow, you take money for sex?  Previously, I had little respect for you.. now..

There's some people I can introduce you to..  I've met people that both 
fuck randomly and eat randomly.  sorry you've missed out.  I agree that 
frequency doesn't directly relate to recklessness, lack of self--respect, 
or bad sex.. but that doesn't mean there aren't numerous other factors that 
do.  OF COURSE a sex worker is going to be careful - if you get sick, you 
can't work...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Cool, cheap infolines!


hello =] my name is kim.. some of you might know me, i'm a hyperreal
volunteer and have been subscribed to all the hyperreal lists at one point
or another because i like to travel. i'm a longtime music writer/website
admin/bedroom dj/gathering facilitator/dancesafe volunteer/music law
activist etc. blah blah blah.

i'm now working at a telcom, so i figured i'd torment all of you by
spamming you about infolines. i did put blatant self promotion in the
subject line in case that's still a filter.. i know it is on the northwest
raves list. anyway, here's the spam: the company i work for has really
cheap voicemail numbers that are great for infolines. they also take
faxes, which makes them cool for promoters because booking agents can fax
you over dj contracts, etc. there are local numbers in most area codes and
also toll free numbers. you can get custom numbers too, like
1-800-LUV-TKNO.
you can listen to the voicemail/view the faxes online and it can notify
you when you get one to an email address, cellphone text messaging
address, or pager. it also keeps a list of everyone who's ever called. if
you want more info on the specifics of this.. email me! :)

if you want to hear what it sounds like, i run a number called the seattle
techno infoline.. it lists all upcoming electronic music events here. it's
not specific to any one promoter or club, but it'd give you an idea
anyway.. 206.686.3151. :D

</ spam>. sorry. *spanks self* i know you hate me now. but you are free at
last! no more from me! it's over! it makes everything else seem much
better in comparison!

for anyone who made it this far, i also wanted to add two non-spam related
things:

1) if any of you use soulseek for file sharing and are into microhouse,
detroit techno, deep/tech house, idm, indie rock, hiphop, etc.. add
'groovinkim' to your list and trade with me!
2) if there's a damn good large-scale event coming up, i want to know
about it. in the past few years i've travelled to atlanta, chicago,
detroit,
barcelona, vancouver, berlin, amsterdam, paris, san francisco, etc. for
events and want an excuse to do so again. this year i may skip demf for
mutek but will definitely return to sonar.. (http://www.sonar.es - you
should go to this or die trying.) add somewhere else to my list! heh.

like you really care who this person is that's spamming you with this
massive email, but if you are curious, here are some of my sites:
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/nw
http://www.nwtekno.org
http://www.seattletechno.com

i'm not always evil, just on wednesdays. ;)

DECIBLAST RADIO - Thursday November 20th, 2003

It's BACK!!! We'll be streaming at full cd quality! Also, the 
broadcasts will be bi-weekly from now on.

I'd like to announce a new photographer, EDDIE "KOVERT". I've been 
trying to get him to come on for a while. I'm glad to have gotten to 
know him this summer and i'm sure there will be lots of great pics to 
come. Hopefully he'll start pumping up the djing too!

New resident DJ's THOMAS KENT and APOT. Kent is the fukken man. He runs 
Ill Behavior and in his spare time directs tug boats around the bay. 
He's also an excellent dj. Apot has been rockin parties for the past 3 
months. It's funny because everytime I play he's on at the same time 
and his room is packed. Oh well. :)

WAVELENGTH (Deciblast.org/Oneiromancy) 6PM - 7PM
THOMAS KENT (Deciblast.org/Ill Behavior) 7PM - 8PM
ELEMENT (Deciblast.org/Modified) 8PM-9PM
APOT (Deciblast.org) 9PM-10PM
THE DOCTOR (Deciblast.org/LiquidVinylDJs/Bayraves) 10PM-11PM

LISTEN: The broadcast will be streamed online at 128kps mp3 at 
deciblast.org. In association with Afterhoursdjs. Go to the Deciblast 
home page. Under Latest news, click LISTEN.

All sets will be recorded and uploaded onto deciblast.org.

Go Join SCR Jonny -- that list has some of the most interesting 
discussions I've ever seen. Even after moving to San Francisco I've 
kept reading my So-Cal Raves mail. But... they don't really seem to 
talk about raves much either -- then again -- I don't really care. Its 
not like I'm being forced to read about topics I'm not interested in. 
Jonny get rid of your AOL -- get a real ISP, run a real mail browser 
and stop complaining about people engaging in conversations that for 
whatever reason don't seem to interest you in particular.

I think the popular common definition that comes to mind quickest is a girl who has sex a lot, with a lot of different people.  An easy lay.

 

A rather sexist term.  I have had a lot of sex with a lot of different people, but I am a guy, so I am a stud rather than a slut.  Its an old, tired, view of the world, but one which many people still have, if only in the back of their mind.  After all, its one that is driven into your subconscious by mass media all your life.

 

Taking a more thoughtful approach to the word, I would have to agree that the term tends to define the attitude that goes with the sex, not just the amount.  Slut implies one who has a low threshold or means of determining who they have sex with, not necessarily just quantity, but quality.

 

Personally, I dont think bad of sluts or sex or fucking the brains out of everyone you meet.  If you want to do that, cool.  

 

I DO think telling me what I can or cant do, and trying to limit my personal choices by using words conceived and used in a way to control me, well, is bullshit.  So go fuck yourself.  I will fuck who and what and how often I want.  And no one has the right to brand me anything.

 

Someone give me a letter S to wear.

               Hmm... As far as I'm aware, the term "whore" always refers to selling 

oneself, not one's degree of promiscuousness. I'll note that as someone 

in that line of work myself [we prefer to be called "escorts"; I'm 

personally fond of "courtesan" 8) ], I've observed that people in this 

profession tend to be *more* careful than other folks about issues of 

safety, respect, and personal boundaries when it comes to sex, not 

less.

 

               I don't think I've ever met *anyone*, male or female, who fucks people 

at *random*, any more than I've ever met anyone who eats food at 

random. Some people make choices about sex partners, quickly, easily, 

and frequently; this does not mean that the sex is necessarily bad, or 

that they are reckless, or that they lack self-respect. These negative 

stereotypes are generally perpetuated by those who are uncomfortable 

with sluts.

 

Groove on,

                                                                                                         <<< Starchild >>>

I find that incredibly hard to believe. Apparently you never went to a 
public high school, or American college where this sort of behaviour runs 
rampant.

I don't have a problem with people being what may be considered "loose" by 
most moral definitions, but I have a problem with people who are unsafe or 
not very selective in whom they choose to scrog. For instance, people who 
have no problem sleeping with people for their looks alone...I find that 
pretty disrespectful. Not to say looks aren't a huge part of who one might 
sleep with, but I personally feel it shouldn't be the only basis. I'm of the 
mind set, that if I couldn't have a conversation with the person I'm 
fucking, then I don't wanna be with them. If I couldn't be friends with the 
person, then I wouldn't bother. Of course, I'm not saying that means "no 
casual sex", because, a "friend with benefits" can be a great thing, and 
that's definately more on the casual side of things. But fucking for the 
sake of fucking is like using a person to masturbate with, and I'd rather 
use my hand if that's what it came down to. Of course, that's ME....I don't 
expect anyone else to buy into my personal philosophies....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Progression Sessions Vol. 03

my friend Andy pointed out that this is not an EP and I just wanted to
clarify before I get an onslaught of emails. Andy is right - This is not
original work; this is a mixset recorded live at our monthly.

Respect due to those making original music, I did not intend to come off
that way and I am glad Andy pointed this out.

Thus, Progression Sessions is born.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp - kim sin (NV) tonight at thirstybear thirsdays!

this week at thirstybear thirsdays, the ambient mafia is proud
to present dj kim sin!

kim has headlined events in nevada such as "pure", and is the
founder of the "winedown" parties (NV) and "bump" (sac). 
tonight she's going to slap all of your asses back into place
with some deep and funky house.

her cohort tonight will be yours truly, spinning whatever i can
stuff into my crate.  i'm planning on house, but i think
someone slipped some acid into my soy milk, so anything's
possible...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: help, lady trouble.

Thanks to everyone who has shown support of my misadventured, over dramatic 
life.  I need to stop posting when I'm trashed though...  As an update, I 
know that I'll see "her" on Saturday night and I'll just talk to her and see 
what happens.  Like riding the wave, or whatever.
Peace. Love. Unity. Blasphemy. Love. Peace. Unity. Whatever.
Joe.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RSM: SRR: Roll Cal for Thirsty Bear / DJ Bam Afterparty

ah yes, following the bear there is another option other than bad kitty cats 
at anu! (and no disrespect to sarah, i like anu and have attended thursday 
nights.  good stuff!)

i'm spinning tonight at the Chi Chi Lounge (or bar?  i don't even know the 
real name!) in north beach on broadway (near montgomery).

it's free.  no cover.  yes, that's right!  who the hell would pay to hear me 
DJ?  you'd have to be out of your mind!  and Chi Chi is a nice space, good 
sound and comfy places to lounge about.  join me in a drink and afterwards 
we can hit up a strip club and stumble back to our cars if we can remember 
where we parked them!

so here's the info.

BREAK HOUSE THURSDAY  11/20/03
Chi Chi Lounge
440 Broadway (at Kearny/Montgomery)

9-9:45 Colin Duwe
9:45-10:30 D Spurlock
10:30-11:15 DJ BAM
11:15-12:00 Sneke Pete
12:00-12:45 Bryan Bence

Subject: [sfraves]nrr: DJs! 33 and 45 rpms?

Aight, I have scoured the net, asked several forums...and still, have come 
up with nothing.  Why is the industry standard for vinyl records 331/3 rpm 
and 45 rpm?  Here is an informative link:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/features/vinyl/

The only thing I can find in the above link is, 331/3 rpms was the same 
running speed as movies back in the day.

Is it simply, that is the speed that everyone agreed on?  What about 78s?  I 
do know 78 - 33 = 45.  Hopefully this thread will bring up some interesting 
discussions.

Peace

Subject: [sfraves] Re: On being a slut

	Let's examine what it would mean to truly fuck people at random. This 
would mean, walking down the street, that the person would be as likely 
to come onto an 80-year-old guy as a 20-year-old guy. And that's just 
for starters. Next you'd have to imagine no preferences for looks, 
disability status, gender, or personal hygiene.

	Have you ever met anyone of whom you think this is true? I haven't. So 
I think we can safely forget about the idea that anyone is truly random 
in his or her choice of sexual partners.

	The feeling that looks shouldn't count for everything, and that 
friendship, or at least the potential for it, should be in there 
somewhere, is a common perspective. And I can sympathize with this 
desire for all sex to be positive on all levels. In an ideal world, it 
would be.

	I'd similarly prefer all my consumer interactions to be positive on 
all levels. When I go shopping, I'd much rather give my money to 
someone with whom I could have a conversation, or be friends, than 
somebody I don't find very likable. But unfortunately I can't have 
solely positive consumer interactions without greatly diminishing my 
quality of life. If I find a really cool pair of shoes at a really 
great price, I'm not going to pass them up just because I can't imagine 
myself being friends with the person behind the counter. If I only 
bought goods or services from people I really like, a lot of my needs 
would go unmet. I have yet to find a bank I feel very good about, but 
I'm not willing to give up having a checking account.

	I feel the same way about sex. Sure I'd prefer that all my partners be 
nice people with whom I have something in common besides physical 
attraction. But if Pam Anderson came to my door begging to be fucked do 
you think I'd turn her away? Not a chance! Lots of people believe a 
willingness to sleep with someone just on the basis of physical desire 
cheapens sex. I disagree. You can still have sex with someone who 
resonates with you on many levels and you care a lot about some other 
time, and perhaps even enjoy it more than you would have without the 
other experience. A nutritious salad tends to taste even better if all 
you've eaten all day are chocolate eclairs. I'm not on a sexual diet, 
so why shouldn't I try to enjoy both?

Proud to be a slut,

AFAIK it's just higher fidelity.

Vinyl and tape are essentially "digital" in the dense
that they have a sampling rate and a bit depth limited
by the physical charachteristics of the media itself.
A 45rpm record fits the same amount of information in
to a larger space than a 33rpm record. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves]nrr: DJs! 33 and 45 rpms?

A quick search and this is what I found-

http://members.tripod.com/~Vinylville/spindoc.html 



Explainations of why certain speeds were chosen for certain types of
phonograph recordings... 

s p i n s   d o c t o r e d
___________________________ 

    q. Does anyone know why 78 revolutions per minute was chosen
    as the standard rotation speed of old-fashioned gramophone
    records, rather than a round number such as 75 or 80 rpm?
    And are there convincing explanations for the choice of
    speeds for later EPs and LPs of 33 1/3 rpm and 45 rpm?

    JAMES LEE
    Oisterwijk
    The Netherlands
    ____________________________________________________________

    a. It was Emil Berliner, the inventor of the gramophone, who
    determined roughly how fast old disc records should spin. He
    avoided Edison's need for a stylus made from precious jewels
    by using points which could be made from steel sewing
    needles and pins. The size of the stylus effectively
    determined the size of the grooves in a record and the
    recordable frequency range limited by this groove size
    determined a speed between 70 and 90 rpm.

    Standardisation did not begin until 1912, when the British
    Gramophone Company conducted listening tests on their back
    catalogue. They settled on the average (or possibly the
    median) of these tests, which turned out to be 78 rpm. Other
    companies adopted this, but the process was not complete
    until the early 1930s. Even after this date rogue rpm
    records still appeared. After standardisation problems still
    occurred. Because of electrical mains frequencies
    differences on opposite sides of the Atlantic, stroboscopic
    speed testers and synchronous motors meant a nominal speed
    of 77.922 rpm in countries that used 50 hertz and 78.261 in
    countries that used 60 hertz. These were later fixed in
    national (but not international) standards. 

    Records of 33 1/3 rpm were developed in conjunction with
    films. A 12-inch 78 with Berliner-type grooves could hold
    between 4 and 5 minutes per side. The first practical sound
    films produced in the US in the late 1920s had their sound
    on separate disc records and it was more important for the
    sound to be continuous. A reel of film might run for 11
    minutes, so a rotational speed of about 32 rpm was required
    to make the sound match the picture. History doesn't tell us
    why precisely 33 1/3 was chosen, but in retrospect it was a
    very good choice because stroboscopic speed testers can be
    made for this speed which will work on both sides of the
    Atlantic. 

    It seems CBS engineers (who developed the first LPs in
    1948), simply experimented with one of the old machines
    hanging around in their workshop. They then developed new
    groove dimensions which gave an acceptable signal-to-noise
    ratio with the new plastic material "vinyl". 

    The 45 rpm speed was the only one to be decided by a precise
    optimisation procedure (by RCA Victor in 1948). Calculus was
    used to show that the optimum use of a disc record of
    constant rotational speed occurs when the innermost recorded
    diameter is half the outermost recorded diameter. That's why
    a 7-inch single has a label 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Given
    the CBS vinyl groove dimensions and certain assumptions
    about the bandwidth and tolerable distortion, a speed of 45
    rpm comes out of the formula. 

    PETER COPELAND
    British Library National Sound Archive 
    London 


    a. From 1894 to around 1930, there were many different
    record speeds ranging from 65 to 90 rpm, each case being a
    compromise between playing time and the need for a clean cut
    in the original wax. The Victor company used 76 rpm for many
    years for its recordings but instructed buyers to reproduce
    at 78 rpm, the record's durability was improved that way.
    The standard of 78 rpm arrived by default, although the
    actual speed depended on the electrical mains frequency.
    Constant linear speed, or varying the rpm, was
    commercialised but did not prove to be a success (until the
    arrival of the CD). 

    The speed of 33 1/3 was introduced in 1927 after theoretical
    analysis of the compromise between signal-to-noise ratio and
    playing time (3 minutes per radial inch) by J. P. Maxfield
    of Bell Laboratories for sound films produced on the
    Vitaphone system. And it was a professional de facto
    standard before it became commercialised by CBS in 1948. It
    has been suggested that 78 minus 33 equals 45 was the reason
    for the emergence of 45 rpm records but, in fact, Maxfield's
    analysis still applies: the 45 "single" was RCA's equivalent
    to a 10-inch, 78 rpm record, only smaller. 

    GEORGE BROCK-NANNESTAD
    Copenhagen 
    Denmark 


    a. Emil Berliner's first disc gramophones were wound by hand
    at somewhere between 60 and 100 rpm. The 7-inch discs lasted
    a minute or so and had low sound quality. Berliner and his
    assistant Fred Gaisberg realised that unless the speed was
    governed, the gramophone would never be more than a novelty.
    Gaisberg visited a young mechanic who was making clockwork
    machinery, hoping to use it for sewing machines. This
    machinery was never successful in sewing machines, but was
    ideal for gramophones, and it rotated at 78 rpm. The
    mechanic, Eldridge Johnson, became a millionaire. Columbia
    made all its discs to run at 80 and HMV had its pioneer
    recordings produced between 68 and 92 rpm with the key of
    the piece marked on the label. You then tuned it on your own
    piano, using the gramophone's governor. These speeds all
    gradually settled into the standard of 78. 

    When talking pictures first arrived in the late 1920s, the
    sound was recorded separated on discs and had to be
    synchronised by the projectionist at each showing. Every
    cinema projection room had a pair of projectors, each taking
    1000-feet reels of film, whose running time was about 10
    minutes. The projectionist switched projectors after each
    reel. Ideally, this meant that the sound should last 10
    minutes as well, as it would be impossible to synchronise a
    sound changeover in midreel. At the time, however, a 12 inch
    78 rpm record lasted for only about 4 minutes, so the
    Vitagraph company simply slowed down the 78 until it lasted
    10 minutes and recorded all their masters on that, starting
    each disc in the middle, as it was easier to drop a needle
    there than the outer edge. This new speed was 33 1/3 rpm,
    adopted for other records in the late 1940s when Columbia
    introduced its first vinyl, long-play discs with
    microgrooves, giving a play time of about 30 minutes on each
    side. 

    However, the long-play disc wasn't particularly suitable to
    popular music, as the public wanted its records as singles
    with good sound quality even at high volumes. RCA Victor
    came up with a 7-inch vinyl disc with microgrooves, rotating
    at 45 rpm, a speed chosen specifically to make the most of
    the music, unlike 78s or 33 1/3s. And does no one remember
    the 16s?

I dunno...I have seen some people be truly un-selective about whom they 
fuck. About the only selection there was boiled down to "the other person is 
willing to hump me, so I'm going for it". If that's not ebing fairly random, 
I dunno what is.

"Truly" random....this is an issue of semantics.

Once you start comparing sex to consumer transactions, you ought to 
reevaluate your quality of life. But then again, since you admittidedly sell 
your own ass, you probably wouldn't understand what I was talking about 
anyway. Don't get me wrong...not knocking what you do. It takes all sorts of 
people to make the world go around. I'm just saying it takes a completely 
different mindset to operate on that level. I'm sure you'd agree....

Now, the fact that you'd fuck Pamela Anderson (who not only is FOUL, but has 
been diagnosed with an agressive strain of Hepatitis C) TRULY scares me. 
This is what I mean by being selective, and not fucking people at random. 
Unless of course you don't mind sleeping with dirty, diseased skanks....lol.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: On being a slut

Is it just me, or is this discussion completely worthless and devoid of any 
substance?  Obviously, people don't agree on the definition of the word 
slut.  It's pretty obnoxious when people argue about frivolous things just 
to hear themselves argue.  I'm not sure if there is some vague, masked 
insecurity that people are trying to cover up by arguing over each other.  
But this discussion started out pretty worthless and it hasn't really gained 
any merit.  Boring, obnoxious, and ridiculous... yeah, that's it.

Subject: [sfraves]Christian Rave/Music Scene

I have recently been dabbling in the concept of religion, and speaking to 
people close to me.  I know this cool kat, he was really involved in the 
scene in the early 90's.  He spoke of the full moon parties and love affair 
parties and so on.  He is trying to find a medium between the rave scene and 
christianity.  While I think this is awesome, I think it would be a hard 
thing to accomplish, because I love swiggin on my hennessy and smokin on me 
smoke when Im gettn down.  He said I would be surprised how many christians 
do indulge in chronic or alcohol in moderation.  He had me listen to some 
hiphop and downtempo that was made by christians...  I was like, DAMN!  
These christian cats got flows!!  They weren't even flowing about jesus, the 
bible, or anything, they were flowin about what underground hiphop heads be 
flowin about.

I had this impression of what christian musician's would be like, and I was 
totally wrong!  Although, I am just at the tip of the iceberg, I would like 
to hear from you people about your understanding of christianity, music and 
the rave scene.  Or not even christianity, just spirituality in general.

peace

My friend Graham St. John, who has edited several works on rave culture, 
has just published a book that addresses this very topic.  He is also doing 
a followup work on the same subject and I'm slated to contribute an 
essay.  Info:

Rave Culture and Religion
(London, New York: Routledge 2004)

Vast numbers of western youth have attached primary significance to raving 
and post-rave experiences. This collection of essays explores the 
socio-cultural and religious dimensions of the rave, 'raving' and 
rave-derived phenomena.

Rave Culture and Religion provides insights on developments in 
post-traditional religiosity (especially 'New Age' and 'Neo-Paganism') 
through studies of rave's Gnostic narratives of ascensionism and 
re-enchantment, explorations of the embodied spirituality and millennialist 
predispositions of dance culture, and investigations of transnational 
digital-art countercultures manifesting at geographic locations as diverse 
as Goa, India, and Nevada's Burning Man festival. Contributors examine 
raving as a new religious or revitalization movement; a powerful locus of 
sacrifice and transgression; a lived bodily experience; a practice 
comparable with world entheogenic rituals; and as evidencing a new 
Orientalism. Rave Culture and Religion will be essential reading for 
advanced students and academics in the fields of sociology, cultural 
studies and religious studies.

Hey I have noticed this as well, some posts take days, yes days to hit this list, others are
instant...Any ideas? I am sure one of the higher-ups in the top floor offices can shed some light
onto this.

That's less obnoxious than people that post emails, only to trod on 
others?  What is the point of YOUR email?  Can you do nothing but complain?

I happen to be very interested in linguistics and etymology, and I will 
argue when someone posts some dumb shit that isn't true.  Overall, everyone 
in the thread has more or less agreed to similar definitions of slut, 
except Starchild.  Obviously, people do agree, but a minority wishes it 
wasn't derogatory.

	It's just you.  ;)

	No, seriously -- how is a discussion of attitudes regarding sexual 
relations between human beings more trivial than an argument over, for 
example, which headphones are superior or which DJ spins a better set? 
Which topic has more significance for our lives on earth as human 
beings?

	Surely this discussion has more relevance for the entire SFR community 
than the question of what advice to give Joey Frisco in regards to one 
particular girl he likes -- something that your friends who know you 
well would be in a better position to do than a bunch of relative 
strangers on a mailing list?

It's a 48kbps input, so it's not the best.  But it works :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Christian Rave/Music Scene

Some people sing about the girl//boy they love while others since about how
much they love god. Take any contemporary form of popular music and change
the lyrics to a religious theme and there ya go. This is why you see those
mega-massive christian prayer fests full of kids. Christian music has taken
the same marketing spin used to create boy bands and applied it to their
section of music.

What disturbs me more is the concept of a denomanational based rave. Give
that the whole point of raving was to express your freedom and make the
event what you want it to be I see something like religion going against
that ideal. Spirituality is what you make of it for yourself. When it comes
to events - you can have a christian god like experience or something more
zen buddhist. But the fact remains that parties aren't thrown under any
religious guise because at that point your freedom to make that event what
you want is already clouded.

I'm very much against religion being brought into events. Much like
seperation of church and state I feel there is a line that shouldn't be
crossed either. We all carry our own sense of spirituality with us. To each
their own and their freedom to experience a party without an organized
religious theme.

Subject: [sfraves]Christian Rave/Music Scene


I have recently been dabbling in the concept of religion, and speaking to
people close to me.  I know this cool kat, he was really involved in the
scene in the early 90's.  He spoke of the full moon parties and love affair
parties and so on.  He is trying to find a medium between the rave scene and
christianity.  While I think this is awesome, I think it would be a hard
thing to accomplish, because I love swiggin on my hennessy and smokin on me
smoke when Im gettn down.  He said I would be surprised how many christians
do indulge in chronic or alcohol in moderation.  He had me listen to some
hiphop and downtempo that was made by christians...  I was like, DAMN!
These christian cats got flows!!  They weren't even flowing about jesus, the
bible, or anything, they were flowin about what underground hiphop heads be
flowin about.

I had this impression of what christian musician's would be like, and I was
totally wrong!  Although, I am just at the tip of the iceberg, I would like
to hear from you people about your understanding of christianity, music and
the rave scene.  Or not even christianity, just spirituality in general.

peace

"We all carry our own sense of spirituality with us. To each their own and 
their freedom to experience a party without an organized religious theme."

I totally agree with you.  I am new to this whole, 'spiritual music scene'.  
I thought it was interesting so I am trying to find out more.  I totally 
think a party or a rave should have a mix of every and any type of spiritual 
bodies, or un-spiritual bodies.  Spirituality shouldn't be the basis of 
music either, unless your feeling that topic at the time.  A christian 
friend of mine was saying that there are two types of christian music, one 
where they compose songs soley about god and christianity, and others where 
they speak about whatever they want, but they are christians.  The music 
that I liked was where they talked about whatever they wanted.  I think that 
artists who are openly christian get categorized into the christian music 
category simply because of their religion.  There are some sick artists out 
there, who you would never guess are categorized as christian music....

I dunno.  I can't imagine myself gettin down at a christian rave, simply 
because I wouldn't be able to have a pint of hennessy in my back pocket, but 
I'm willing to check it out.  It's all new to me!

fable....

ps...apologies for my rambling ; )

I get the distinct impression that Ryan has been watching South Park 
recently ;)

(not that his point is any less valid...nay, in fact, it's very valid!)

Although, one of the best parties I attended was called "WWJD?" (aka What 
Would Jesus Do?)...but it was all in the spirit of sarcasm amongst ravers at 
Xmas time...not a religion based event.

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Christian Rave/Music Scene

When I was in Santa Fe last month, the only station that my hotel 
clock/radio could pick up was some Christian station, so I'd wake up 
to, er, "inspirational" music each A.M.  Believe me, it inspired me to 
get the hell out of bed and into the shower quite well!

One morning, though, I woke up to the same station playing some great 
EDM I hadn't heard before.  It was a bit trancey and had that whole 
"uplifiting" vibe (which I generally don't go for) but I have to say, 
it was some great wake-up music. Turns out it was some of the new stuff 
from a rising "club scene" within the religious music biz...

My first reaction to stuff like this is to ridicule it, etc. as some 
contrived way to recruit more youngin's into the church. But honestly, 
like the whole separation-of-Church-and-State thing brought up earlier, 
I don't think it matters where the music comes from or how its inspired 
- in the end, if it's good, enjoyable music (and you can dance to it!) 
then there's no reason not to listen to it.  Hell, it made my morning!

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Christian Rave/Music Scene

"...others where
they speak about whatever they want, but they are christians.  The music
that I liked was where they talked about whatever they wanted."

That's basically what all music is. Is Beck Jewish folk-rock-fusion music
just because he happens to be Jewish? I think when you're of a certain
faith, but your music doesn't blatantly reflect that faith it's just *music*
and nothing more. That same thing could be said about parties. You could
have a bunch of christian faith based kids throwing events, but that's not a
christian rave. It's when the group throwing the party imposes that
religious theme upon the attendees and themes the party in a religious
manner that an element of spiritual freedom is lost.

All I can say is any event I'm involved with will never, *never* be tainted
by a religious overtone. It's all about what you make of it and want it to
be spiritually for yourself.

"We all carry our own sense of spirituality with us. To each their own and

I totally agree with you.  I am new to this whole, 'spiritual music scene'.
I thought it was interesting so I am trying to find out more.  I totally
think a party or a rave should have a mix of every and any type of spiritual
bodies, or un-spiritual bodies.  Spirituality shouldn't be the basis of
music either, unless your feeling that topic at the time.  A christian
friend of mine was saying that there are two types of christian music, one
where they compose songs soley about god and christianity, and others where
they speak about whatever they want, but they are christians.  The music
that I liked was where they talked about whatever they wanted.  I think that
artists who are openly christian get categorized into the christian music
category simply because of their religion.  There are some sick artists out
there, who you would never guess are categorized as christian music....

I dunno.  I can't imagine myself gettin down at a christian rave, simply
because I wouldn't be able to have a pint of hennessy in my back pocket, but
I'm willing to check it out.  It's all new to me!

fable....

I did happen to catch the mormon episode this week. That was some damn funny
shit. I loved how they trivialized the beliefs but then countered the
bashing with that kids comment at the end. *Look I may not believe in all of
that stuff but what I do know is I have a great family and a great life. All
I wanted was for you to be my friend but since you can't look past my
religion - suck my balls!*

I get the distinct impression that Ryan has been watching South Park
recently ;)

(not that his point is any less valid...nay, in fact, it's very valid!)

Although, one of the best parties I attended was called "WWJD?" (aka What
Would Jesus Do?)...but it was all in the spirit of sarcasm amongst ravers at
Xmas time...not a religion based event.

Wish I had more time to add value to this thread, but I'm working on 
another event tonight --  Leslie Ayres' birthday party.  Happy Birthday 
Leslie!!!

I personally have problems with any organized religion these days.  Most of 
my life I saw myself as an atheist or, at best, agnostic.  These days I 
have become much interested in "pagan" tribal experience in the context of 
music and dance: call this trance dancing;  experience of the "other" 
through group dance; or some sort of transcendent knowledge that some might 
define as "religious."   Ancient stuff.

This experience is available, I think, through various organized religious 
disciplines.  Raves, or communal dance in general, can be a valuable tool 
in the personal quest for self-knowledge, development of empathy for 
others, and achievement of some harmony with the rhythms of the universe 
around us.

Love,

Apollo

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"It is not the same to talk of the bulls as to be in the bullring."
-Spanish Proverb

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Well said- what's next?

Why not take things to a racial level?
Some would say that taking things to such extreme
levels to prove the point is a logical fallacy, but
it's still against the very principle.

I would agree...I was raised as a Catholic, which "cured me" of getting 
involved with any contemporary organized religion. However, as of late, I've 
been delving into the ancient Egyptian culture, and finding some interesting 
things about their "religion" which wasn't quite what it is made out to be. 
Their whole culture was one living, breathing entity. Religion wasn't just 
religion, it was art, music, philosophy, etc., as was the case for their 
architecture, art, music, way of life...etc. Everything was inter-related. 
It was simultaneously spiritual and mundane. Everything and everyone were 
very "in tune" with everything else and everyone else. They used 
hallucinogens and other intoxicants to expand their consciousness, as well 
as used ritual to commune with each other and their "gods". This might 
explain why their civilisation was so far advanced. Either way, they weren't 
the barbarous people most academia makes them out to be.....

"Openly christian" hahah-
Why not just call it music?
Does it really matter whether the drummer praises
Jesus or prays to a rock?

I don't know why you would think that-
Are you saying that "christians" don't drink?

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Christian Rave/Music Scene

""Openly christian" hahah-Why not just call it music?  Does it really matter 
whether the drummer praises Jesus or prays to a rock?"

I was wondering the same thing.  I was told that the christian music 
industry is financially above even mainstream music.  So those who dont 
advertise religion in their music may just want that financial backing?  Im 
unsure tho, as I said, this is all new to me.  Im not condoning christian 
music, Im just trying to find out more about it, because I heard some pretty 
good stuff.

"I don't know why you would think that-Are you saying that "christians" 
don't drink?"

Naw, Im not saying christians dont drink.  Im just wondering what everyone 
would think if I was gettin down at some christian event while periodically 
taking a fat swig from my henessy flask...

It might matter if that drummer forces the issue enough so that there
are only 6 videos available to view on the tourbus and they're all ones
that his Born Again Christian religious self approves of, no?  Don't you
think Lenny and the rest of the band might be slightly influenced?

Subject: [sfraves] BAD KITTY Last night =) How Dope!

ok... so like after class... i was soooooo planning on goin' home lastnight after class, but my class mate Toph asked me if I needed a ride somewhere & impulsively I said Mission & 6th... LoL... so I end up @ POW & the Jungle night that stopped a few weeks ago starterd again... it was Awesome... but I didn't go in...

So I walked over 2 Bad Kitty & right away I saw Seraphim lookin' Sharp in this dull red light that was shinning from above her, electro clash was playing in the back ground... la la la... naw.. but it was Groovy seein' her again & wee always have alot 2 talk about when we C each other as of lately!

BUt it was CooL 'cause the happy Hour DJ was still spinning this eclectic mixture of beats ranging from 80's music 2 House 2 Electro... yeah... it could probably be comparable 2 an AndyW set... LoL... jk...

Then Seraphim went on & totally started off spinning The Go-Go's "We Got The Beat" & ooooooh.. she totally went 80's,,,,, yummy! Although I couldn't stay 2 long & the last song I did stay 4 was "Don't You Want Me Baby" by Human League... I mean.. I was there 4 like 1/2 hr more or less, but man.. it was still fun there!!  I mean... I meet the Grooviest people when I'm there & Hello 2Day... my Favorite BAr Tender is back from Vacation *MoHa"...

I mean.. really... this place is jus' so fun 2 kick it on a Thursday night... what's even more Groovy is that there's art on the walls that'4 sale!!!  Man... if I ever get enough money while that painting I want is still on sale... hmmmm... I may get it!!

I mean like, I could tell that the fun jus' totally started jus' as I wa like about 2 leave... but ya know.. .bart sucks... Hello 2Day...

BUt I still had a fun time!

Speaking of cat's, is it still possible 4 cats 2 still have sex even after they're fixed?  I coulda sworn I heard my cat having sex lastnight in the bushes... I mean... I know that's a mondo lame question... but ya know... I seriously have 2 know if they will be any harm from it 'cause ya know... Pheobe's fixed & she's hmmmm... she's like me... she's confused alot!  LoL


Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

when i've really looked or listened or overheard, not one society on 
the planet is exempt from allowing some form of barbarism ... or 
allowed it to take over their society; one example would be the mayans 
inviting in the toltecs, turning the mayan civilization from a peaceful 
(that we think we know is) into one that made human sacrifices like the 
later formed aztecs.

Subject: [sfraves] 39/smooth re-release :) [was On being a slut]

relevance beyond the sfr community.  thank you for all the various points
of view.  definitely fodder for thought.   :)

(whatever you do, please respect each other :)

big helloooooo to Van Mundegaarde!  miss ya on this coast!

"39/smooth"?

your new neck o' the woods!  woot!

respectfully,
mary :)

             It's just you.  ;)

             No, seriously -- how is a discussion of attitudes regarding
sexual
relations between human beings more trivial than an argument over, for
example, which headphones are superior or which DJ spins a better set?
Which topic has more significance for our lives on earth as human
beings?

             Surely this discussion has more relevance for the entire SFR
community
than the question of what advice to give Joey Frisco in regards to one
particular girl he likes -- something that your friends who know you
well would be in a better position to do than a bunch of relative
strangers on a mailing list?

Yes, it's possible for cats to continue scrogging after they get fixed. My

That common misperception of Egyptian culture was abandoned quite a few 
years ago ;)

Yes, they most likely had slaves, but not nearly the ammount that was 
previously thought, nor were they forced to build ANYTHING as is the biggest 
misconception (all building of structures was run like any modern day 
national project, with hired, skilled, PAID laborers). They also had say in 
politics, etc.
"Slaves" in Egypt were more often than not, assimilated peoples of conquered 
nations....

    I realized that it's been a long time since I've posted to SFR when =
it wasn't a BSP about a party I was throwing or helping with. I wanted =
to take the time to say thank you to SFRaves and to the rave community =
in general. It was only about 2 1/2 years ago that I discovered that I =
am a raver, and my life has improved dramatically in that time as I have =
grown into the person that I am now. I'd like to thank every stranger at =
a party who didn't care about my color, my age or my job, and who talked =
to me as person. I've gotten a lot of love out of this scene, and I try =
to give it back whenever I can. Thank you all, and keep on dancing!

Love,

Happy :-)

Subject: [sfraves] Godskitchen venue is off the hook!

We just returned from the Avalon Ballroom for a bite to eat. All I can say
is.....

Gianni, the Avalon and Godskitchen have done an AMAZING thing to this
venue!!

Can we say ALICE IN WONDERLAND???????????? This night is going to be off the
hook! They've been working on the production since last night after driving
the the Godskitchen truck from Vegas for a long 10 hour drive!

I hope that everyone can make it down for this event! Everything is top
notch! The props, the laser, the lighting, the whole feel of the place. When
we walked in, we felt like we had stepped back into the Renaissance period!

The venue is at the corner of Van Ness and Sutter in the City, and the event
begins at 7pm tonight! If you're 18 or older, then it's on for you. They've
got bars upstairs for the 21+. The info line is at 415.820.3904. You can
check out the online info at http://www.mostwantedna.com/gk.

See you tonight!! Fergie is going to be awesome! :) MODA

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Christian Rave/Music Scene

I think the point missed here is that Christians aren't seeking to create 
TAZ's open to everyone to express their freedoms.  They're partying with 
their God in a new way - one which follows modern music trends.  I applaud 
it.  Make it Racial.. make it religion based, whatever, it's still logical 
that people that cling to an ideology can want to celebrate, by 
themselves.  Do you think Mason's and Moose Lodge members don't throw 
private parties, that conform to their ideals?  What it be any different if 
they decided to throw an event with electronic music instead?

was at a nice little party, 'round folsom & 7.. not very big.. but nice
people & good thumping deejays.. had a fun time, & was feeling tired...
was about to go home, when i discovered some dirty rotten mohfoh had
stolen my coat.  you know, is not biig del, just some thrifstore stuff,
but it's *fuckin' cold* out... so i walked home in the cold.. but
fortunately the coat is aa little unusual looking, so if i see some
fuckah wearing it, i'm gonna have to punch him in the nose, no questions
asked..

Subject: [sfraves] Old XLR8R magazines for sale

 


I was cleaning out the garage today and found a box full of old XLR8R
magazines from way back.

I have issues 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26 with many
doubles


If anybody is interested I'll sell the lot for $20

Subject: [sfraves] Over the Top?

A little undeegroond lurking under everyone's noses in SF. MAD respect,
guys. I'm way too tired to write a review, but I gotta say: the MCs?
Badass. Music? Wicked -- especially the people that started throwing down
darker shit at the end of the night. Mad props to Level Hopper and ILL for
throwing the right kinda party. I haven't had that much fun in a while. :)

Now to totter my sore bottom to bedsies.

hello, this is your on-line crystal ball with your reading on this most joyous saturday..."as the depths of winter approach, so does depth of feeling...seasonal celebrations are simply reminders of what 
you already know..be relieved that there is relief to be had, or that none is required..know that when you have an audience, you are not owned by eyes, but that your experience is yours alone or with 
whom you choose alone, or really, just be alone together...there is nothing to ignore in inactivity..there is only nature...avoid what is fertile if you do not wish to create.."...more later...:)

Subject: [sfraves] Mayans (was Re: Christian Rave/Music Scene)

	Hmm... when I was in Mexico looking at Mayan ruins earlier this year, 
I read a number of pamphlets and exhibits and such about Mayan history 
and culture. There was ample material illustrating the warlike and 
barbaric (i.e. bloody) nature of that society, but nothing (at least 
that I remember) suggesting that the Toltecs were responsible for these 
qualities, or that the Mayans were originally peaceful. They did build 
some impressive temples though! I was most impressed by the beauty of 
the ruins at Palenque. There's also a local culture in that area of 
taking hallucinogenic mushrooms, which grow thereabouts.

Groove on,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mayans (was Re: Christian Rave/Music Scene)

when i visited chichen itza in 2000, the local tour guide showed us the 
part that was built before the toltecs moved in from the north and 
merged, or more or less took over their culture.  before they came, 
there was merely a few buildings and an astronomical observatory, which 
is one of the oldest buildings.  after the merging, which is symbolized 
by the pillars in the temple of the warriors, is when he said people 
were sacrificed into the natural wells that are all around the area.  
probably not as brutal as what the aztecs did, but it's a start.

btw, i've never been to palenque, but el castillo at chichen itza is 
amazing if you climb to the top; it's obvious that some of the footage 
from the original star wars movie was filmed down at one of these 
temples, namely the scene where the millenium falcon flies into the 
rebel base on the moon where they make their stand off with the death 
star.

What's up guys and gals!  Tonight is Sunday, and therefore Dirtbox Radio
will be taking to the muffuckin airwaves!

Tonight marks the first in what'll hopefully be a long tradition of

didn't know, Destroyer's doin their thing here in DC, and we're glad to
team up wif 'em.

The guest DJs for tonight will be DJ Kauz and the one like Mugzy.  Kauz is
one of our boys, he's done his thing with the Deez Beatz parties in
Bethesda, and hosts a show of his own, every Friday from 8-11pm (CST) on
Midwest DNB's netcast station.  Hit up www.mw-dnb.com for more info, yo.
Syncopation crew's own Mugzy will be with us as well tonight.  Mugzy rips
decks like a champ, and throws a couple phat ass parties in the Baltimore
area, Staccato & Syncopation (one of my favorite joints).  Staccato runs
every tuesday @ the Mojo Lounge in Balmer, and Syncopation should be back
with us soon at a new location 'round the Towson area.  So yeah, both are
tight cats and put in work, so y'all tune in and catch 'em live tonight.

For audio links, webcam, and chatroom, just point your browser towards

Tonight's lineup is as follows:
07-08pm EST - Intro Jammy wif ODJ & Jerel
08-09:30pm EST - Mugzy *

up-to-the-motherfuckin-minute updates.

Big shout out to Destroyer for havin' us, only good things to come...

... and if you're in the area and not listening to Dirtbox, get your ass
over to Seventh Day Soul @ South Beach in Bethesda for some hot Sunday
night jams.

Easy,
Jackson

I just came across this. . .

It so sucks to be sick with something that absolutely no one knows about
or believes. Thus no research, no remedies, no doctors, no help. . .

I feel for em. . . could you imagine how much faith and will it would
take to go thru some unimaginable illness day after day and all you have
to look forward to is for somehow something happens that makes you
better, even tho that was basically all on you. . . cuz dumbass doctors
are so closed minded. They're pretty strong people to deal with all the
various issues surrounding something like that. Like the way they feel
about themselves, the way others look at them, not to mention the pain,
discomfort, etc they constantly deal with.

            Hopefully the news article will bring some attention to it.

 

Take care all

"Mystery Skin Disease in Daly City"
 


  

Westlake residents complain of mystery disease 

By Kate Williamson
Of The Examiner Staff
kwilliamson@examiner.com
Published on Monday, November 17, 2003 

DALY CITY -- Some residents of Westlake Village Apartments have
complained to the county that they have a mysterious skin infection, but
feel they are left on their own in coping with the outbreak. 
Following the notification to the San Mateo County Health Services
Agency, county officials recently ordered the complex to seal up holes
that may allow rodents into the units. But it is unclear if that will
combat the infection, or even if the mice and rats are responsible. 
Residents of four apartments at 205 Palmcrest Drive interviewed for this
article feared to be named, suspecting reprisal. They reported -- and in
some cases, showed -- an ongoing skin condition. 
Primarily non-English speakers, the residents said their landlord and
officials have cast them adrift. 
"This thing started in December of last year," said one father of two
young girls, all of whom have been infected. 
Under his armpit, he displayed a wound near a rash, the afterimage of a
golf-ball-size boil that was cut open and drained of liquid at an
emergency room Nov. 9. 
The boils start out smaller, as spots that resemble bug bites at the
center of a pale, discolored ring, he said. His two young daughters and
his wife both had the marks Nov. 11. Those bites grow until they are
filled with pus and the victim develops a fever, he said. He has had to
stay home from work with the illness, making it difficult for him to
work enough to afford the family's rent. 
Cutting the boils open is the only thing that cures them, he said. He
was told he developed a bacterial infection because he is a hairy man,
but he does not know how his smooth-skinned girls could also have the
problem, he said 
"I passed every test. I don't have nothing," he said. 
Research on several medical Web sites revealed that the symptoms are
similar to furuncles, or boils, caused by bacteria or fungal infection
and can be linked to diabetes. 
Residents in two other apartments also told The Examiner they had
contracted the infection. 
The San Mateo County Health Services Agency was alerted to the infection
at the complex in October, said agency representative Beverly Thames. 
The nurses spoke with a doctor who treated one of the residents and
determined the infection was not a "reportable" communicable disease. 
"I would love it if one of the docs would evaluate them and, if they
feel there's a significant problem, do a culture," said county public
health doctor Sam Stebbins. "We need that information from the
practitioners." 
Stebbins recommended that anyone afflicted with the boils come to the
North County Health Center in Daly City. Emergency rooms tend to be
harried, Stebbins said. He added that contagious bacterial infections
are rare, relying as they do on skin-to-skin contact. 
"We haven't closed the book on it," he said. 
Some residents fear their infection is related to the ongoing rodent
problem in the building, saying they did not have the disease before a
particularly bad mouse infestation earlier this year. 
The county environmental health division inspected the property Oct. 23.
They found one dead rat mite and a live one in two apartments, but they
are not likely to be connected to the illness. 
The residents' symptoms are inconsistent with mite or fleabites, said
Environmental Services Director Dean Peterson. 
"Rarely is a bite going to cause a bacterial infection unless you
scratch it and open it," he said. 
"The only time anything was done was when the health department came and
the building inspector came," said one woman. 
A Westlake representative did not return calls by press time. 
With nobody taking responsibility to coordinate tackling the infection,
residents remain frustrated. 
"We are looking for somebody to help us," said the man with the cut
beneath his arm.

oh my god, i use to live in westlake village, but i was on poincetta, not 
palmcrest. my only complaint while i was there was that my ONLY WINDOW faced 
into a giant gaping hole in the middle of the building, as did many other 
peoples windows, sucked when someone made a lot of noise. i don't ever recall 
skin problems, however, save my already dry skin.

How much did you pay for them???

if they are some of the firsts if my memory serves me correctly they were 
FREE!!  I think just in the last few years they actually started charging 
for the mag.

Like Andy pointed out sell them at what you paid or better yet offer a 
barter system!  :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: Mystery Skin Disease in Daly City

there has been a similar health epidemic in san
francisco, for a year or so.  the health dept knows
about it, it has been linked to poor hygiene, weak
immune systems, drug use, malnutrition, and similar
conditions.
it's an abscess of staph infection in most cases, is
extremely painful, and can be very dangerous depending
on location of infection and time left untreated.  it
is similar to flesh eating bacteria.  they keep
sweeping it under the rug because they assume its the
poor and the drug users.  that's often not the case.
it has been through the gay community, the dance
community, drug community, low income, ....
doctors don't know what to do with it, except
prescribe a massive dose of super antibiotics, blaming
the abscesses on 'highly evolved strains of staph'. 
most often it's misdiagnosed or left untreated at
first, because doctors can't narrow down the exact
cause.  the center for disease control is monitoring
it closely, but can't pin it down. many cases were 
supposedly related to meth use, putting 'dirty' street
drugs into an already weakened system from drug use.
everyone carries staph in and on them, but it is
opportunistic to weak systems, and more mutated
strains can be passed on by shared drug paraphenalia
and/or physical contact.
thanks for posting that info, people need to be aware
of what's out there...

Subject: [sfraves] RR: AMNESIA review (11.22.03)

Rolled on down to AMNESIA to catch a little mo' breakbeat goodness on 
Saturday night.

1st off, I like small places, and love breaks, so this (monthly?) shindig is 
a godsend to me. The only thing that could improve it, is if they served 
actual liquor, and not just beer. Thank god for the $3 shots of Underberg 
(or whatever it's called...Jaegermeisters beefy cousin). Either there was 
some sort of special going on, or the bartenders were just being fucking 
cool, cuz I didn't pay more than $4 for a pint all night, and I had a few 
pricier beverages.

Now on to the tunes...

Once again Donna Matrix kept the flow going all night. She started off a 
littlle of the slower side of things, but when she got back on the decks 
later in the night, she straight ripped it!! There was one other cat on the 
bill that impressed me quite a bit this time around...his name is Alexander 
(that's all I caught), and he seems to stick more to the Freq Nasty, 
breakstep, ragga kinda sound. It's done very well though. High energy 
through and through.

The other two dj's seemed to be having problems either with the mixer, or 
with the setup in general. They didn't play poorly really, but there were 
some "let's just flick the fader over here and hope no one notices" mixes 
going on.

All in all, I had a fucking blast. Heard great tunes, drank good beers, and 
relaxed.

Looking forward to the next one.....

Sarah Burton, Resonance

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"It is not the same to talk of the bulls as to be in the bullring."
-Spanish Proverb

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves]nrr: DJs: Turntable LEDs

What are your thoughts on LED modifications on Technics?  I know everyone 
and their mother wants to change them to blue.  I kinda like the stock 
lighting.  I was just wondering what crazy mods you have seen done to 
tables, what *you* have done, and what you would like to have done.  I think 
it would be cool to change all the LEDs to a bright white color.

I modded my tables with oil slick and smokescreen defense systems. 
Trouble is, regardless of what record I put on them, the only tune that
comes out of the speakers is the Theme from Peter Gunn.

well, thirsty bear thirsdays (featuring the ambient mafia and

thanksgiving.

but we'll be back next week with more housey goodness - andrew
phelan is back, and is going to tear the place a new asshole.

that's pretty important.  not every day you get a new asshole
torn...

hello, this is your on-line crystal ball with your reading for the day..."welp, it is just before the holiday where lots of people just toooooooooooootally overeat..now, there is popcorn, and then is 
stale popcorn...(sp? stale? old and chewy)...some folks don't know the difference between the two...heck, you can cop a living off of that, but then, maybe you'd be the type to also wear a baseball cap with straws in it so you can drink two beers at a time in an old chair...not for fun, but just because it is a lifestyle choice..."...more later...:)

Subject: RE: [sfraves]nrr: DJs: Turntable LEDs

Hey whutup

You can get pretty sick lil led sets from a lot of of auto perf dealers
on ebay. . .theres a lot of diff colors, and the "spot light" kind of
effect for interior sets and all might be an improvement too. 
You can get them from like less than a dollar for just a hyperwhite led,
to like 10-$40 for a lil interior kit or something like that. 

You could probably get diff shades of blue, purple, yellow, hyperwhite,
red, I think some guys also have like hyperblue n all. . 

Itd be cool to install a couple under the platter too. . . thatd be a
groovy effect. . .

Subject: [sfraves]nrr: DJs: Turntable LEDs

What are your thoughts on LED modifications on Technics?  I know
everyone 
and their mother wants to change them to blue.  I kinda like the stock 
lighting.  I was just wondering what crazy mods you have seen done to 
tables, what *you* have done, and what you would like to have done.  I
think 
it would be cool to change all the LEDs to a bright white color.

I will have to jump in and say that Don is a great guy and knows what he's
doing. If you're not comfortable modifying your rather expensive equipment I
suggest you let Don handle that for you. A lot less headache and you know
your beloved gear is going to come back to you in working order. =)

On the LED topic if you're really saavy you could use the RGB led's and with
a simple controller be able to have 256 colors selectable. That's how those
color change car decks work... There are also true UV (blacklight) LEDs but
they aren't cheap. About $20/ea. I'm going to be installing them in a car
application for instrumentation illumination for the needles. Why - just
because I'm an electronics geek.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Sound and colored lights really seem to go together. I don't have a 1200 to 
modify with colored LEDs, but I have a computer with four colors of LEDs and 
built-in blacklights. The entire case is blacklight-sensitive green plastic, and 
it glows from the lights inside as well as from external blacklights in my 
room. 

It has two types of blacklight-sensitive cables. One has the same purplish 
glow as the little collars around water bottles -- have you noticed how bright 
those are under UV light? The other cables glow greenish-white under blacklight 
and continue to glow when the blacklights are turned off. 

It's a raver computer because, in addition to the lights, it's: owned by a 
raver, built by (another) raver, and it's used to process digital photos of 
raves. It even serves to light up my room with blacklight when I want a certain 
mood. I use it for listening to music and watching DVDs (just got the DVD of 
Happy 2B Hardcore -- very fun visuals). 

Modifying and customizing things is fun. By using a few components from my 
old computer, and buying new parts on sale at Fry's, I got quite a powerful 
computer at an excellent price -- less than half the price of a new system. Best 
of all, it's unique!  

If anybody wants to see a picture, let me know, and also if you'd like to 
contact Alex, who put my computer together, because he's very good at building, 
modifying, and fixing computers.
Have a Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

Subject: [sfraves] RR: D&B vinyl up on eBay!!!!

I'm getting rid of my D&B collection, and most of it is up on eBay right 
now. There's one more lot getting posted in the next few days. Some have 
reserve's, some don't. Almost everything posted is classic, hard to find, or 
old as shit. Prices are set accordingly. If anyone from the area is 
interested, or bids and wins, I will either reduce shipping costs, or hold 
them for you to pick up (no shipping charge - obviously!).

Here's the link...happy bidding!!!

http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewSellersOtherItems&userid=starlightjen&include=0&since=-1&sort=3&rows=50


(If the link doesn't work, put in a search for the seller i.d. 
"starlightjen")

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr: Mystery Skin Disease in Daly City

Heya, 

Yeah mann, thanks for your info. . .like you know that saying uhh,
whatchamacallit, like "ignorance is bliss". ..  
Really, if most people knew even a lil about disorders like that (which
are more or less unknown and kept quiet) they would go thru every day of
their life feeling they were nuts cuz they had to "sanitize" everything
in their home, clean door handles before they open them, like what most
people would consider to be "paranoid" behaviors.  Like I had an
instructor once who used tissues to open doors, people weren't supposed
to go within 5 feet of em if they sneezed. . . that was kind of odd. .
.but he probably just knew some things we didn't know.

Shit gets pretty crazy if you actually do research on it. From like
bacteria everywhere to invisible insects that morph shape and mimic
human characteristics. . .

I first became interested in stuff like that from doing a lot of
research on gardening. . .like pest and disease control. Like with
indoor stuff, you have to be very very careful about contaminating other
gardens, or plants, or transferring bacteria here or there. . . the
stuff that gets on plants came from outside .. . yknow, like we're
outside. . . 

: )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: Mystery Skin Disease in Daly City

there has been a similar health epidemic in san
francisco, for a year or so.  the health dept knows
about it, it has been linked to poor hygiene, weak
immune systems, drug use, malnutrition, and similar
conditions.
it's an abscess of staph infection in most cases, is
extremely painful, and can be very dangerous depending
on location of infection and time left untreated.  it
is similar to flesh eating bacteria.  they keep
sweeping it under the rug because they assume its the
poor and the drug users.  that's often not the case.
it has been through the gay community, the dance
community, drug community, low income, ....
doctors don't know what to do with it, except
prescribe a massive dose of super antibiotics, blaming
the abscesses on 'highly evolved strains of staph'. 
most often it's misdiagnosed or left untreated at
first, because doctors can't narrow down the exact
cause.  the center for disease control is monitoring
it closely, but can't pin it down. many cases were 
supposedly related to meth use, putting 'dirty' street
drugs into an already weakened system from drug use.
everyone carries staph in and on them, but it is
opportunistic to weak systems, and more mutated
strains can be passed on by shared drug paraphenalia
and/or physical contact.
thanks for posting that info, people need to be aware
of what's out there...

Hey Everyone, just wanted to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving! If any 
of you are finding yourselves sitting around the house today -- 
enjoying the day off, but aren't really doing the whole Thanksgiving

good drink, and good company -- give me a call on my cellphone

Apparently cats are host to some kind of strange and terrible
toxoplasmosis parasite that takes up residence in your brain, and affects
your personality/inhibitions in some pretty serious ways. In rats, it
dulls their natural aversion to cats.

Squish your kitties!=)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Kill your kittens

Reading it...

  "Infected men, suggests one new study, tend to become more aggressive,
  scruffy, antisocial and are less attractive. Women, on the other hand,
  appear to exhibit the "sex kitten" effect, becoming less trustworthy,
  more desirable, fun- loving and possibly more promiscuous. 
  
  Interestingly, for those who draw glib conclusions about national
  stereotypes, the number of people infected in France is much higher than
  in the UK."

Huh. Makes one wonder about that mind/body thing, eh?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr: Mystery Skin Disease in Daly City

little bugs.  yep, pretty much. we all carry staph,
for example, but unless our immune systems are low,
they don't really affect us much.
most often, drug use (especially meth) lowers our
immune system on the most basic obvious level-- lack
of sleep, malnutrition, and dehydration.  the
opportunistic little buggers then attack, causing
infections.  
so remember kids, if yer gonna do drugs-  make sure
you eat and drink lots, take yer vities, and get
plenty of rest.  balance yer toxins.
oh, and read "Parasite Rex."  great book.

love,
dr. moreau

Subject: [sfraves] PS2 : MANHUNT!

i just got this game today... and calling it game is a stretch. it's more of 
a murder simulation.
this is absolutely the most sickest, twisted, nc-17 game i ever played. 
think of that old ahhnold movie the running man. it's sorta like that. your 
placed in a broken down city with a bunch of thugs (sorta like the gangs in 
the 'warrior's) out to get you, but you need to get them first. however, 
there is an unknown person watching you through hidden camera's all over the 
place; taunting you, telling you what to do, either helping you out, or 
fucking with your mind, but pulling the strings.
the graphics are gorgeous, the music is brilliant. soundscape all the way. 
john carpenter would be proud of the sounds in this one.
the killings are just over the top. not bloody but waaay twisted. one of the 
first ones i did was with a plastic bag. the game is based more on stealth 
and agility rather than guns a blazin. i crept up behind a gang member a put 
the bag over his head and just twisted it sooo tight that he died from 
asphxiation.
all sorts of ways to kill people. broken bottles, glass shards, shanks, 
guns... it's really brutal! the whole atmosphere of this game is really 
fucked. it's over the top in so many ways and im sure its going to be all 
over the news here shortly.
this is not a game for kids in all honesty. i don't think a lot of people 
would even like it. it's made by rockstar, and the same team that did both 
of the 'grand theft auto'. it has that 'qualitly' and appeal that GTA has, 
save this is just over the top darkness, with a wicked plot line. being told 
what to do, watching yourself over closed circut tv, and the 'persons' voice 
taunting you....... wicked...
i would recomend renting it and seeing if you like it. it's really different 
for a game. its total murderation.
it's not fun as one would think games are fun. it's really this mind 
bending, self reflecting sort of situation of a twisted plot. very deep 
philisophical tones. it's interesting cause it really is the first time that 
i really feel like i'm actaully killing, and it does have you thinking about 
how just brutal it really is. you have to be really good to make a kill. no 
button mashing at all. stealth like metalgearsolid, huge enviroments, and 
wicked gangs straight fromt he 'warriors'. 'cooomeee out and plaaaayyaaaay'
it's 'american psycho' for the PS2....
very interesting....

Woman Knocked Unconscious While Shopping
Sat Nov 29,10:27 AM ET

ORANGE CITY, Fla. - A mob of shoppers rushing for a sale on DVD players 
trampled the first woman in line and knocked her unconscious as they 
scrambled for the shelves at a Wal-Mart Supercenter.

Patricia VanLester had her eye on a $29 DVD player, but when the siren 
blared at 6 a.m. Friday announcing the start to the post-Thanksgiving sale, 
the 41-year-old was knocked to the ground by the frenzy of shoppers behind 
her.

"She got pushed down, and they walked over her like a herd of elephants," 
said VanLester's sister, Linda Ellzey. "I told them, `Stop stepping on my 
sister! She's on the ground!'"

Ellzey said some shoppers tried to help VanLester, and one employee helped 
Ellzey reach her sister, but most people just continued their rush for deals.

"All they cared about was a stupid DVD player," she said Saturday.

Paramedics called to the store found VanLester unconscious on top of a DVD 
player, surrounded by shoppers seemingly oblivious to her, said Mark 
O'Keefe, a spokesman for EVAC Ambulance.

She was flown to Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach, where doctors 
told the family VanLester had a seizure after she was knocked down and 
would likely remain hospitalized through the weekend, Ellzey said. Hospital 
officials said Saturday they did not have any information on her condition.

"She's all black and blue," Ellzey said. "Patty doesn't remember anything. 
She still can't believe it all happened."

Ellzey said Wal-Mart officials called later Friday to ask about her sister, 
and the store apologized and offered to put a DVD player on hold for her.

Wal-Mart Stores spokeswoman Karen Burk said she had never heard of a such a 
melee during a sale.

"We are very disappointed this happened," Burk said. "We want her to come 
back as a shopper."

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

My thoughts exactly.  "So sorry you got hurt, but we still want your
money."

On the ride to critical mass last night I was OVERWHELMED by the number
of shoppers out and about.  I guess the word about Buy Nothing Day isn't
spreading very far or wide.  I wanted to yell to everyone to consider
simply spending some QUALITY time with their family and friends on
christmas rather than wasting on consumerism.  Another thought is to
spend that energy on the wares of local artists and craft people.
There's so many of them around that can use a bit of support.  (Speaking
of which, I've got a friend with some FABULOUS hat designs if anyone's
interested.  Mostly faux fur, but plenty of others.  Drop me a line and
I'll make the connection.)

oesn't make for the sexy headline though.

Not necessarily. A concussion can cause a seizure. If severe enough, the
person may develop epilepsy from the injury (due to damaged blood
vessels in the brain).

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Please consider signing gay marriage petition

Hi all-

So I don't post too often, and never on politial issues, but I'm hoping some 
of you will consider signing the million gay marriage petition.  The rave 
scene has always historically been about accepting everyone, peace, live and 
let live... everything that the right wing conservatives, well, aren't.

The religious right is trying to amend the constitution of the United States 
to make gay marriage "or the legal incidents thereof" illegal forever...

Most people don't care so much about the word "marriage," but the "legal 
incidents thereof" part will erase civil unions, domestic partnerships - 
things like hospital visitation rights, adoption, owning property, joint 
health care... the saddest thing about about it is that all the gay and 
lesbian families and their kids will have no legal protections whatsoever, 
and even progressive states like California will be legally unable to 
provide them with any.

Also, note the difference between civil marriage (and civil unions, domestic 
partnerships, etc.) and religious marriage... no religious organizations are 
forced to perform same sex unions if they don't want to, and never would be 
- this is NOT a push for religious marriage, but rather to keep basic civil 
rights, like adopting your partners kids, visiting your partner in the 
hospital, buying a house together, etc.

Thats the link, and thanks for your time-

Subject: [sfraves] wal(satan)mart xmas shopper ignored/trampled by crowd suffered seizure

http://www.local6.com/news/2670095/detail.html

this is truly disgusting behavior. being trampled by hundreds of people 
trying to get sales on black friday, knocked down and having people step all 
over you causing head trauma/seizures.... and nobody stops to help...

this is one time i TRULY hope this family sues the bejezuz out of 
satan*wal*mart. holding sales that last from 6am till 9am with hundreds of 
eager shoppers waiting since 3am is just pure negligence on satan*wal*mart's 
part. i forget the website, but if it's still around since satanmart has the 
high paid lawyers going after any negative. basically it has all these 
stories from ex-employee's/customers about the absolute horror of an 
establishment satan*mart is.
boycott satan*mart and all it's truly evil anti-competitive practices and 
it's raping and piliging of small towns and local businesses....

here is a small article that i found that explains a bit about their evil 
corporation:

Wal-Mart's everyday high costs
01:00 AM EDT on Wednesday, October 22, 2003


AMERICA WORSHIPS at the altar of Everyday Low Prices. That's how Wal-Mart 
can get away with ravaging American wages, benefits and the jobs themselves. 
That's how Wal-Mart can go on hollowing out America's downtowns -- and with 
taxpayer subsidies, to boot.

Wal-Mart is not the only big-box discounter turning the American countryside 
into a "crudscape" and its working people into paupers. But the monster 
leads the pack in terms of size and its holy crusade to cut costs. With $245 
billion in revenues last year, Wal-Mart is the world's largest company. 
Sales at the Bentonville, Ark.-based giant are bigger than the combined 
total of Home Depot, Target, Sears and Kroger.

Business Week described the "everyday low prices" slogan as the core value 
of "a cult masquerading as a company." All those yellow smiley faces and 
front-door "greeters" are part of a bigger strategy: to get rich off 
America's workers while undercutting them at every turn. What am I talking 
about? Here are the particulars:

-- Wal-Mart likes to call its sales clerks "associates," but "serfs" would 
be more like it. The company paid its salespeople an average $8.23 an hour 
in 2001. At that wage, a full-time worker made only $13,861 a year. The 
poverty level for a family of three was $14,630. Only 38 percent of 
Wal-Mart's workers have health coverage. It should surprise no one that 
nearly half of Wal-Mart's employees quit every year. (Before the recession, 
the annual turnover rate was 70 percent.)

-- Wal-Mart is destroying factory jobs in America. Example: Levi Strauss was 
one of the last apparel makers to actually produce stuff in the United 
States. But the made-in-America label means zip to Wal-Mart, which scours 
the globe's sweatshops for the sweetest prices. Demands for the cheapest 
jeans have forced Levi Strauss to shut down about a dozen U.S. plants. A 
factory in San Antonio is about to become the latest casualty.

Wal-Mart lobbies furiously in Washington for free-trade deals that guarantee 
a flood of goods made by pennies-an-hour labor ($12 billion worth from China 
alone last year). Small wonder America's manufacturers call Wal-Mart the 
Beast from Bentonville.

-- To Wal-Mart, unions are the devil and must be destroyed. Three years ago, 
meat cutters in Jacksonville, Texas, tried to establish the first Wal-Mart 
union. Eleven days after they joined the United Food and Commercial Workers, 
Wal-Mart closed all the meat-cutting departments at its stores and started 
buying pre-cut meat.

Wal-Mart is now on a rampage to devour the nation's supermarkets, and so 
threatens workers everywhere. Its Supercenter stores, which sell groceries, 
have already sent more than 20 national supermarket chains into bankruptcy. 
Wal-Mart has plans for 1,000 new Supercenters.

Terrified of a Wal-Mart invasion, California's three biggest supermarket 
chains have tried to lower their own costs by demanding concessions from 
their unionized employees. The result is a strike by 70,000 workers at 
supermarkets in southern California.

-- Wal-Mart is paving over America and destroying our communities. Its ugly 
boxes, plopped down on the edge of town, vacuum up business from local 
shopkeepers. (So much for any notion of customer loyalty.)

A group named Sprawl-Busters was formed 10 years ago to block Wal-Mart from 
forcing itself onto Greenfield, Mass. Every day, five or six towns from 
across the country contact Sprawl-Busters for advice on stopping a Wal-Mart, 
according to the group's founder, Al Norman. "It's not even about shopping," 
Norman says. "It's about how we relate to the places we live in. These towns 
are being changed economically, physically and socially."

-- Wal-Marts hurt surrounding communities. Iowa State University economist 
Kenneth Stone has studied the impact of Wal-Mart on rural Iowa. He found 
that some business districts benefited from a Wal-Mart but other towns 
within 20 miles suffered badly, with retail sales plummeting 25 percent 
after five years. Having lost their local merchants, the people in 
surrounding areas find themselves driving long distances to the Wal-Mart.

The line of groups calling for a boycott of Wal-Mart and its Sam's Club 
subsidiary grows by the week. As a former Wal-Mart customer, your author 
appreciates the lure of a good price. But there are competing values. When 
we understand the real cost of these "everyday low prices," they don't seem 
much of a bargain at all.

Please stop sending me subliminal messages. ;)

satan...satan...satan...satan *foams at the mouth*

I saw this elsewhere. I dunno if this is the same story, but the last one
I read was pretty sensationalistic. Nonetheless, this kind of scene
doesn't surprise me at all. Wallmart, as a corporation, is pretty foul...
but I think we're all a little too quick to shovel the blame onto them.
What about the people that were actually involved in this mad mob scene?
It says something distinctly unpleasant about our culture when we will
turn into a ravening mob over a fucking dvd player, and nearly kill a
person in our consuming frenzy.

Personally, I hope this isn't just a 'rar stupid corporations' story for
people... but a 'gee golly gosh batman, maybe we need to stop being
wild-eyed herd animals' message. That human beings would do this to one
another over a piece of consumer electronics is disgusting. We should all
be ashamed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] wal(satan)mart xmas shopper ignored/trampled by crowd suffered seizure

	Yes, such disgusting behavior could only come as a result of a mad  
frenzy induced by a sale at a large store like WalMart. Of course  
something like this could NEVER occur in the music scene. Right? (sigh)

http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/chi- 
030217stampedelist,0,6283772.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-headlines

	Imagine you go to see an artist or DJ everyone's been talking about  
who's finally come to town. You wait for hours in a big crowd of people  
to get in, realizing that if there was a sudden rush for the door,  
you'd be in big trouble. But you get in OK, and the event totally goes  
off. You leave with a smile on your face. Some people wouldn't  
understand why you would spend big $$ to go listen to ear-splitting  
music in a smoky room in a room full of sweaty people in the middle of  
the night -- any more than you understand why they'd go to WalMart in  
the middle of the night to save big $$.

	You see the promoter on your way out, and he smiles at you and gives a  
wave. You're about to smile back and tell him how much you loved the  
show, when you remember what someone posted on SFRaves. So instead you  
yell at him, "You negligent f---, are you trying to get people killed  
with this crowd? I hope someone sues the bejeezus out of you!"

	After all, everybody knows WalMart is evil and must be blamed when  
something goes wrong, and you're not the kind of person to hold a  
double standard.

Groove on,
						<<< Starchild >>>

hello, this is your on-line ravers advent calender with the continuing countdown till christmas! ......"now that the three wize raver boys know what to wear and where to go, they had time to stop for some hot cocoa! as they sit together in the 24 hour donut shop, they each think to themselves about true love, sex and donuts...none of them would ever admit to a soul the real truth...why should anyone, anyway? if you had a love interest who could bake circles around your ego, wouldn't you just hang with your fuzzy friends  in the donut shop too? who needs sex and cakes, when there are friends who have multiple things in common and fried bread to eat that has been sitting in a window all day long next to the old coffee?"...more later...:)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR/SRR: Re: "Christmas" Shopping

" Another thought is to
spend that energy on the wares of local artists and
craft people.
There's so many of them around that can use a bit of
support."

Thanks for a great opportunity for me to post about
Phantom galleries on this list. I put SRR in since I
show my work at raves and I'm selling purses that are
plastic (rave goo washes right off, I checked.) and
glow in black light (no surprise if you have seen my
work!) LOL! Plus I'm selling some non commital
"Seasonal" cards.(if you are like me, and you don't
want to advertise your religion, but want your friends
and family to know you care and/or don't object to
theirs or like me come from a mixed family, they also
work well for unitarians) 

For those of you who are not farmilliar with Phantom
galleries, they take empty Retail space in Downtown
San Jose and use it to display local artists work.
They are only taking a 30% commission ( galleries
usualy take 50%) and the 30% goes directly to the
PhantoM Galleries Project. I like the project so much
that I happily kept my work at the "wholesale" price
because I want to support the project. I know other
artists are doing the same, some selling much below
their usual gallery price ( the limit for this show is
$150.)  This is the offical announcement:
 
We invite you to attend the Second Annual 
Holiday Gallery of Gifts 
featuring: I'm supposed to put my name here, but since
there are about 50 other artists participating I think
you should know that instead of me just puting my name
here.  

Grand Opening Artists' Reception: Friday, November
28th, 7pm -9 pm 
Light buffet, refreshments, entertainment and holiday
spirit! 

A wonderful assortment of original works of art,
textiles, jewelry, clothing, cards and unique gifts
for the holiday season as presented by over 50 local
artists and non-profit organizations. 

Gallery Location and Hours: 
55 South First Street (@ Post Street), Downtown San
Jose 
Mon. - Sat., Noon - 7pm, through December 20th, 2003 

Free parking after 6 pm and weekends at many downtown
lots, visit www.sjdowntownparking.com for more
information. 


The Holiday Gallery of Gifts is produced by Two Fish
Design Group, part of POPULUS Presents, a public space
activation collective coordinated by the San Jose
Downtown Association in partnership with the San Jose
Redevelopment Agency. For more information call
408-271-5151 or visit: www.POPULUSpresents.com

any respectable promoter and/or venue will shut the doors when the space
reaches a comfortable capacity, regardless of whether it is prior to the
legal capacity. they will also ensure that there is sufficient room to
move around in all areas, including hallways and other points of crowd
congestion.

i agree that irresponsible & money-hungry behavior occurs in all
businesses, including the music scene.

i disagree with the implication that people who object to behavior like
wal-mart's would tolerate the same type of behavior elsewhere in their
lives.

yes, i would confront a promoter who packed a venue to the point of
creating a dangerous situation... and i'd do it on my way out the door,
explaining why it would be my last time attending one of their events.


people over profit,

kimberley d.


p.s. it seems more relevant to discuss people who are creating public
spaces where intimacy & community are valued. most people already know the
places which are not doing that.

	Simply following a policy of "shut the doors when the space reaches 
capacity" will not eliminate risk of injury or death, because similar 
tragedies have occurred when a venue *stopped* letting people in and a 
crowd kept pressing forward when there was nowhere to go.

	There are two fundamental choices here:

(1) Pretend that total safety is an option, jump through hoops in 
pursuit of it, and look for someone to blame when something goes wrong, 
or

(2) Accept that life automatically comes with a certain amount of risk, 
take this into consideration, and make your choices accordingly.

	That woman who got trampled at WalMart was obviously there for the 
sale herself, and presumably was among the first in line in order to 
have been trampled by all the people coming up behind her.

	Of course nobody wants to be mean and add insult to injury by saying 
she should have taken responsibility for her own health condition, 
surroundings, and personal well-being by not placing herself in front 
of that crowd. We all feel sorry for her, so it's easier to blame the 
big, "evil," "greedy" corporation, or the "greedy" customers who didn't 
risk their own safety to try to stop in the middle of the onrushing 
crowd to render assistance.

	I'm not saying it was this woman's fault she got trampled. It was 
probably no one's fault. But looking for an external culprit whenever 
an accident occurs is in itself a symptom of greed -- the greed for 
money of the trial lawyers who make a killing on these types of 
lawsuits and who've got everybody looking for culprits who can pay, and 
the greed for power of government regulators who would like to take 
control of every aspect of your life in the name of making you safe.

	Ultimately, those who take responsibility for themselves are the ones 
who are safer. Nobody else can guarantee your safety, nor should they 
be expected to. Accidents happen, even though we all wish they didn't.

Groove on,

if you have given money to someone, whether they be wal-mart, a rave
promoter, or joe billy-bob, you probably had expectations about what you
would receive in return. true, those expectations shouldn't usurp your own
common sense... but i can't imagine expecting nothing from the business
that you financially supported.

anyway, it's all shades of gray and placing blame is an exercise in
futility. i don't think the people who denounced wal-mart were doing so in
direct response to that article, anyway.
