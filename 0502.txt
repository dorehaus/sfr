World Social Forum: Activists Urge Free Open-Source Software

By Alan Clendenning

January 30, 2005 by the Associated Press


PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil -- Activists at a leftist gathering
where Microsoft is viewed as a corporate bogeyman urged
developing nations Saturday to leap into the information age
with free open-source software.

John Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, told a
gathering inside a packed warehouse that poor nations can't
solve their problems unless they stop paying expensive
software licensing fees.

Open source software includes programs that are not
controlled by a single company. The software can be developed
by anyone, with few restrictions. The best known such
software is the Linux operating system, which can be
downloaded free from the Internet.

"Already, Brazil spends more in licensing fees on proprietary
software than it spends on hunger," said Barlow, co-founder
of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a cyberspace civil
liberties group.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] The FURIOUS2 Ride Home w/ Dina! PT1

This is a true story mind U!  I mean.. every time I'm graced w/ a ride
home from Dfly.. some crazy shit always happens!!  So like I kinda cut
from Furious2 like a lil' earlier than expected, but ya know... since it
was a ride on the way 4 other people 2 like go home, then it's all good &
thankfully Dfly & Terri were nice enough 2 do that!!  YAY!!!  Granted I
was invited 2 get laid 2 times like minutes b4 I was leaving & although it
wass temping 4 me 2 stay even just 4 that... ooh...oooooooooh.. i think
getting home when i coulda was like more Mondo important!

So we were cruisin home in the Dfly Mobile talkin' about the shindig &
ofcourse, gossiping about who was there & what was saw & who saw what as
well as who heard what with whom & where, ya know!!  Oooh my Goodness,
Hello 2Day, if the walls could talk!

So like the not even when we were off that mondo bridge ramp thingie that
connects 2 80, we saw HUGE bniking signs telling us that lanes were
closed..

"Oh great.. back roads 2 Hercules then!" I thought.  "Well, this is
perfect 4 catch up time!"

The freeway construction led us to the Ashby Exit off 80 (hmmm... familiar
from the last time Dina brought me home)...

"Osby, U know how to get home from here & tell me where to drive, right?"
Dina asked me!

"Duh!!" I said!  "Hey Divafly, U saw that girl flash U when U were
spinning, right?" I asked...

"Dude, that girl flahed me like 5 times while i was spinning!  I dunno
man.. her tits are Big & fake, I don't like that!" she said

"Wait U 2," Terri said as we pulled up 2 a stop light, "that's the same
girl that kept wanting me 2 kiss her the whole night.. she had that
feather thing on her hat, right???  Oh my gosh, she squeezed my boobs &
told me she really wanted me to kiss her!  I was like eeew!"

Me & Dina looked @ each other & laughed so hard!  I dunno man.. that was
so funny 4 some reason!!!  But it like alright ben' delirious @ 3:30 AM,
right?  So like just as we finished laughing, the light turned green & the
phone rang!!!

"Hell... Ma???  Ma... what's so funny??  Did u just get back from the
Shark & seafood feed right now??  uh hu.. who??  Really???
ahaaaaaahahahaha.. Ma you're 2 much... you're so fuckin' hillarious!"

"Yo D.. yer suppose to tur..." I said as dina missed the turn she was
suppose 2 like turn...

"Ma, I'm gonna drive Osby HOme then we're gonna crash at your boat house
on the Carquniez Dock.. OK??? yeah.. yeah.. I know, don't let the Turtles
take a bath w/ Terri, yeah, we brought our wetsuits to sleep in the
waterbed, yeah Ma, I know... Love U too, BaBye!" & hung up... "Sorry Oz,
is there another turn we can take?"

"Yeah, here comes Telegraph, we can turn here...."

Dina Turned right....

"...make a left I was gonna say ummmm.. ok.. this is Groovy!" I said as I
laughed...

"Dude, U tell me 2 turn b4 we turn!"

"Hey guys, what the fuck is that running down the street?" Terri yelled as
we looked!  A bull was running down the street, weird!  "Hey, there's a
burger joint.. let's eat, my treat!"  So we went 2 the burger place &
ordered food!

"Hey... that's that gay bar/ club place there on the corner where I spun 4
a stripper once," Dina said!  So we looked!  There was all this noise
comin from there & a bunch of chicken feathers like in front of the
door...

"Oh oh oh.. I wanna go see what's goin' on in there!" I said as i heard
Dina & Terri yelling my name to go back 2 them!! Then I heard loud shoes
running towards me & looked behind me... it was Terri & Dina running
also...

"Osby... slow down, we're coming to!" Terri said as she was running in her
8 inch cloggy tap high heals!

We got 2 the door & it was cracked open

"Oh Shit.." the 4 of us said @ the same time... (Oh yeah.. I took my
invisble friend Bob w/ me 2 the party)

OK... I'll stop here 4 now & continue when I wakeup!  Crazy!!  It gets
better!  Night Night!

-------------------------------1107269457
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Two years ago today, I was relaxing after a great party and was up all  night 
(you know how that goes, all that energy after a great party). I turned on  
the TV and said, "wow what a coincidence, the space shuttle is landing right  
now! I really turned the TV on at the right time."
 
Uh huh. Just after I started watching, the shuttle turned into a ball of  
flame. What did I just see? The people on the news didn't know what to say at  
first. Then, I was transfixed as they started to realize and describe what had  
just happened. They played it over and over. What a sad thing to see when 
coming  down from all the great party energy ... sad thing any time, I mean, but  
especially when feeling so happy before. 
 
So yeah ... I am not a fan of Bush's space program but I love space travel  
in general. ok the shuttle's orbit was very close to the earth's surface and  
barely qualifies as "space," but it still counts. 
 
yesterday's newspaper showed that a newly designed shuttle fuel tank  arrived 
at the Cape. Supposedly the same kind of accident can't happen again. No  
spray-on foam insulation. 
 
One good thing, I guess, is that we've learned to work well with the  
Russians. 
 
That's it, i gotta leave for work. I hope everybody has a great week,
JonnyR 
 
p.s.  I haven't been to any parties in a while but I'll be  back

Good point.  First parties I attended were by a psytrance group, Bioharmonics.  Dunno if anyone has ever heard of them.  Apparently the collective disbanded a few years ago.
 
Damn good partees though, usually around east oakland.
 
Lost some sweet hubcaps one night... it was worth it though.

Also... what about Thump, Blue Room parties at 550? The whole psytrance 
side of the scene? Not really my thing but it has played a big part in 
shaping our bay area music scene. You might want to get someone to chime 
in on that part of the history if this is to be a complete effort.

if open mind doesn't pan out you can always find what
you are looking for on gemm.com although you may have
to pay for it. 

i usually find hard to find stuff at a reasonable
price but i have paid $80 for a couple records i
really wanted, althought at was on ebay.

And the young'uns with good taste! :)

More potentially great acts: Josh Wink, M83, Tiga, Swayzak, Roots
Manuva, Miss Kittin, M.I.A., Matthew Dear, Diplo and Matmos. *This* is a
lineup I just might pay several hundred dollars to see!

Shame about Coldplay taking top billing though, I think they're one of
the most over-rated bands on earth right now.

Heh, I was thinking the same thing. As for the Prodigy, what do you
think the chances are that they'll play anything from Experience or

Heh, I was thinking the same thing. As for the Prodigy, what do you
think the chances are that they'll play anything from Experience or
Jilted?

quoth CHUCK G:

> sex?

Erm, maybe. IMO, though:

NIN != sexy. I thought they were before I'd ever even had sex, but now
they just seem a little contrived. Possible exception: "Reptile".

Chemical Brothers != sexy. Tom and Ed are just too nerdy to make sexy
music, period.

The Prodigy != sexy. They just all seem like a bunch of tweakers to me,
and their music reflects that. Some stuff on Jilted might be deep enough
for getting down, but I can't say I'd ever put their CD on if I were
expecting to get laid.

Here are some suggestions off the top of my head:

Aeroc - Viscous Solid (made entirely from sampled acoustic guitars)
Cylob - Cylobian Sunset (classic ambient/IDM)
FSOL - Lifeforms (no embellishment necessary))
Fabric 12 - The Amalgamation Of Soundz (great progression!)
Herbert - Around the House (deep, sexy click-house)
Massive Attack - No Protection (dub mixes by Mad Professor)
Nightmares on Wax - Carboot Soul (dubbed out vocal trip-hop)
Peter Kruder - Peace Orchestra (ultra-deep dischordant sex music)
Thomas Fehlmann - Lowflow (deep, dubby houseno)

Cheers,

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: What was your most memorable party between 199

1)  the day i met Osby.  Unity party at SF City Hall.  i went to the party 
alone but ran into several friends.  i remember seeing a photo of Osby that 
someone posted a link to on SFR months earlier.  then, all of a sudden, i 
saw this dude who looked like the photo.  this was on the marble steps of 
city hall.  so i went up to him and introduced myself.  two things i 
remember. one, i realized "damn, this guy talks just like he writes on SFR." 
  two, he asked me if i liked happy hardcore.  i said "no."

2)  thump at 550.  disco d was in the back room.  i got osby fucking drunk.  
i got my newly turned 21 friend leslie drunk.  some dude kept hitting on her 
and asked me if she was single.  that dude was moshen, who became a good 
friend of mine.  that night, i met Tim and Eva for the first time.  we all 
went out for food afterwards.  Tim and Eva recently got married and are now 
my housemates.

3)  the night i met Veanne.  it was outside 550.  i danced.  she called me a 
"fucking raver" and laughed at me.  and i thought to myself "damn, i hope i 
run into this girl again."

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ DreamTeam Thursday @ Ruby Skye

So I know none of you like RS.. and that the crowd is lame.. BUT this is DJ
DreamTeam and should be an amazing night of funky, deep, and tribal house,
with some breaks for good measure and I was wondering if:

1. Do you think it is a good list.. who would you have liked to have seen in
the top 10 if you could pick 1 DJ?

2. Does anyone have a lineup for the set times?

What I have so far: (please fill in if you have info :) thanks!

So maybe 45 minute sets?? 9 dj's in 7.5 hours (7:30p-3am) 

#1 Miguel Migs, #2 Mark Farina, #3 Lorin, #4 M3, #5 Laird, #6 Jeno, #7 Ellen
Ferrato, #8 Smoove, #9 Jondi & Spesh, #10 Kaskade (not attending due to tour
conflict) 


Seven: 7:30p 
DJ F: 8:15p 
9:00p <- maybe M3 Funky Manny :P 
9:45p <- mayby E. Ferrato 
10:30p <- maybe Jeno 
11:15p <- maybe Smoove 
Farina: 12:00a 
Migs: 12:45a 
Lorin: 1:30a 
2:15a <- maybe laird 
3:00a <- maybe Jondi & Spesh for closing 30 mins or something?? 

If anyone can help fill in the schedule it would be so sweet.. they are
being really secretive about releasing it for some reason. I have emailed
the 3 times.. to no avail.

Hope to see some of you there.

Ranger

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ DreamTeam Thursday @ Ruby Skye

Lorin is going to tear Migs and Farina new assholes.  as good as they are, 
they play mellow shit.  Lorin will destroy that place with breaks and hip 
hop.  he will also put way more energy into his set than both of them 
combined.

breaks will destroy.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ DreamTeam Thursday @ Ruby Skye

Yup.. and I can't believe they put Laird at 8:30p.. "what idiots.. god..
sheesh".  - Napoleon Dynamite

Lorin said he is not going to spin breaks but instead focus on some of his
classic dessert experience mixes.. since I didn't catch Lorin in the desert
last year.. I am not sure what this means.. but I know it will be hot as
f%ck and the place will be booty shakin.. cuz that is just how he does it!!

I just want to hear Laird tear something up.. but I will miss half his set..
perhaps the will let me set up my MD :) hehe.. ya right!!

i vote for any monolake live set (~3 hours of minimal
grooviness), or the thomas brinkmann interpretation of
plastikman's sheet one at 1/3 speed. bass inside the
place is very inspiring of tactile fun.

Yeah house sucks, I hate that mellow shit.  I wish there was a gabbercore DJ
in the top ten to really crank up the energy.

I'm more miffed that they're using Ruby Skye as a two room venue.  Hey Jeno,
you're one of SF's top ten DJs and you've been contributing to our scene for
well beyond a decade, come play for us in the 20 person capacity smoking
lounge and try not to hack up a lung, k?

I would've agreed with you if I hadn't seen Farina tear it up last time
I saw him (w/Derrick Carter at Mezzanine). You'd be amazed how well a
couple of cleverly placed Solid Groove remixes work to spice up a
relatively tame house set.

Gotta say it though: Ruby Skye really sucks. I went there to see Danny
Tenaglia a couple of weeks ago and it was just horrible. Not only did
the crowd suck, but Tenaglia was such a disappointment. I'm not planning
on going back there for a looooong time.

TTFN,

perhaps a 4 hour tantric love making session.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: sex music

Sometimes NIN can be good.. especially if its ex-sex.  For the hard edge
though I prefer Lords of Acid/Praga Khan.

My top 3 albums in no particular order:

Freaky Chakra - Blacklight Fantasy (really deep, sweaty music.. the kind
of music that reminds you of summer nights where its too hot to sleep with
no chance of cooling off so why not get hotter)

Astralasia  - 7-Pointed Star  (fast fantasy dreamscape)

Kruder and Dorfmeister -  The K&D Sessions, but really anything by them as
well. I mean that is pretty much why they make music. :)

I like to get freaky when i just simply hear Michaels voice, specially
when he's screaming Tip-to-Tip, nothing gets me in the mood more than
that.

if you like K+D, then you'll probably like my black sunrise
mix.

http://mp3.stargaze.org/SG_DJs/Red_Stickman/Red%20Stickman%20-%20Black%20Sunrise.mp3

tracklisting is here:
http://redstickman.homestead.com/tracklisting.html

there's also some tosca on my "ending of sorts" mix.  some say
that's better for sex, but i wouldn't know...i don't listen to
my mixes during sex.  ;)

http://speed.speedera.com/scosol/redstickman_anending.ogg

it's in .ogg format, winamp should be able to open it.

Hah, I only listen to "The Control Structure" when I'm doin' it!

Seriously though... K&D, Peace Orchestra and Tosca (the latter two being
solo/side projects of Kruder and Dorfmeister, respectively) are the
shit. "Chocolate Elvis" might be a bit weird for humping though. :)

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Not that any o' you care, lol....

...But I'm back in the Bay Area! Woohoo!!

20 degreee weather and shitty attitudes suck my asshole - but other than 
that my time in DC was pretty well spent. Buzz was completely insane - we 
were asked to spin the opening set on top of our 4 hour set at the last 
minute...and managed to do the majority of both sets completely hammered 
drunk - oops. We had asses shaking all night - so it musta not been too damn 
bad.

That was really the main highlight - the other 3 gigs, although very cool - 
were lowkey in comparison.

I am ecstatic to be back though - as the east coast gets real old real damn 
quiclk...

I will see you all very soon - and I have a couple of upcoming gigs here 
(2/12 & 2/19) - so lookout for info on those!!!

Subject: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: SFRaves DJ Dreamteam

Q: All this talk about an SF DJ DREAMTEAM made me think -  IYHO: Who 
do you consider your SFRaves / Hyperreal Community DJ Dreamteam?

Please limit responses to those who actively participate in this 
community, well known, bedroom dj or not that you would like to see 
assembled as an SFRaves DJ Dreamteam. All genres welcome.

If you don't want to limit it to those who participate in this 
community, let's create a list of those who would be considered the 
DJ Dreamteam of SFRaves community subscriber picks.

Thoughts?
Karina

Subject: [sfraves] SFRaves dinners

I've organized dinners for impromptu get togethers for SFRaves members 
before, and am interested in having more to throw down the Peace, Love, 
Unity and Respect for SFRavers. Any takers?

Depending on interest and availability - time, date, place TBD

I try and schedule dinners in various locales (SC, South Bay, Ebay, NoBay, 
SF, Peninsula, et al) so that a reach is created in each area. It's a fun 
way for people to get together between events, a way to gather a community 
presence in person, and get to know your fellow Community members outside 
the virtual arena.

If interested, please respond here, or alternative you can contact me via 
karina@hyperreal.org or / YIM/AIM (located in my Member profile)

Much love to you!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: SFRaves DJ Dreamteam

let's see here, if i'm limited to djs that post on here regularly, then here 
we go.  in no particular order:

stickman - have seen him spin multiple genres and spin them well
andyw - techno, sure...but also known for moments of leftfield genius
indigo - funky and groovy and bouncy
marco - for his skill, probably the most underbooked dj i know on this list
andrew phelan - house music all night long
chris jackson - machine
koroma - tribal, techy and bangin
drag'nfly - never heard a bad set from this woman

where the hell are the dnb djs on this list? also a lack of progressive 
house djs and hardly any trance (yes, i like trance sometimes so fuck off).

Subject: [sfraves] SRR > Looking for new tennats for :  live-in lofts,  Electonica Music Culture Studios, New or Recovering business incubator 

Over the next few months, We will be taking over leases, purchasing vacant
spaces etc, in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose . The plan is to acquire
multi story buildings. The upper levels will be live/work lofts. The lower
levels will be for business incubator space for new or recovering business,
or non profits that are more grateful to have a space rather than have gold
door handles and marble floors! The locations will also hold several "Fund
Raiser" style events in the musical arts genre each month. Flexible tenants
are a  must. More information to follow. I am just getting the word out to
see who may be interested, how much you are able to afford monthly, the
amount of space needed etc. We are looking to offer to VoIP (Voice over IP)
to all of our tenants, as it will also me a beta test for one of our
services soon to launch/go public.

If you are interested, please email me privately. I would love to get your
opinions. needs etc. assembled so the proper building will be acquired ;-) 

Also, we are needing 1099 independent and experienced technology sales reps.
We are also taking applications for field IT Technicians. 

If you are failure with desktop support, helpdesk etc. 

Any or all of the following a major plus MCSE, MCP, A+, Linux/Unix Jr.
Level, CCIE, CCNE, CCNA, Please visit www.HawkRidgeTech.com 


Take care,
matt

1.   DISCIPLINARY HEARING AGAINST KELLY'S MISSION ROCK

Last week, two days of hearings were conducted at the Entertainment 
Commission on a Suspension/Revocation action brought by the San Francisco 
Police Department against the Kelly's Mission Rock (KMR) entertainment 
venue.  The Police Department alleges that KMR operations have created an 
ongoing nuisance in the neighborhood, involving excessive noise, fights and 
auto sideshows.  The first two days of the hearing primarily involved the 
City presenting nuisance charges against KMR, with cross examination of 
witnesses by KMR attorneys.  Testimony was presented by Bayview police 
officers as well as neighbors.  The defense had begun to make its case when 
the second day of testimony was adjourned.

The hearing will continue on Feb. 22 at 5pm at the Entertainment Commission 
in Room 406 of City Hall.  These hearings are open to the public.

This is the first disciplinary hearing adjudicated by the Entertainment 
Commission since its formation in 2003.  Prior to the formation of the 
Entertainment Commission, the San Francisco Police Department both brought 
charges and conducted disciplinary hearings against permitted venues.  One 
of the reasons for the creation of the Entertainment Commission was to 
eliminate this potential conflict of interest.  Under the current system, 
the charges are being brought by the Police Department but are being heard 
by the Entertainment Commission, which is an independent body with 
representatives of the entertainment industry, neighbor groups, public 
health, law enforcement and city planning.

Stay tuned for ongoing updates on the disciplinary hearings on Kelly's 
Mission 
Rock.

2  "TURNING THE TIDE" AN LGBT BENEFIT FOR TSUNAMI RELIEF

The SFLNC is joining up with groups from the LGBT community to help raise 
funds for Tsunami disaster relief.  This event will take place on Saturday, 
Feb. 5th from 8pm to 4am at Terra, 511 Harrison St. in San Francisco.  The 
night will feature an art sale, a live/silent auction, food, drinks, 
cabaret acts and DJs, including DJ Pusspuss and Liam Shy from the SFLNC.

Check out the flyer and full line-up at 
<http://www.queercares.com/>http://www.queercares.com/.

START SOMA + local artist Tim Gaskin have put together a very special art 
show in conjunction with this benefit. Basically, they have created a giant 
16,000 square foot ART MARKET, similar to the exhibition organized for 
their successful SFLNC fundraiser last year.  Over fifty artists. LOTS of 
great art at great prices. Participating artists get half of all art sales. 
The other half goes to the Rainbow World Fund.  The art show will be open 
from 8pm-12 midnight.

All proceeds from this event will go directly to CARE International via the 
Rainbow World Fund (www.rainbowfund.org).

Tickets are only $10 at the door so come on out, have a great time and help 
with the ongoing tsunami relief effort


3. HELP SAVE THE HARDING THEATER

The Harding Theatre, the last remaining theater on Divisadero Street and 
one of the City's best preserved neighborhood theaters is threatened with 
demolition.  The Harding was operated as a church for many years but was 
sold to a developer who now plans to demolish the theater.  The Harding 
opened in 1926 and was designed by the Reid Brothers, a prominent San 
Francisco architectural firm that also designed the Fairmont Hotel.  The 
Harding has served the community as a neighborhood movie theater, a live 
theater, a music venue and most recently as a church.

Unfortunately, during the Harding's years as a church the exterior of the 
theater fell into disrepair and as a result most people have no idea that a 
beautiful theater remains intact inside.   According the the SF Bay 
Guardian 
(<http://www.sfbg.com/39/18/x_biznews.html>http://www.sfbg.com/39/18/x_biznews.html), 
the SF Planning Department approved the demolition permit without 
inspection based on developer claims that the historic elements had been 
removed.  Neighborhood activists instead have presented photos showing the 
interior to be mostly intact.

The Harding Theater is also right next to the Independent Music venue, so 
it is inevitable that the construction of condos next to a major music 
venue will threaten the Independent.  A coalition of local business owners 
have proposed preserving the theater and turning it into an arts, theater 
and entertainment complex. The SFLNC supports the construction of 
additional housing, but this must be done with proper planning.  Approving 
the demolition of a historic theater to build condos in a neighborhood 
commercial district next to an existing entertainment venue is a huge 
mistake by the SF planning department that should be opposed.  For more 
info on how to save the Harding Theater, go to

willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."

I've organized dinners for impromptu get togethers for SFRaves members 
before, and am interested in having more to throw down the Peace, Love, 
Unity and Respect for SFRavers. Any takers?

Depending on interest and availability - time, date, place TBD

I try and schedule dinners in various locales (SC, South Bay, Ebay, NoBay, 
SF, Peninsula, et al) so that a reach is created in each area. It's a fun 
way for people to get together between events, a way to gather a community 
presence in person, and get to know your fellow Community members outside 
the virtual arena.

If interested, please respond here, or alternative you can contact me via 
karina@hyperreal.org or / YIM/AIM (located in my Member profile)

Much love to you!

something here the first night i'm here. For those that remember John
D aka Antitux I met up with him and Jason Wall (White Rabbit//dk) as
well. Need to track down Jack Triumph too. Scottsdale. Hmm. Tempe - uh
- Palo Alto relocated to the desert. No joke. I swear I was on

It's called the Cheeba Hut, and it's right near ASU. There's also a
hooka cafe called King Tut's in Tempe, and a cool coffee house called
the Willow House in Phoenix. Other than that, the clubs and parties
there are ass. Have fun in Atlanta Ryan!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Doctor recommendations?  - Kaiser

so i'm signing up for healthcare with my semi-new job and figured i'd put 
this question out there.

physician that you like and would recommend?

so hard to choose a doctor from a website.  anyone?

Hey Buddy,
 
I work for a company that actually pays for Kaiser as a perk. . . It sucks- worst health "care" ever. I wound up paying extra to get a PPO. If I couldn't afford a PPO, I'd go to a public clinic before I went back to Kaiser. And forget about that "primary" physician crap, you'll see them once or twice a year, maybe; if you're deathly ill, and lucky. 
 
If you're stuck with Kaiser, I advise you find a primary physician that practices in a satellite office- away from any of their main campuses or hospitals. I notice that a lot of their physicians have good credentials (i.e. Stanford, Berkeley, etc.), but like I said, actually getting in to see one is the trick. 
 
Oh yeah- one last note- when you're sick, they always make you talk to an "advice nurse" before you can come in. The A.N.'s are only there to tell you to gurgle on salt water when you have a sore throat & to get rest. IGNORE THEM & DEMAND AN APPOINTMENT. Dealing with an HMO is like dealing with SBC, except your health is on the line instead of some phone bill they fucked up.
 
Happy, Happy. 
 
peace
 
Chuck

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Doctor recommendations?  - Kaiser

kaiser is a humongous organization.

and although i've heard many reports like mr. G's, there are some great
doctors for kaiser.

i've never had a problem scheduling a visit w/ my primary physician.  i
have to wait a few weeks but not a problem to get an appointment.

urgent care is available in most areas until about 8:30pm.  i've never
spoken to an advice nurse.

i'm not saying mr. G is wrong.  i'm saying i've had other experiences.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Doctor recommendations?  - Kaiser



yeah, I have been with kaiser for a long time and I have no real complaints.
In my expereince, they seem to be very scared of getting sued, so they
seem to always take as many tests, ect as possible.  They won't tell
you to come in for checkups, but if you want one, they will give you one.

Different kaiser locations vary quite a bit.  For example, the SF campus
on Geary street I have always been happy with... while the Oakland location
does seem to suck.

hello,  this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
 
"wake up, ig. wake up."
 
"huh?"
 
"are you okay?"
 
"i was having a nightmare."
 
"what was your dream about?"
 
"well, in the dream, i had a sister, and my sister had a boyfriend, and the boyfriend was a total freak. he would copy my sister's way of speaking when talking with other people, because he thought people would like him better, but the whole time, he was a total loser, and i couldn't wake up. thanks, supa. i am glad it was just a dream."
 
"me too. maybe you should think about something else so that you will be able to sleep again."
 
"think about something else? like what?"
 
"how about investments."
 
"what kind of investments?"
 
"well, what do you think would be a good thing to invest in during the next few days."
 
"how about some hotdogs?"
 
"that is pretty good. with the game coming up, that is probably one of the most sound investments you would be able to make, ig. i am proud of you for noticing."
 
"i didn't notice anything other than my growling stomach." :)

some people say i'm metro.  but i'm not.  i'm pretty geigh. 
but i like women.  not really the doods.  maybe it's some sort
of identity crisis.  i don't think so.  i know i'm more metro
than geigh.  the gay doods are all, "what's up with that?"  i'm
all, "i dunno.  i'm sorry..."

:(  <--- sad expression on my face

but yeah, you know who's metro?  i know lots of metro doods. 
it's not like i'm outing them, because if you see 'em on the
street, they stand out like a sore thumb.  well, that doesn't
really stand out.  anyway, here they are:

SE-30 dave  <-- king of metros: wristwatch collection from hell
brandon <-- i think it's because he's asian and so smooth
origami/george <-- he's got the look, and he's mighty sexy
ryan <-- prissy.designer.fashion.sex
nico <-- nuff said
viberation kevin <-- he's too much of a nazi. real pretty, tho
"gay" matt <-- i think the name says it all. he's got a g/f.

=-O  <----surprised expression on my face.  I guess you are wrestling with 
the term "metrosexual?"  If not, I'm completely lost here.

The term was invented by Mark Simpson, "Here come the mirror men," The 
Independent, November 15, 1994.  Then his 2002 Salon article threw is all 
over the place.

Who is a metrosexual?  Mark Simpson in the 2002 Salon article cited above 
offers this definition:

"The typical metrosexual is a young man with money to spend, living in or 
within easy reach of a metropolis ­ because that's where all the best 
shops, clubs, gyms and hairdressers are. He might be officially gay, 
straight or bisexual, but this is utterly immaterial because he has clearly 
taken himself as his own love object and pleasure as his sexual preference. 
Particular professions, such as modeling, waiting tables, media, pop music 
and, nowadays, sport, seem to attract them but, truth be told, like male 
vanity products and herpes, they're pretty much everywhere.
­Mark Simpson, "Meet the metrosexual," Salon.com, July 22, 2002 "

What does it all mean? :-$  Freedom, I guess, for newly empowered urban men 
(hate that fuckin' term empowered) to use facial creams, hair products, and 
envelope themselves in Diesel, Prada and the like |-O  Much like the 
seventies, I guess.  But back then you knew the boys who used Vaseline...

Love,

Apollo

The Vice Lords of the Replacement Economies

How the Drug War and the Prison-Industrial Complex connect in a vicious 
cycle of violence, vice, and profit.

by Charles Shaw
February 1, 2005

"In war, truth is the first casualty."
- Aeschylus



In the United States government's "War on Drugs", the rules are simple 
enough to grasp. Since drugs are bad for you, foster crime, and destroy 
people's lives, they are illegal, and those that are involved with them are 
criminals who belong in jail. In this paradigm, drug dealers are violent 
and dangerous, and despite the emergence of a recovery culture, addicts are 
still considered morally bankrupt "others". Removing these elements from 
the streets is generally considered a good thing, and whatever it takes to 
accomplish this, even if it means bending the Constitution, should be 
encouraged and permitted in the interest of our general safety and well being.

Every day Americans have these views reinforced by elected officials, the 
corporate media, and a pervading culture of addiction that is hardly 
limited to these denizens of society, but rather infiltrates millions of 
American lives. Everywhere you turn, people are warning you of the dangers 
of some drugs, while pushing others relentlessly. Everywhere you go, 
someone has a story of how addiction or violence ruined someone close to them.

And most people end up thinking , Isn't it wonderful of our Government to 
try and protect us.

Hmmmm- MetroMichael asked me repeatedly to come "adjust his antenna" after
you "plugged in his router"- apparently you didn't know what you were
doing handling such things.  Then he gave me some green dragon and the

Subject: [sfraves] A Fine Hole


A Fine Hole

i.

Its too bad we like each other.

We people
its too bad we *like* so much.

We destroy ourselves.
Its too bad we dont keep each other around.


January 1991, for example:  
Mac popped out of the hatch of the tank.

That sandnigger didnt want no fight.
Hands held high to Iraqi skies,
But missing the point.

Mac opened up a fine hole in that sandnigger.

Mac understood--
We must destroy ourselves.

We cheered him--- Mac!  Our homecoming hero.
But we never mentioned the sandnigger.

That round was meant for piercing tanks,
But it made a fine hole.

It made a fine hole.


ii.

We peopleas twos:
We last nine months,
Or 84, if were lucky enough
To replicate and raise dumb monkeys like us.
 
We fuck, 
We birth invisible babies.
We dust away
Then We are dead.

Then you, then me
We dust apart.
We dust apart,

Apart.  Apart.
We dust apart.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] *METRO* begins this Sunday... (nrr)

Yeah I can't really be metro: I spend about $150 total on clothes every
year, cut my own hair, wear no accessories, have no facial mousterizers, and
basically pick everything I do and wear so that it takes as little
time/thought as possible while still coordinating (buzz cut so no combing,
all dark colored clothes so no worrying about mismatching, etc.).  Stickman
beats me 10x over, I have clothes, he has "outfits".  :)  George is
definitely picking up the pace this year though (you so style you hurt my
eyes!), and R.y.a.n. passes because of his graphic design super picky
sensibility and constantly changing uber cool hair.  And Dave?  Dave is
grate!

NRR > Need people to beta test our new online 448bit encryption data storage
client/server. 

What I am looking for is people/businesses to use our backup client/server,
u/l and archive offsite your pictures, personal works, mp3 or whatever you
desire. 

We are in final stages (pre-launch) and the marketing is just about to
begin. I would like user feedback on how easy the client setup is,
Configuration, 
usability etc. The service is geared more towards SOHO (Small Office / Home
Office) as the client is EXTREMLY ADVACNED and has many options
 that the average non-technical person may not completely grasp.

If you would like to be part of the pilot program, please email me privately
the following information :

1. username
2. password (Minimum 8 characters)
3. your full name, address, phone numbers (This info is needed in order to
send you a restore CD's, DVD's, USB Hard Drive)
4. The amount of space you need (In giga bites)
5. Your internet upload / download connection speed (You can get this info
from www.SpeedTest.com)

The current client only runs on Microsoft at this time. Future
Mac/Unix/Linux clients will be available in the coming months.

We currently have active the following levels of encryption enabled : 

Secure Blowfish
Triple DES
DES

Thanks in advance,
Matt

month sublet. We are currently communal with food (although food share
for the sublet can be negotiated) and bills (PGE, cable internet,
garbage), organic and vegetarian.

The Space: six bedrooms (because the space is HUGE and has 2 floors 6
bedrooms is not at all overwhelming), 1 bath/shower room, 2 toilets,
kitchen, 2 communal spaces (one of which is a huge work/creative space,
the other entertainment - though we are a No TV household, we do watch
movies) 2 balconies, one spiral staircase, and lots of sunlight.

include: a dj, student, couples therapist, dominatrix, website designer,
artist/performers of various medium, and more...

location: outer mission, close to muni, bus, BART, highway
also near all sorts of restaurants, grocery, etc.

cost: $621/month utilities/food (see above) not included

yea.  uh-huh.  life does that.  the street i'm on here in virginia sort

was driving around the other day and this guy in his range rover,

wants to turn his nose up at it, but can't.

Cheeba Hut!  oh my - i remember that place... uh, vaguely, anyway.

Hit up Haji Baba - excellent middle eastern food.  They're at 1513 East 
Apache... just follow Mill Ave south, past the curve around ASU, then 
about 2 miles down the road. it's in a strip mall on the right.

I left Phoenix (well, Tempe, actually), cuz I couldn't find decent 
restaurants or produce.

I have to agree with Jessi - the parties and clubs there are lame. 
There was some cool stuff going on when i lived there, but that was 6 
years ago.

Hi all! below is a link for my latest mix. Please listen to it and tell what style you think it is. Labels are often confusing. I would call the style of this mix trance, but it doesn't sound like what most people these days would call trance. I think most people would probably say it's progressive house or progressive something or other. Also let me know what setting you think would best suit this style. Thanks.

damn, dawg, when I werked on California and Sansome a block from the

Waters, with his Dominiatrix g/f, Leticia, (many a night a heard thru
the walls the sound of a cat o' nine tails making impact, with the
attendant sounds of, whatever), his Arch-Enemy, a wine dealer named
Mike Hunt, I am not making this up, and, man was that ever a good

I'd be all over this set-up of yours, if i dinn't have a cozy lil
situation of my own that's, well, 3,000 fucking billion miles away,
sounds like you've got the situation of a lifetime over there.

I can vouch for your character and all, and if there's anyone out
there in sfraves land that's in need of a place to hang their hat,
they could do a whole fuck of alot werse.

that's one ravers opinion, take it for what it's werth.

Anyone know the origin of the term "cheeba"?  I have
an old jazz record by George Benson caleed Erotic
Moods on which he discusses "Smoking Cheeba Cheeba" 
I've always assumed it was marijuana...

Subject: [sfraves] art in Bagdad

they say suffering gives birth to the best works of
art.  

The paintbrush is mightier than the M60-A1 with
depleted uranium armor-piercing shells.  Or something.

  Baghdad's blast wall art
  By Roger Hearing


  In a dull Baghdad world of concrete and razor-wire,
chicanes and blast barriers, a little colour has just
re-appeared.

  Every official building or media base these days has
a frontage of four-metre (13ft) high concrete walls to
protect against bombs and 
mortars, but Iraqis have begun to see the grey expanse
as a public canvas.

  There is of course graffiti, but mostly great
swirling apolitical exuberance - everything from
retro-Chagall to prog-rock album-cover teenage
fantasies.

  Outside the French embassy, just two doors down from
the BBC bureau, there is a profusion of images - wild
horses, flying carpets, impossible towers and
minarets, as well as a simple scene of an Iraqi farmer
in a tractor coming back to his wife and children at
the close of the day.

  On almost every section there is a dove - the symbol
of a peace Iraqis do not yet know.

  Academic approach

The Reuters news agency's building has a pattern of
flowers and Iraqi flags, and next door has some
attempts at what seems to be vaguely-remembered
Picassos.

  And the BBC's house? Well I have to say, it is
impressive.

  A professor of fine art was called in, I was told,
and he produced, over many weeks, an elaborate tribute
to the ancient history of his people across the
fortifications of our building.

  Angular, bearded Assyrian heads mingle with Sumerian
ziggurats, Babylonian chariots and visions of rulers
and wars long past - perhaps 
an aide-memoire that this country has been through
difficult times before. And survived.

  Elsewhere in the city, security means glimpses of
the art generally have to be snatched through
curtained windows of our minivan - but the 
pattern of current popular expression all over Baghdad
seems to be much the same - history or fantasy.

  Saddam's many guises

As long as I have been coming here, there has been
plenty of public art. In the past, however, there was
one subject - Saddam Hussein.

  Saddam in many guises - as Western playboy, as Arab
sheikh, even on one occasion as a Kremlin communist
complete with fur hat, but always 
Saddam, displayed on huge hoardings around the city
squares.

  And always depicted in the heroic socialist-realism
style dictators seem to favour.

  They have all gone of course, and with them any
feeling of artistic restriction, apparently.

  All is possible now it seems - even if the blast
walls that have become the artists' gallery are things
most Iraqis would sooner be without.

Subject: [sfraves] The FURIOUS2 Ride Home w/ Dina! PT2

OK.. sorry 4 the lag.. i been hella busy w/ school this week & didn't like
i dunno.. lame... but well.. I shall continue this journey!!!

OK... so a Chicken runs out of the the door as soon as we open it up &
peek!!  We look all around the club & see nothing but animals
everywhere!!!  Chickens, Cows, 2 horses, a few snakes, a fish tank full of
lobsters & crabs, I mean.. seriously.. there was a farm of animals in The
White Horse... As soon as we walked through the door, this tall scary dude
dressed up in farm clothes handed up happy face iron branders (I think
that's what they're called) & told us that it was an after hours branding
party!  Hmmm... interesting!

So there was like this Disco Diva Vocal House music playing @ White Horse
& like all these gay Dudes like danicing around w/ all these branding
irons in there hands & all these animals in the club.. it was kinda freaky
'cause like well... they were branding every kinda animal in the club...
the horses, chickens, there was a pissed off tied up bull in the corner
that had like 7-8 happy faces branded on it...  It was ummm..
interesting...

So Dina went off 2 dance w/ some gay boys onthe dance floor & me & Terri
got Cokes @ the bar & walked around... then we ended up in a line to heat
up our branding irons 2 mark an animal... it was weird... but yeah... I
ened up branding a pig & Terri ended up branding a Zebra!!!  I dunno.. I
felt so weird like after that just holding that iron thingie, so I gave it
back 2 the scary farmer dude & Terri did also!  then we joined Dina on the
Dancefloor & we all boogied down 2 that "Electric Avenue" remake song...
it was fun!!

We were like dancing 4 a few more minutes, then the doors busted open &
these Cops appeared w/ guns & stuff!!!  As soon as they walked in, ALL the
animals ran out of the club!!  Luckily, earlier Dina threw her iron across
the club when she accidentally branded some Italian Hella Tall Beau Hunk's
ass which kinda caused that Italian dude 2 throw his iron also.  So we
grabbed Dina & the Tall Italian Beau Hunk & we casually looked like we
were walking to the bar even though the police told us 2 stand still! Then
while the police were turned around.. we tip toes reeeeeeally fast to the
door & ran to the car!!

It was kinda a hard run 'cause well... Terri was wearing red & the red was
pissin' the bull off (OHMYGOODNESS, OH MY GOSH, HELLO 2DAY, REDBULL, I get
it now!) so she had 2 run around the block w/ a few other animals to lose
the bull while we waited in the car...

"Oh Shit.. we still have to get our Burgers Dina!!!" I yelled as I ran out
the cars 2 the burger joint & got our food!!  Then I hoped back in the
back seat  of the car & Dina started driving around the block looking for
Terri & the Tell Italian Beau Hunk... we saw them & they ran up & hopped
in the car... the Bull wasn't too far from them, & we drove off!!  We were
drivin' down Ashby & there were still alota animals running...

We finally got 2 the the 80 enter freeway road thingie & drove all the way
strait up....

"Osby..." Terri began 2 say "... I think we sould just all head out 2
Dina's Mom boat house in Crockett & we'll bring U home 2morrow!  I think
we all need 2 like totally chill out from all that shit we just been
through, ya know?"

"Yeah, I was gonna say same thing Terri!!" I said.

"Aawzbiiie is jer nam?" the Tall Italian Beau Hunk started to say to me!

"Yeah dude... what's your name man?" I asked as we shook hands!

"Antonio!" he said.  "Me anglais is eeeh, not good."

"Naw man.. it all Groovy man!  So U don't mind hangin' out w/ us crazy
people?  Ummm... do you know what 'Ravers' are?" I asked.

"No, me glad to be wiv you peple!" he said as I felt this strong squeeze
on my thigh!!!

"HELLO 2DAY!!!" I shouldted as every1 in the Divafly mobile started laughing!

We got 2 the boathouse in crockett & went inside!!  We all sat in the
kitchen w/ the burgers &, fries & drinks.  then Terri Looked in the
fridge.

"Uuuuuh, guys, are we like really that hungry???  There's hella CRAB in
here!" Terri Said!

So we feasted on Burgers, Fries, & Crab while the Antonio gave us a strip
show to 1 of Dina's CDs her Mom had on the boat!

We all went 2 sleep & woke up around around 2-3!  they drove me home
shortly after that w/ Antonio & they came insode the house w/ me 'cause
Terri hd to go use the bathroom!

The 1st thing my mom said when she saw me was, "Howcome you have chicken
feathers in your hair?"

there's nothing quite like partying at 2 am in 100 degree heat - and 
that's the OUTSIDE temperature.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] *METRO* begins this Sunday... (nrr)

Hahaha. Why is it that being a graphic designer makes me metro? I'd
say I'm metro only  because I adopted the gay bitchy attitude from
some gay friends of mine a long time ago. I took it to a new level
though. Much like andrew I don't spend shit on clothes. Hell Stacey 
has bought most of my clothes recently because of that. I'd rather
spend money on drinking. Yes. Feed me more licker. Naa I'm kinda
kidding, but really I guess my graphic designer picky sensibility
makes me a prime candidate since I deal in image. Whatever works. If I
look good that's something I'm not going to complain about. Hell - I
just got Jason (dk//white.rabbit) to cut his hair and get rid of the
long skater cut finally. Even to use hair product and he looks really
fucking good now. He wasn't so sure about things at first  but now
that he's getting a lot of good feedback as to the new look he's
feeling a lot better about himself.

I'm babbling. Basically if you live in SF and go out at all in the
club scene you're fucking metro. It's all relative, but SF people like
us really just are inherently a bit more progressive like that and
it's in our nature.

Ethiopan Capital Celebrates Bob Marley's Birthday

By MARC LACEY

A
DDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, Feb. 6 - If he had been on stage, Bob Marley would 
have waved his graying dreadlocks in the air and beseeched black people to 
continue struggling. In that lilting voice of his, he would have sung of 
love, of unity, of his beloved Ethiopia.

But Marley was only a memory, albeit a powerful one, at his 60th-birthday 
celebration today in the sprawling central square of the Ethiopian capital. 
So his wife, Rita, his sons, including Ziggy Marley, and numerous other 
admirers did the singing for the late reggae great, as tens of thousands of 
people jumped and gyrated to his trademark beat at a daylong concert titled 
"Africa Unite." Also performing were the singers Lauryn Hill, formerly of 
the Fugees; Angélique Kidjo from Benin; drummers from Burundi; and 
Ethiopian entertainers singing their versions of reggae.

It was a curious scene. Meskel Square, the spot where giant portraits of 
Marx and Lenin looked down on Ethiopians during the country's communist 
days, was decorated with likenesses of Marley. Among the revelers were 
beggars, prevailing on all the idealists to give them something to eat.

Ethiopia is regarded as the promised land for Rastafarians, the dreadlocked 
Jamaican spiritualists who gave Marley so much of his inspiration. That 
special status comes despite the poverty of the place, the regular bouts of 
starvation, the sicknesses that fell so many Ethiopians. Indeed, many here 
mock the Rastas.

Nearly a quarter of a century after Marley's death, Rastas and other reggae 
lovers have flocked here from all over the world to remember him and his 
powerful litany of lyrics. The Marley fans came from Jamaica, the 
birthplace of Rastafarianism, and from other countries that have fallen 
under reggae's spell. Besides celebrating, one of the goals of the 
gathering was to win over the many people in this conservative Christian 
and Muslim country who view Rastas with deep suspicion. The concert was 
organized by the Bob and Rita Marley Foundation, a philanthropic group that 
works in Ethiopia. It was the first time that the birthday festivities had 
been held outside of Jamaica since Marley died of cancer at 36 in 1981.

The Ethiopian government sanctioned the concert because it saw the influx 
of so many visitors as an economic boon. But the arrival of the Rastas was 
unnerving for some locals, who have trouble grappling with their marijuana 
use and the belief among many of them that Haile Selassie, the country's 
deposed emperor, was more deity than man.

"This is our pilgrimage country," said a man who calls himself Jah Eliejah 
Adanjah, an aging Rasta from the Caribbean island of Guadalupe who was 
setting foot on Ethiopian soil for the first time. "The feeling is so 
strong that I can't find words to express it."

Marley's widow, Rita, gave an indication of the deep ties Rastas feel 
toward Ethiopia when she said last month that she planned to dig up the 
singer's remains in Jamaica one day and rebury them in his spiritual home 
of Africa. Her remarks drew fierce criticism in Jamaica, Marley's 
birthplace, but she said it had been her husband's lifelong wish to reach 
the promised land.

In the raucous crowd of revelers were some Japanese Rastas, who said that 
Marley's message of black empowerment appeals to anybody who is rebellious 
inside. "I feel the songs as much as anyone else," said Chihiro Nakamori, 
25, of Kyoto, who had fledgling dreadlocks hanging from his head. "When I 
smoke the herb, I connect with another world." Rastafarians believe that 
smoking marijuana is a sacrament sanctioned by the Bible.

There were Ethiopian Rastas, as well, young people in dreadlocks who said 
Marley's music spoke to them but that some Rasta beliefs did not. One group 
of them chewed khat, a popular stimulant here, instead of smoking marijuana.

Rastas named their movement after Haile Selassie, who was known as Ras 
Tafari before becoming Ethiopia's emperor in 1930. The movement, which came 
of age at a time when Africa was under white rule, deified Selassie, a 
black emperor who symbolized an independent Africa. Ethiopians are 
extremely divided on the merits of Selassie, a man who lifted the country's 
image on the international stage but ruled in an authoritarian manner.

Before he was deposed in 1974, and murdered the following year, Selassie 
set aside land for those in the black diaspora who sought to help develop 
Ethiopia. Hundreds of Rastas responded and settled in the remote village of 
Shashemene, where they continue to worship him.

But the presence of Rastas in their midst has not calmed the concerns of 
some Ethiopians, who see the way of life of Rastafarians as a bad influence 
for their children. "There's a hidden agenda here," said Dr. Henok G. 
Hiwot, an Ethiopian who speaks to parents about dangers young people face 
if they adopt a Rastafarian way of life: "This is a Bob Marley celebration, 
but we fear they're trying to attract Ethiopians to their culture. We don't 
want that."

Critics of Rastafarianism had a message for the many visitors: find another 
promised land.

During the concert, members of various Protestant churches slipped quietly 
through the crowd handing out pamphlets that attacked the deification of 
Selassie by Rastafarians. It was a risky enterprise, as the authorities had 
detained eight young people who were caught with the pamphlets on eve of 
the concert that the government had endorsed.

Many, though, saw no harm. Abuna Paulos, the patriarch of the influential 
Ethiopian Orthodox Church, of which Selassie and later Marley were members, 
delivered the celebration's opening prayer. "The church's task is to preach 
any time to anyone, no matter their hairstyle," said the gray-bearded 
patriarch, calling Marley his "spiritual son."

At scholarly discussions leading up to the concert, Marley's lyrics were 
deconstructed and applied to present-day problems. Azeb Mesfin, the wife of 
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, spoke of how the Marley hit "No Woman, No Cry" 
inspires struggling women in Africa. When it comes to AIDS, which is taking 
the lives of so many Africans, she referred to another Marley song: "We 
should 'get up, stand up' and defeat this terrible scourge," she said.

The revelers who turned out in the beating sun to soak up Marley's music 
were similarly adapting the lyrics to their own lives. Wouhib Bayou, 29, an 
Ethiopian who says he finds most Rasta ideology compatible with his Muslim 
beliefs, said "Waiting in Vain," one of Marley's love songs, perfectly 
captured his frustration with Ethiopia.

"When you see other countries on TV and you see how advanced they are, you 
long for that kind of wealth," he said. "I'm waiting for that right here in 
Ethiopia, but I'm waiting in vain."

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

singers Lauryn Hill, formerly of the Fugees; Angélique Kidjo from Benin;
drummers from Burundi; and Ethiopian entertainers singing their versions
of reggae.<br><br>
It was a curious scene. Meskel Square, the spot where giant portraits of
Marx and Lenin looked down on Ethiopians during the country's communist
days, was decorated with likenesses of Marley. Among the revelers were
beggars, prevailing on all the idealists to give them something to
eat.<br><br>
Ethiopia is regarded as the promised land for Rastafarians, the
dreadlocked Jamaican spiritualists who gave Marley so much of his
inspiration. That special status comes despite the poverty of the place,
the regular bouts of starvation, the sicknesses that fell so many
Ethiopians. Indeed, many here mock the Rastas.<br><br>
Nearly a quarter of a century after Marley's death, Rastas and other
reggae lovers have flocked here from all over the world to remember him
and his powerful litany of lyrics. The Marley fans came from Jamaica, the
birthplace of Rastafarianism, and from other countries that have fallen
under reggae's spell. Besides celebrating, one of the goals of the
gathering was to win over the many people in this conservative Christian
and Muslim country who view Rastas with deep suspicion. The concert was
organized by the Bob and Rita Marley Foundation, a philanthropic group
that works in Ethiopia. It was the first time that the birthday
festivities had been held outside of Jamaica since Marley died of cancer
at 36 in 1981. <br><br>
The Ethiopian government sanctioned the concert because it saw the influx
of so many visitors as an economic boon. But the arrival of the Rastas
was unnerving for some locals, who have trouble grappling with their
marijuana use and the belief among many of them that Haile Selassie, the
country's deposed emperor, was more deity than man.<br><br>
&quot;This is our pilgrimage country,&quot; said a man who calls himself
Jah Eliejah Adanjah, an aging Rasta from the Caribbean island of
Guadalupe who was setting foot on Ethiopian soil for the first time.
&quot;The feeling is so strong that I can't find words to express
it.&quot;<br><br>
Marley's widow, Rita, gave an indication of the deep ties Rastas feel
toward Ethiopia when she said last month that she planned to dig up the
singer's remains in Jamaica one day and rebury them in his spiritual home
of Africa. Her remarks drew fierce criticism in Jamaica, Marley's
birthplace, but she said it had been her husband's lifelong wish to reach
the promised land.<br><br>
In the raucous crowd of revelers were some Japanese Rastas, who said that
Marley's message of black empowerment appeals to anybody who is
rebellious inside. &quot;I feel the songs as much as anyone else,&quot;
said Chihiro Nakamori, 25, of Kyoto, who had fledgling dreadlocks hanging
from his head. &quot;When I smoke the herb, I connect with another
world.&quot; Rastafarians believe that smoking marijuana is a sacrament
sanctioned by the Bible.<br><br>
There were Ethiopian Rastas, as well, young people in dreadlocks who said
Marley's music spoke to them but that some Rasta beliefs did not. One
group of them chewed khat, a popular stimulant here, instead of smoking
marijuana.<br><br>
Rastas named their movement after Haile Selassie, who was known as Ras
Tafari before becoming Ethiopia's emperor in 1930. The movement, which
came of age at a time when Africa was under white rule, deified Selassie,
a black emperor who symbolized an independent Africa. Ethiopians are
extremely divided on the merits of Selassie, a man who lifted the
country's image on the international stage but ruled in an authoritarian
manner.<br><br>
Before he was deposed in 1974, and murdered the following year, Selassie
set aside land for those in the black diaspora who sought to help develop
Ethiopia. Hundreds of Rastas responded and settled in the remote village
of Shashemene, where they continue to worship him.<br><br>
But the presence of Rastas in their midst has not calmed the concerns of
some Ethiopians, who see the way of life of Rastafarians as a bad
influence for their children. &quot;There's a hidden agenda here,&quot;
said Dr. Henok G. Hiwot, an Ethiopian who speaks to parents about dangers
young people face if they adopt a Rastafarian way of life: &quot;This is
a Bob Marley celebration, but we fear they're trying to attract
Ethiopians to their culture. We don't want that.&quot;<br><br>
Critics of Rastafarianism had a message for the many visitors: find
another promised land.<br><br>
During the concert, members of various Protestant churches slipped
quietly through the crowd handing out pamphlets that attacked the
deification of Selassie by Rastafarians. It was a risky enterprise, as
the authorities had detained eight young people who were caught with the
pamphlets on eve of the concert that the government had endorsed.
<br><br>
Many, though, saw no harm. Abuna Paulos, the patriarch of the influential
Ethiopian Orthodox Church, of which Selassie and later Marley were
members, delivered the celebration's opening prayer. &quot;The church's
task is to preach any time to anyone, no matter their hairstyle,&quot;
said the gray-bearded patriarch, calling Marley his &quot;spiritual
son.&quot;<br><br>
At scholarly discussions leading up to the concert, Marley's lyrics were
deconstructed and applied to present-day problems. Azeb Mesfin, the wife
of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, spoke of how the Marley hit &quot;No
Woman, No Cry&quot; inspires struggling women in Africa. When it comes to
AIDS, which is taking the lives of so many Africans, she referred to
another Marley song: &quot;We should 'get up, stand up' and defeat this
terrible scourge,&quot; she said.<br><br>
The revelers who turned out in the beating sun to soak up Marley's music
were similarly adapting the lyrics to their own lives. Wouhib Bayou, 29,
an Ethiopian who says he finds most Rasta ideology compatible with his
Muslim beliefs, said &quot;Waiting in Vain,&quot; one of Marley's love
songs, perfectly captured his frustration with Ethiopia.<br><br>
&quot;When you see other countries on TV and you see how advanced they
are, you long for that kind of wealth,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm waiting
for that right here in Ethiopia, but I'm waiting in vain.&quot;<br><br>

  Ethiopan Capital Celebrates Bob Marley's Birthday
  By MARC LACEY=20

   DDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, Feb. 6 - If he had been on stage, Bob Marley =
would have waved his graying dreadlocks in the air and beseeched black =
people to continue struggling. In that lilting voice of his, he would =
have sung of love, of unity, of his beloved Ethiopia.

  But Marley was only a memory, albeit a powerful one, at his =
60th-birthday celebration today in the sprawling central square of the =
Ethiopian capital. So his wife, Rita, his sons, including Ziggy Marley, =
and numerous other admirers did the singing for the late reggae great, =
as tens of thousands of people jumped and gyrated to his trademark beat =
at a daylong concert titled "Africa Unite." Also performing were the =
singers Lauryn Hill, formerly of the Fugees; Ang=E9lique Kidjo from =
Benin; drummers from Burundi; and Ethiopian entertainers singing their =
versions of reggae.

  It was a curious scene. Meskel Square, the spot where giant portraits =
of Marx and Lenin looked down on Ethiopians during the country's =
communist days, was decorated with likenesses of Marley. Among the =
revelers were beggars, prevailing on all the idealists to give them =
something to eat.

Yet another song with a chainsaw sample in it.

I'm not into hard trance, but this song is a great exception when played
loud.

"They blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat
And it's hard to compete
When they're smiling with your heart in their teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath"

you assumed correctly.

me likes Phoenix -- much to appreciate there. if Swell Records was
located in the Bay Area I'd probably own more trance than breaks --
truly awesome hard trance selection. most of the hard trance I have
hidden away comes from Swell.

didn't see too much of the scene there, I was only there about a
month, but what I saw I liked. definitely seemed more ravey than
clubby, but then I generally pay more attention to raves than to clubs
in the first place.

G/F & I are driving down to Monterey where we're going to hook up with another couple. Dude from other couple gets the hookup on free rental SUV's. From there, we hotbox down to Indio or wherever the fuck the middle nowhere is, consume alcohol-poisoned water till we get arrested, and check out the show if we get bailed out in time. Might have an extra seat or two for anyone that wants to throw down on gas & lodge.

Cocteau Twins. Bauhaus. New Order?
Is that true?

Harken's been gazing at his shoes. 

I'll challenge a water-drinking contest. Loser pays
the tab on gas, winner buys us tabs of acid. 

I'm up for a jaunt. Who knows how to get down to
over down there where coachella is? Over there. 
Behind your derriere.

Harken drives.

Subject: [sfraves] Why North America Is Not a Rhythm Nation

I got rhythm,
I got music.
I got my guy,
Who could ask for anything more?
- George Gershwin/Ira Gershwin

North American adults have problems perceiving and reproducing
irregular rhythms. That's what past studies have shown, and some
new research has addressed the question of whether our seeming
inability to dance to a different tune should be chalked up to
nature or culture. New findings point to a harmonious blend of
both.

Music has a communal quality in virtually all cultures, inspiring
dancing, clapping, instrument playing, marching, and chanting.
Despite what seems to be a universal to coordinate movement,
listeners are frequently challenged by the rhythmic patterns of
other cultures. North American adults, for example, have difficulty
perceiving rhythmic patterns in Balkan music.

Erin E. Hannon, Cornell University, and Sandra Trehub, University
of Toronto, found that Bulgarian and Macedonian adults process
complex musical rhythms better than North American adults, who
often struggle with anything other than simple western meter. To
gauge the significance of culture influences our ability to process
musical patterns, the researchers also conducted experiments with
North American infants and found that they too were better than
North American adults.

It's ravey in the clubs. Progressive house is really progressive
trance and more like just trance. The scene is young and the young
kids love their trance. Lots of breaks out here too. I saw that record
store the other day. Didn't go in though.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Why North America Is Not a Rhythm Nation

OK, that's it- if I have children, I'm going to put on a constant
soundtrack of 20th (21st?) century classical, free jazz, and math rock.
 I probably would have anyhow just to get that extra wiring installed
early (along with Douglas Adams stuff for bedtime story material), but
this is just further reason :)

It's the only responsible thing to do.

I can't seem to source what driver they're using exactly, but chances
are it's an Eminence (or, I guess, some custom jbl thing), and if it's
a neodymium, it may be this driver:

Priced at $179 there.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Mariano on An Epiphany of Sound Thur.

On a quest to help bring about a revival of the PsyTrance scene in San
Francisco, ex KZSU-er DJ Mariano will make a return appearance on An
Epiphany of Sound this Thur., 2/10, from 9a-noon.  He's been DJing since
he was only 17, so you know he can bring it to you like you like it,
with musicians like Psycat, Infected Mushrooom, producers from Medium
records and more.  He's all about making you wanna dance!!  (Just don't
try doing it while you're driving.)

Listen in at 90.1 FM in the bay area and online at
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu between 9a and noon this Thur.  We'll also
be giving away CDs and tickets to the Gravity CD Release party from
Artemis this Fri. as well as more stuff!

Peace.

There is a Donald Glaude mix in which this track states "I'm a Cheeba".. but
I don't know what it means.. it is a pretty cool mix though.. I will see if
I can dig it up :)

"They blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat
And it's hard to compete
When they're smiling with your heart in their teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath"

you assumed correctly.

me likes Phoenix -- much to appreciate there. if Swell Records was
located in the Bay Area I'd probably own more trance than breaks --
truly awesome hard trance selection. most of the hard trance I have
hidden away comes from Swell.

didn't see too much of the scene there, I was only there about a
month, but what I saw I liked. definitely seemed more ravey than
clubby, but then I generally pay more attention to raves than to clubs
in the first place.

Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit....I predict loads of tasty breaktasticness, and 
some chunky techno to spice things up.

I can only speak for myself when I say, it's gonna get DIRTY @ DIRTY. 
Expect some lowdown, ass shakin' funk from me...

Fo sheezy.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: A funny thing happened yesterday...


A funny thing happened yesterday. I started working on a client site in 
San Mateo last month. Low and behold, going through the company directory 
I see a name that I am quite familiar with: my predecessor :)

The name in the email directory was: dhchung

So just out of curiousity, I walked through the engineering department to 
see if my hunch was correct, and sure enough, it was!

Derek Chung is working on site at the same client I am! What a small 
world.

It is really nice to see him, I haven't seen him since the SFR 10 Year 
Anniversary in 2002.

For those who didn't know, Derek did the calendar before myself and 
after Brian Behlendorf.

I want to say thanks to Derek for all of his efforts implementing the 
gencal.cgi version of the calendar, the years of his service to running 
the SFR calendar, and eventually passing it off to me in November 1998. 
Much love to the SFR community.

It's a small world afterall.

Karina

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  More Metro

--=====================_25019165==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The recent discussion here of the Metro was followed by a request, on 
MySpace, to be added by "Metrosexual" as a "friend."  Now I don't know 
"Metrosexual".....or do I?  No matter.  He is a sort of composite, as it were.

Anyhow "Metrosexual" has described himself in some detail on his MySpace 
profile and I thought I share for edutainment purposes.  Think I should 
"add" him?

Love,

Apollo


Metrosexual's Interests:


General <http://www.myspace.com/#>His intrests are dating, 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>wine tasting, <http://www.myspace.com/#>poetry 
reading even if he doesn't understand it. <http://www.myspace.com/#>Going 
to the theater, <http://www.myspace.com/#>seeing art films and professing 
his love of children.

Music <http://www.myspace.com/#>The metro will generally say he enjoys all 
forms of music so as to cover his bases. <http://www.myspace.com/#>In his 
IPOD you will see everything from Al Green to Green Day. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>The phantom of the opera to Fugazi. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>Dido to Tupac. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>Metallica to Mozart. <http://www.myspace.com/#>He 
will know only two lines to each song, <http://www.myspace.com/#>but will 
make you fully aware he knows those two lines just so you believe him to be 
a connoisseur of music. <http://www.myspace.com/#>Just don't ask him to 
spell connoisseur

Movies <http://www.myspace.com/#>The metros movie collection will be vast 
and extensive. <http://www.myspace.com/#>With the advent of the DVD he has 
a new way of showing just how cool he is by owning all of your favorite 
movies, <http://www.myspace.com/#>because he owns every movie. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>Inside you will find every Pacino and DeNiro 
film. <http://www.myspace.com/#>He will profess his love of gangster movies 
while he sits home at 1 p.<http://www.myspace.com/#>m. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>on a sunday afternoon after football season and 
watches Finding Nemo. <http://www.myspace.com/#>He will own all 100 movies 
on the American Film Institutes top 100 list, <http://www.myspace.com/#>but 
will only enjoy 4 of them. <http://www.myspace.com/#>The metros "private 
movie" collection will be stored safely away so as not to inhibit his 
"caring and sensitive" side. <http://www.myspace.com/#>However, 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>ladies, <http://www.myspace.com/#>you will be 
secretly videotaped because the metro knows there's a good chance he'll be 
alone at age 50 and need something to look back on.

Television <http://www.myspace.com/#>The simpson and Family Guy. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>And all sporting events. 
<http://www.myspace.com/#>Conan O'Brien and the Daily Show as well are 
required viewing.

Books <http://www.myspace.com/#>His books are magazines.

Heroes <http://www.myspace.com/#>Derek Zoolander.

Makeout

About me:

The Metro is generally kind and accepting. He will not spend more time than 
his girlfriend in the bathroom, but will spend the exact same amount of 
time, regardless of hair length. He will only date the *trophy* girlfriend, 
however he will "slum it" with a fuck buddy. Point of fact, the trophy 
girlfriend has a wide range of beauty. Most will be the superficial club 
queen who looks like her makeup has been applied by a shotgun and the 
streaks in her hair look like lane markers on a highway. Essential reading 
for him is GQ, Esquire, Maxim, Stuff, Blender, Entertainment Weekly, US 
weekly, The Wall Street Journal, and CNN.com. He will max out his credit 
cards buying clothing for himself and drinks for his friends. He will spend 
entire paychecks to impress a girl he's trying to date. He will constantly 
ask for reassurance but insist he doesn't need it. He's not gay but will 
have a list of five guys he'd screw, but they have to be a "Guy's Guy". 
Most popular choices are Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, Billy Bob Thornton, Tom 
Ford, George Clooney, Johnny Depp, Becks, Freddie Ljunberg, Hugh Grant, 
Clive Owen, Alex Rodriguez and Michael Jordan. If you ask him to name his 
top five designers they will be Versace, Armani, Gucci, Prada and Cavalli. 
The majority of his wardrobe will be from Banana Republic or H&M, however 
when he does bust out an item from one of his fave designers everyone in 
the room will know about it and how much he paid for it. The label will be 
proudly displayed at all times. He will spend an entire day watching a 
"Queer Eye" marathon. He more than likely has a pair of socks that costs 
over 25 dollars, for when he wants to feel special. He will routinely spend 
over 100 dollars per month on skincare products, which does not include 
getting facials. Also he will probably drive a 3 series BMW, a lower class 
Mercedes, or an Audi A4. All will be purchased used but they will swear 
they've been the only owner if you just meet them. He will also own a 
blackberry and an IPOD as well as have every cable station hooked into his 
50" plasma tv and his eight thousand dollar surround system that he had to 
spend four days learning to operate. Nails will be kept clean and 
maintained at all times as well as hair and breath. He will also mention 
from time to time that he is having a fat day and will need to be at the 
gym for the next two weeks 24/7. While in the locker room at the gym he 
will check out every penis available to see if he actually has any worth, 
since the metros penis size is directly proportional to the amount of 
material possessions he has. Once again, this is out of metro curiosity, 
not homo happy time. If you or someone you know is a metrosexual, don't 
worry. It's ok. It's not a bad thing, enjoy them or yourself.

Whom I'd like to meet:

The Metro wants to meet anyone he can impress.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

and thanks to karina!  let's give her a round of applause, folks!

i think i subbed to the calendar back in...1998 or so.  and every week i'd 
scan the listings and try to make sense of everything.  though it wouldn't 
be until 99 that i actually went to a rave and not a club.  i think i subbed 
to the sfr list sometime in 99.

and it took me years to finally meet karina!  fun times.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: DJs, Thanks for the fun & memories of a lifetime


My ramblings FOR the DJs
I call out to you from afar.
Thank you for the music
It helps me through the hard times
The late night insomnia
Memories of the past
A boring job but the beat goes on
All life passes by and the summer is long gone
But my happy feet keep dancing in my dreams.

Greg
aka PoloRaveBoi

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: A funny thing happened yesterday...

I subbed in 2003 - but you all know that already. No big stories thus far - 
everyone I have met has been really nice here, all the parties have been at 
the very least good, and people are being really accomodating about booking 
my silly ass even though I have yet to pass out (or record) one real demo 
out here...

San Fran & The Bay Area rock ASS!

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Recommendation for internet radio stations

I have many of my own recommendations, I've asked this before and am 
always seeking something new to Bump musically through the work 
day. Does anyone here have good suggestions for internet radio stations? 
Possible genres (not limited to these) of interest are:

acidhouse, breakbeat, breaks, classical, deathcore, deep house, dnb, drum 
& bass, electro, electronica, euro dance, freestyle, gabber, garage, goa, 
goa trance, happy hardcore, hardcore, hardhouse, house, jazz, jungle, 
lounge core, progressive house, psytrance, speedcore, techno, terrorcore, 
trance, triphop.

<3 Karina

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Recommendation for internet radio stations

www.protonradio.com   has tons of different shows. Lots of prog. house - but 
my favorite is "Futurized Radio", which is a HOOOOOOT HOT HOT breakbeat 
show - they archive the previous weeks show too , so you can always hear 
whatever was on the week prior...

Werd.

SamuraiFM has some good shit too - mainly the TCR Breakbeat show.

Great funk & real-true HipHop. Didn't see it on your genre list, but it's great for while you're @ work or blazin or whatever. Good stuff.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Recommendation for internet radio stations

I just got into icebergradio.com because of their breakbeat channel. 
They have a ton of different genres they cover so you may want to poke
around the site.

breaksfm.com runs a good show from Friday through the end of the
weekend, every week.

somafm.com is great for a lot of different music.  Their groove salad
channel is the shit.

00bliss.com is a good one as well but it's hit or miss as to when
their station is up.  I end up looking for them whenever I am on in
the winamp radio search.

bassdrive is good too for dnb.  My friends that are REALLY into dnb swear by it.

Hope that helps.

What's In Popeye's Pipe?




By Dana Larsen, Cannabis Culture
Posted on February 8, 2005

Popeye is one of the world's most well-known and beloved animated 
characters. Since his creation, the pipe-puffing Popeye has become a global 
phenomenon, with millions of kids heartily munching on spinach in the hopes 
that it will make them as strong as the legendary sailor-man.

Yet is the spinach which gives Popeye his super-strength really a metaphor 
for another magical herb? Have children around the world been adoring a 
hero who is really a heavy consumer of the forbidden weed  marijuana?

The evidence is circumstantial, but it is there, and when added together it 
presents a compelling picture that, for many readers at least, Popeye's 
strength-giving spinach is meant as a clear metaphor for the miraculous 
powers of marijuana.

This theory makes me all paranoid about my old friend
Puff.  He's been serving 20+ ever since Paul copped a
plea and narked him out.    

Why must you people keep destroying my cartoon

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SRR: Recommendation for internet radio stations

My friend runs http://staticbeats.com

I highly recommend it for work or actually anytime really.  Super tasteful, 
mellow, work-friendly IDM and downtempo and generally great electronic 
music.  He's a real connoisseur and the library of music he has legally 
licensed for the webcast is massive... he's been building it up for years.  
I think he sent an email to another list the other day saying they had 
something like over 100,000 albums cleared for use on there.

As a side note, the website itself is also really robust, it's got a large 
membership and a ton of electronic music news and reviews, forums and what 
not.  The site displays playlists and current song playing, and I think 
provides options to purchase the music through various outlets like iTunes 
or Amazon if you hear something you're hyped about randomly.

i picked up a cd from mr. projectile during my brief appearance at Ptwang! 
in oakland a few weeks ago.  it's a great listen if any of you get the 
chance to grab a copy.  it's been sitting in my car since i got it and is in 
heavy rotation.

spacy, atmospheric, trippy at times.  great listening.  have enjoyed it 
lots.

Subject: [sfraves] a brief rant

quoth VanMundegaarde:
> and people are being really accomodating about booking my silly ass

> here...

It's funny, bookings seem to be inversely proportional to the number of
demos that people hand out. Of course, I haven't handed out any CDs
since Halloween and I STILL get no love. (And no, Hugger-Mugger doesn't
count as long as the same 5 people show up every week!)

Seriously though... I've been seeing some SHITTY DJs at (otherwise)
great parties for a long time now. Do these people just suck a lot of
cock, or am I THAT bad at promoting myself? I can't even seem to get my
own friends to book me anymore!

Oh yeah, and Osby: whatever the fuck happened to me being the "sexiest
house DJ"? I don't really play much house these days, but still... being
sexy's gotta count for something!

I just moved recently, so I've got a whole new perspective on my record
collection. Here's what I can offer:

- deep glitchy techno (Spectral, Sub Static, Treibstoff, Kompakt
  [Extra])
- punky electro-house and *-clash (Playhouse, Output, etc.)
- jackin' tech-house (Natural Rhythm, Swag, RZ, etc.)
- 2004-style deep tech-house (Morris Audio, Traum, etc.)
- dub-house and roots dub (mostly Burial Mix 10"s, various one-offs)
- IDM/experimental (Aphex Twin, Autechre, Lusine, Sutekh,
  Context[errior])
- late 90s-early 00s jungle (Ram Records, Virus, etc.)
- 2000-era cheesed-out clubby disco house (Deep Vision, etc.)
- early 00s deep tech-house (Visitor, Combustible, lots of French stuff)
- tribal house & tech-house (Tango, Siesta, Nighshift, Detour, et al)

Mixes and more:

yah, now I do!  Potrero Hill at the foot of the
Projects.

That was the night Derek Fieldsoe dropped his pants
and trucked across the dancefloor.   Ryan was there
with like 15 hot women as always.  Good times. Nice to
see pictures of Cousin Alex too.   Thanks for the
pics, Os.

hey V.M.

didn't you just do a DC gig in the company of Scott
Henry et al?    What up with that-- how was the party?

And did the East Coast Rave Bandits jack your gear?

Just a follow-up to that hastily-sent rant...

quoth shawn allen:

> being sexy's gotta count for something!

It's the beard, isn't it? Will somebody tell me if the beard works or
not? Am I "metro" just for caring?

And here's some more stuff I forgot to mention in my repertoire, as it
were:

- dirty minimal techno (Joel Mull, 2 Dollar Egg, Dan Bell)
- straight-up electro (Carl Finlow, Bpitch Control, Electrix)
- industrial/goth-rock (Skinny Puppy, Front 242, Front Line Assembly,
  Ministry, NIN, et al)
- 80s rock/pop (Bon Jovi, Robert Palmer, B-52s, etc.)
- a smattering of just about anything else you can think of, with the
  exception of hardcore, ghetto-tech, or country

Oh yeah, and if you're crazy enough to want to book me, call me. I don't
have net access at home now. My number's at the bottom of every email
I've sent out since, like 1999.

TTFN,

hey, last night there were 3 new people there!  me, tim and eva.  we only 
stayed for a bit.  long enough for me to have a chicken wing and a beer.  i 
believe you on the decks.  it was either you or andy's ipod.  no, it was 
you.  i liked it.  it got a little breaky electro for a bit.

and regarding bookings...yes, it's friends booking friends (come on, let's 
all admit it).  sometimes they have skills, sometimes they don't.  sometimes 
it's just cause they play trance/hardcore/jungle/house whatever.  sometimes 
djs that lack skill make up for it by actually knowing a shit load of people 
and somehow can draw people to a party.

i think it's rare that someone books someone that they don't know.  i've 
done it before, and i feel like i'm the crazy one.  or booking a DJ that i 
like...but that i'm not sure that the crowd will like or even care who they 
are.  and of course the incredible number of bay area folks who own 
turntables and enough records to get through an hour long set has continued 
to skyrocket.

with that said, someone should book shawn.  or hell, let's just get all the 
djs that haven't played out as much as they should...let's get a crew 
together and throw our own damn party!   hey, Evil Breaks  parties account 
for atleast 1/4 of all my gigs!

ho hum.

I don't know if a lot of people on sfr are familiar with Kin Records,
but if you haven't heard the Junior Boys' album "Exit" yet you're really
missing out.

Unforunately Kin's founder, Nick Kilroy, passed away yesterday. He left
us with these wonderful photos:

Got that.  And some deep house.  And some prog. breaks.  And some prog
house. And some house.  And some of the Swedes.  And some prog. trance.
And trance.  And acid (music, I'm refering to.)  And some hoover bumps.
And some chainsaw sounds.

I don't know if a lot of people on sfr are familiar with Kin Records,
but if you haven't heard the Junior Boys' album "Exit" yet you're really
missing out.

Unforunately Kin's founder, Nick Kilroy, passed away yesterday. He left
us with these wonderful photos:

That was me working with the rebel notion that you can mix records from 
any bin with records from any bin, with no common theme but love.  ghetto 
tech + funk + house + techno + electro + breaks + selections from the 
soundtrack of flashdance cause that is how we do.

and like, the awesome fact that when the guest dj flakes, I get their 
drink tickets.  i am the 80 proof pacman.  love it!  power pill, lights 
out, ghosts who haunted me now die as I eat you.

on the booking stuff shawn... welcome to the fucking planet.  if you play 
techno, your weenie shrivels up from atrophy.  hahahha.  tricked you!  
you can play a million other things, doesn't matter.  you turn into 
bastard techno person.  pr is a bitch mon.  haha!  at least you have your 
integrity and a ton of records that all make mechanical noises that arouse 
significant emotional response in 100% of people in a random sampling of 
um.. YOU!

dooooooot!

techno forever.

DJ Shawn.. not 2 knowck your status as what I called U B4... but ya

=)

It's funny, the furthest thing I have from my mind right now is throwin'
my own event or like rave or something, but apparently I'm already booking
3 DJs 4 my Rave!!!  LOLOLOLOLMAO.. Hello 2Day..

I dunno.. maybe promoters are just scared of takin' chances now???  It
kinda sucks.. yeah... letting DJs spin who are in that social circle
already is pretty much how it is done i guess, huh?!  I mean.. hmmm... I
dunno... just thought I'd add on 2 this thread...

Love U all!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Mariano on An Epiphany of Sound today

On a quest to help bring about a revival of the PsyTrance scene in San
Francisco, ex KZSU-er DJ Mariano will make a return appearance on An

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a brief rant

the recent techno/gig thing reminded me of some discussions going on 
elsewhere on the internet.  and mind you, i'm no techno expert, but i'll say 
this.

there's been talk in the DnB and breaks community recently about how to 
expand the scene and introduce more people to the genres.  the points:

1)  get young people involved
2)  work with other crews and communities

getting young people involved is essential.  and by young i mean both young 
in age and young in experience with dance music.  if you want to keep 
playing for the same people that have been listening to techno for 5, 6, 7 
or 10+ years, that's fine. but it's rare that it will inject new energy and 
enthusiasm into that scene.  sure, they love the music and they appreciate 
it...but it's the same community of people.  over and over.  getting new 
people involved can help techno appreciation and love grow in size and 
passion.  as people in the scene move on, you will have a steady influx of 
new pace

working with other crews does the same thing.  but it also lets you see how 
other crews and communities are growing themselves.  we all love music.  
let's get together and help each other

i know it's more comfortable and easier to stay among the folks that you 
know, but i think it's worth the risk to reach out to more people.  lots of 
Evil Breaks DJs play at candy parties that would make some on this list 
nauceous.  we frequent message boards that cater to younger rave audiences 
(yes, I'm talking about Bay Raves).  but we are pushing breaks and getting 
it to the ears of a younger crowd that will eventually (hopefully) move on 
to other scenes, clubs and undergrounds as they grow older.  they are going 
to be the ones at the next FnF new years.  they are going to be at the next 
Moksha Tribe party.  they'll be going to Mighty, DNA Lounge and 550 
Barnaveld once they turn 21.  and they will know and appreciate breaks 
(unless they hate Evil Breaks and we've made them loathe us).

i started throwing parties with Aaron Jae when i was unemployed.  we both 
put our rent money on the line.  we spent every weekend going out to parties 
and meeting people and talking with folks.  it was a tough time and we 
couldn't have made it through without the support of our friends and the 
people that came out to our parties (dancers, djs, volunteers, etc).  but 
it's been great and breaks are out there.  we had ALL breaks in the MAIN 
room of Furious 2, a 600+ person, all ages party.  i haven't seen that in 
the bay area in years.

and with that, i also invite all of you out to Dirty on the 19th of this 
month.  we have breaks AND techno.  fancy that!

and the Evil Breaks one year anniversary party is March 19th.  i'd be 
honored to have you all help us celebrate.

Well, that newly-announced slot at OW Valentines ought to keep you at
least a little happy :)  

As a fellow bay area EDM person I gotta vouch for Shawn- encyclopedic
record collection (you've got to check out his organization method
sometime), beautiful mixes, wonderful dancefloor vibe, great attitude
(unless you're a right-wingnut and you happen to drop some dubious
statistic around him ;), man's got it down.

We booked him for one of the first .folded.s and he rocked it big time.
 Right now we are trying to burn through everybody we want to book
before bringing back any alumnis but when we do decide to go back
around he's first on my list :)

Anyway, just a glowing endorsement for any promoters reading this
thread.  

Btw, shawn, I think you should take a clue from my brilliant (non) dj
career and start playing melodica as you spin (and run it through a
kaoss pad).  Rocksteady ska wind instrument PRESSHA!

Subject: [sfraves] SpaceHookers - Feb12th @ BlueCube


Gus (aka AudioEl and also of Protolab + Cybrid fame) and I have formed a 
band called SpaceHookers that does a weird take on electroclash, mashup 
madness, techno, and having a good time rocking out on mics + notebooks + 
assorted garage sale instruments.  Our last gig in December caned it, I 
think we finally got the right blend of energy, high proof liquor and 
planning and I'm ready to tell people about it.  :)

We're playing this weekend, Saturday night, right after Broker Dealer 
(probably 1am-ish?) at this fine event called 'Love is a Battlefield'.

First off, my comments were in no way intended to "denigrate the
service" of the Hugger-Mugger faithful. ;) I also must add that J.C. has
been very supportive of my bizarre tastes, and I've had an absolute
blast playing on An Epiphany of Sound lately. J.C. == techno respect.

Subject: [sfraves] looking for a few good DJs


so a friend of mine is looking for some music (chill, psytrance, more 
ethnic tribal stuff) to flesh out
his Internet radio station (www.earthrites.org/radio.htm).  If you have 
recommendations, or mixes you'd like
put on the air, etc, e-mail info@earthrites.org and a short bio if you'd 
like it put on the site.  payment?
I have no idea.  But the free music industry is like the open source 
movement - gift economies are more
about making contacts, getting your work out there, and profit becomes a 
consequence (an effect) rather
than the motivation (a cause)   I see some philosophical essay coming re: 
how capitalism has to change.....
But I'm not a DJ - do you all see things this way?  thoughts?

thanks,
doug

Subject: RE: [sfraves] a brief rant

At the risk of sounding like a suck up - which, fuck y'all if ya think 
that...I think Shawn is one of the BEST local dj's I have yet to hear. And I 
agree - I have been out and heard some people "spin" that didn't even seem 
to be able to grasp the basics of beatmatching. I won't name names here, 
because that'd just be rude - but there're definitely some dj's out there 
that must kiss a whole lot of ass.

Of course - I'm a fairweather DJ (IMHO anyway). Somedays I'm on - some, I 
just upset myself. Irrational nervousness seems to be a great cause of me 
being off when I'm off, and it's totally frustrating. Eh - what can ya do?

ANyway - bottom line - Shawn Allen = GREAT DJ. Book him people.

Marco

Goddammit Andy, I'M NOT LIKE YOU! *My* techno induces hour-long
erections... or something. Seriously though, what's up with the techno
stigma? Did I just automatically become an asshole in everyone's eyes
when I started buying Spectral records?

That's exactly my problem. I come home every night to find a 2000+
collection staring me in the face:

<http://alterior.net/tmp/records1.jpg>
<http://alterior.net/tmp/records2.jpg> (I'm still unpacking)

"PLAY ME," they scream. "TAKE ME TO A DARK SWEATY WAREHOUSE AND LET ME
SIIIIIIING!" I had them boxed up for nearly a month, and now that I've
finally got my turntables set up again they're psyched. But for both of
us, a lone pink neon flamingo light is not a suitable audience. I'm back
in San Francisco, I'm single for the first time in nearly 5 years, and
I've still got that "fuck 2004, 2005 is the year to rock out" thing that
I picked up on NYE going. Am I desperate? Not yet. Am I shameless? Fuck
yeah, and it's about time. I've been humble far too long. BOOK MY ASS!

Toodles,

maybe you should spin downtempo - this past year i've had more
bookings than ever.  and i don't kiss ass.  (tip to tip: well
that's a different matter... ;)

regarding techno, i'm spinning at the surgeon party next
friday.  this is my *first* techno booking since i handed out
my techno CD early last year.  from what i've seen, you've had
a ton of techno gigs:  i guess it's all a matter of
perspective.

i had a discussion with some dood on forest green's online
journal regarding your statement:  

> But for both of us, a lone pink neon flamingo light

i feel you on this.  sometimes i just play to the bartender.  i
consider it "practice".  ;)

*raises hand*

Matt and I (cubik & origami) could rock a chillroom live PA, Andrew and
I could do a sick decks-and-bass funky fucking house mainroom slot, or
Delaney and I (dj2) could own the late-night tech-house blastoff slot.

..and I love throwing parties.  ..and we've like never hung out,
something I've felt like rectifying for a while.

Whuteva sounds fun, m'man,

Well, with all the music geeks that we have here at the station, we just
went through a 30-40 post thread on record collection organization
methods.  Some CRAZY ideas out there.  (Can forward some of the articles
to interested people.)

I'd definitely be interested in hearing how you're handling that insane
collection at KZSU! My method is pretty simple: on the big shelf,
everything's by label. I think visually, so I tend to be pretty good at
remembering which label a particular track was released on. I do have a
bunch of "orphan" records that are on labels from which I don't own any
other releases, and those are the ones I'm still trying to sort out. I'm
probably going to do those by style (roughly), then alphabetically by
artist.

Back in September I visited the Kompakt storefront in Cologne, Germany.
The place was amazing to begin with, but what made it so much cooler was
the organization. Each wall contained its own sufficiently vague style:
abstract/IDM/experimental in one corner; electroclash and pop bootlegs
on the adjacent wall; an entire side of the store (at least 60ft long)
for "minimal techno" (everything from Bpitch Control to Trapez); yet
another wall for electro and "straight" techno; in the opposite corner,
an assortment of crazy hard stuff. Most records were sorted by label,
but a few artists garnered their own hampers.

Anyone else with a lot of records have some tips? Does anyone label
their sleeves with style dots or BPMs anymore? And does anyone know a
place to buy more of those plastic sorting labels?

Cheers,

Some of my best friends are techno DJs, and even more of my friends are
djs who spin techno and other stuff but would love to be booked more
frequently for techno gigs.  Breaks my heart to see them
underappreciated- techno is one of those genres that really lets a good
dj's technique and heart shine, and a good techno set hitting me at the
right time forces dancing like nothing else.

At this point I see two major problems in the local techno scene.  

1. It is too fragmented/cliquey.  Case in point: DEF:SF, a crew that
has long dedicated itself to throwing quality techno events and uniting
the local scene, threw Is:As, a party with a good lineup, high
production values (or as high as the smaller venue would permit), and,
for the most part, a large underrepresentation in attendance by the
techno community.  

Sure, good-natured stalwarts like Andy and Shawn were there and some
great djs including Forest Green spun, but there were a lot of heads I
expected to see that weren't there.  Same story with a lot of other
really good techno events that should be drawing more folks.  I'm
hoping that the excitement about this weekend's Alien Autopsy party
will bring some of the factions together.

2. It has cool-ed itself out of the popular cool zone.  Some techno
heads are so zealous and monochromatic about their chosen genre that
they put off a "fuck you, I'm more techno than you" aura.  This
attitude does not work to bring new faces and creative input into a
scene.  There is a fine line between generating mystique/exclusivity
and putting a barrier at the gates of a scene through which only those
cool enough may pass.

In any case, I am a techno lover but I myself don't go out to all of
the available parties, mainly because I don't always feel a sense of
family when I do, the way I do at less genre-specific ugs and even some
club nights.  Recent parties at the OW and the DEF party are notable
exceptions in the family department.

I'm not a true techno stalwart so I may be talking out of my
proverbial, but this is how I see it.  I know that I personally felt
outcooled by hardcore techno people until I got to know them.  Once I
did I realized they were silly teddybear bastards like the rest of us.

hehe

I'm back in Atlanta again. Think this is my 4th time here or so now
but this time around I'm a tad bored. I went to a club here and let me
just say - smashing bad hip hop tracks into each other off neumark cd
decks just hurts. All the girls that work there are dressed in beach
volleyball bathing suit things. Eyecandy, but dumb. Teh dum. 
Anyway...

Anyone have leads on the party kids out here? Are there such people
out here? Please tell me there is... I really don't want to be
visiting more places like that for my entertainment. Help me out
people. Show me where the love is at!

Subject: [sfraves] Silver's North American Tour

-------------------------------1107987171
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

We are currently accepting last minute requests for Silver's North American 
tour!!!!!!
This tour has a few dates left in February and March. All dates will include 
a flight share. Please inquire about availability ASAP (weekend and weekdates 
still available). 

The genre of drum & bass has always been about expanding boundaries and 
filling open gaps to create new, innovative sounds for the dance floor. Sonic & 
Silver, the Accidental Heroes, formed in 1999 for this precise reason: to push 
their funky, dubbed-out, atmospheric sound to a widespread audience across the 
world. With accumulating credits to many major labels including Metalheadz, 
Timeless, Virus, Soul:R, Reinforced, Renegade Hardware, Sonic's Space label and 
the duo's own Science Fiction Recordings, there seems to be no pause for these 
two talented artists.  
In addition to their mighty discography, the Accidental Heroes have worked 
their way into numerous notable publications, including Mixmag, Knowledge, NME, 
and ATM. The Heroes have had an impressive run touring the world over the last 
three years and are now returning home to England to focus on various solo 
projects.  

Silver has been working with BBC's 1xtra as of late, with projects on V 
Recordings, Emotif, Timeless, L Plates, and his newest release on Random 
Recordings, "The Jamaican Indian EP." Don't be surprised if you find him running around 
San Francisco, where he has been working with Gridlok and Hive on a few things 
as well.  

Please inquire about DJ Gamet available for select dates on this tour as well.

Please contact Charity Gallagher of Sublunary Artist Management for bookings.

Cabbage Town is where it's at. I think there's a Satellite records
franchise somewhere around there, they might know what's going on. Sorry
to be so vague, I've only been down there a couple of times and it was
for family stuff. Hope you're having fun!

Count me in as well.  Sorry to say I am a lurker on the list and have
been too busy to post.  Yeah, I know.  Lame excuse <bows head>

Anyhow, who is in charge of this fiasco, I mean party?  I am multi
talented, am a dj, and can carry speakers, field questions, scout, you
name it.  I was involved with the scene in Southern California and
want to do it all over again here.

Met a distributor @ the liquor store this afternoon while buying some cigs. Gave me a free poster (with Nelli sp?) flossin his pimp juice & a couple samples.
 
Has a radioactive-green hue to it & is really rich- no tang. Think I'll stick to the 'Bull on a bad morning. 
 
peace

Yeah... I was strikingly optimistic NYE as well.

As of now I'm getting booked more to do spatial sound than perform. For 
those that attended Furious 2 my handiwork was behind the spatial setup of 
the system in the main room.

The next event I'll be doing spatial sound at is For The Love of Bass 2 on 
March 12... You guys should go and check it out then book me for spatial 
sound as it kicks ass... of course I'm down to throw down beats as well..

I suppose putting out the link for my techno sets is appropriate once 
again: http://www.egregious.net/media/   If you need 1, 3, 5, 7 or more 
techno mixes (more than half live mixes) well that is one place to check.. 
:)  minimal to hard...

I dunno.. My set at the last Basswaves was probably the most people I've 
ever had "into it" for a straight up techno set in the SF area. The Minimal 
Monday one was pretty rad too; especially since you can hear people 
cheering in the recording (picked up via the needle); probably on the rare 
side for MM. ;P If there was one set for people to check out on this list 
it is the MM one as it is the most "approachable".

My big push this year locally is to organize live EDM events at the new 
Asphodel facility on a 16.8 system running my super sleak _3D_ 
spatialization software.  For my own live performance tools I've got 
this  idea of spatial granular synthesis and being able to do volumetric 
textures and then the matrix math!!! I mean like layers of rotating 
textures..  This and a whole lot more for the most part unheard 
techniques/sounds. Should be good stuff around the end of the year... hint 
hint...

I'm also making a commitment to get a second record out there before 
summer.. Hmm.. If you spin techno or just want to support then check out 
the 1st one and order it... Sadly, it didn't get picked up for distro and 
I'm sitting on over 350 copies.  http://egr.egregious.net/

If not getting booked is discouraging... well not getting your record 
distributed is more so Shawn.. For #2 though I'm going to get a remix by a 
"larger name", unfortunately that seems to be necessary especially if you 
are trying to establish a techno label from the SF area..

Best,
--Mike

awesome, delia.  suggestions for ways to meet up:

1)  virtually via email list or IM chat
2)  meet up somewhere free like...Hugger Mugger next Tuesday!
3)  meet up at Dirty!  no wait, we'll all be too drunk and freaking on the 
dancefloor
4)  my place in the city.  i live in SOMA.  lots of space.  maybe sunday 
night?
5)  some other neutral place that is easy to get to.  suggestions?

But what a shitty interface (but it's OH SO PRETTY!)  They're selling
shit, but there's no way for someone to easily let a friend in on how to
get something specific from them (can't link directly to an item,
had to do what you did.)  One more level and you hit
http://turntablelab.com/accessories/accessories1.html which is the page
where the item is at.

Guess they don't really want sales.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SpaceHookers - Feb12th @ BlueCube

get to know the Spacehookers:

Spacehookers (Electropussywhipped - Prague / Bucharest / London /
Tokyo / New York)
Andrei and Gustav are one of Eastern Europe's top electronic duos. Known 
equally for their jacked-up and dubbed out beats and Ian Curtis-meets-Lou 
Reed vocals as for their on-stage (and off-stage) decadent debauchery, this 
show is their first American performance. Much closer to Prince than to 
Kraftwerk, Spacehookers are usually seen dancing wildly, simulating sex acts 
with audience members, and arranging rendezvous with groupies during their 
performances. Not to be missed.

awesome, delia. suggestions for ways to meet up:

1) virtually via email list or IM chat
2) meet up somewhere free like...Hugger Mugger next Tuesday!
3) meet up at Dirty! no wait, we'll all be too drunk and freaking on the 
dancefloor
4) my place in the city. i live in SOMA. lots of space. maybe sunday 
night?
5) some other neutral place that is easy to get to. suggestions?

Continuation, detailing the synthesis of and their personal experience with 
hundreds of psychedelics.

The Shulgins will be online to address your questions on a range of topics 
from the "war on drugs" to the therapeutic use of MDMA. Please email

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] party.throwing.people+resources

First off - cool. I hope you guys follow through and have a party.
Take some video for me since I'll be in some other country.

Party throwing is easy.

Venue
Sound
Talent

That with a lot of common sense is all you really need. Sort those 3
things, and hopefully all posess common sense, and you're good for
moving onto the other fun stuff. Now when it comes to the other fun
stuff like prop parties for banners and such don't forget to ask
around. It's rather amazing the resources you can have access to if
you do this party to meet budjet. There are people on this list with
gear and supplies that can save you a lot of time and effort.

Just keep things simple and don't blow the planning up into more than
it has to be. Personally a few of us have been bored out of our minds
and because of that ended up with a party planned and executed in a
day. Always remember that it's a party. This is fun times with good
friends. =)

Use SFRaves to your advantage if you need something...

awesome, delia. suggestions for ways to meet up:

1) virtually via email list or IM chat
2) meet up somewhere free like...Hugger Mugger next Tuesday!
3) meet up at Dirty! no wait, we'll all be too drunk and freaking on the 
dancefloor
4) my place in the city. i live in SOMA. lots of space. maybe sunday 
night?
5) some other neutral place that is easy to get to. suggestions?

equiptment

still is pretty easy, but it seems as though you are talking to us like we

Even better idea - 3 way tag set between PXD, Bam & me...(need a coupole 
hours tho for that). And we're all able-bodied young men who can lift shit 
and whatnot, so we can not only perform, but assist in setting up stuff, 
etc.

it's a 2 for 3 for 1 special!

Of course both of them might think that's just a rotten idea. lol

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: What was your most memorable party between 1992-present where you connected with other SFRavers?

Well, mine would have to be Whoopie Ball 1992.  I
lived in Sacramento at the time.  My best mate was
really getting into the rave scene...I didn't know
what to make of it yet.  She'd play her mix tapes
every morning and I really couldn't get into any of
it.  "James Brown is Dead", or "Charly". I have to
admit, I just thought it annoying music. Anyways, she
invited me to go to a "rave" in Oakland with a couple
of our friends.  I thought what the heck since I had a
mad crush on one of the guys we'd be going with. 

So, we all piled in a car and drove to the bay area
listening to the Orbital.  We stopped off at the Shell
in Emerville for blow pops, water, etc.  Called the
info line on the flier for directions and drove to
some undisclosed location off of Hegenberger Rd..  We
parked and proceeded to the place with the thumping
beat.  Well, I had know idea what this "e"xperience
would be like but I just knew I found it thrilling. 
The pumping beats, the friendly people, crazy outfits,
and 3 warehouses of just pure fun. I was hooked on it
& the music. The chill space was relaxing and there
were these computers set up on opposite sides of the
warehouse where you could message back and forth to
unkown strangers passing by.  Wow did I think that was
so cool!  Little did I know where raving would end
up...still going strong today and that the internet
would bust open a whole new world of communicating.  

After joining SFRaves back when it was formed I found
it such a joy to able to communicate with other
ravers.  I remember how excited I was when I got my
SFRaves laminate.  It was like our little club and it
made it nice to be able to keep in touch after
attending parties. Congratulations SFRaves on
continuing to thrive for our awesome community!

Rave On,

- Siren

Why don't we make the party double themed - since we're all on SFR 
anyway...have a nice cross section of new folks like me and older veterans, 
but keep it a family vibe.

Death of a Playwright

by Joal Ryan
Feb 11, 2005, 10:00 AM PT

Playwrights don't marry 
<http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/Bio/0,128,11013,00.html>Marilyn 
Monroe. <http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/0,12,10822,00.html>Arthur 
Miller was the exception.

The celebrated writer of Death of a Salesman, Miller died Thursday night at 
his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, of congestive heart failure. He was 89.

Even before Monroe formally entered the picture in 1956 as his second wife, 
Miller was famous for his words--and serious ones, at that.

Death of a Salesman, the 1949 play that brought Miller the Tony Award, the 
New York Drama Critics Circle Award, the Pulitzer Prize and celebrity, was 
the heartbreaking tale of Willie Loman, a man who wore out more than shoe 
leather looking for the American dream.

The Crucible, the 1953 Tony winner for Best Play, echoed the era's 
Communist witch hunts in Congress with the story of the 17th century witch 
hunts in Salem, Massachusetts.

<http://www.eonline.com/Facts/Movies/0,60,13420,00.html>Playing for Time, 
the 1980 TV-movie that earned Miller an Emmy for Outstanding Writing, was 
the portrait of a real-life Nazi concentration camp internee, played by 
<http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/Bio/0,128,13050,00.html>Vanessa 
Redgrave, who used her violin to stave off execution.

In part, Miller's writing won him four Tonys, two Emmys, one Oscar 
nomination (for the 1996 film version of 
<http://www.eonline.com/Facts/Movies/0,60,125,00.html>The Crucible), the 
Pulitzer, and a host of lifetime achievement honors, including those 
bestowed upon him by the Kennedy Center in 1984 and the Tonys in 1999.

As an aside, the writing earned him entree to Hollywood, and access to 
Hollywood's quintessential creation, Marilyn Monroe.

"She was a whirling light to me then, all paradox and enticing mystery," 
Miller wrote of Monroe in his 1987 autobiography, Timebends, "street-tough 
one moment, then lifted by a lyrical and poetic sensitivity that few retain 
past adolescence."

Miller and Monroe became involved as his first marriage to Mary Grace 
Slattery was cooling, and Miller was facing heat for refusing to name names 
of suspected Communists before the House Un-American Activities Committee.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Well if it's "just" a house party, you just throw it :).

FnF has gotten too fucking organized, if you ask me. People are
intimidated from taking on roles.

place is pretty damn big (it's a warehouse) but out of respect for my 
housemates, i'd like to keep this meeting at less than 12 people.

i'm going to suggest this sunday at 3pm.  keep the meeting at 2 hours or 
under.  basically, just so people can meet and discuss things.  after that, 
we can set up a mailing list for a core group of organizers and volunteers.  
from there we can organize future meetings.

does this work for people?  if not, do people have other suggestions?

if sunday is a go, i live in SOMA on 5th street near Folsom.  i'll email my 
address and phone number to those that have responded to this "let's throw a 
party thread".

thats so true if you make it bigger than it is it gets
totally blown out of proportion. those are things to
consider but they should be considered obstacles in
the way.

It can be easy or hard people.  It's all about what you want to put into it.

Doesn't take a million dollars or a thousand people to throw a party.

Subject: [sfraves] free storage cabinet for records

i have this metal media storage cabinet that's perfect for
holding records.  it has double doors that latch and
everything.

2'5" wide, 1'2" deep, 5' high.  "putty" color.  inside is a bit
banged around on the sides, but it's held my records faithfully
for 15 years.  time to move the fuck on!

yours for free - you'll need a truck and some strong arms and
legs:  the thing is pretty heavy.  i have a handtruck, and will
help you load up at my place in oakland.  i'll post to
craigslist in a couple of days.

shoot me a private email...

Well, the same ingredients would still be a good time...

You throw Oakie down the missile silo, then invite your friends to munch a 
barrel of E and sing "ding dong the bitch is dead".

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party.throwing.people+resources

I think what you said is true- that holy trinity is all that is
required for a good party, the rest are pretty optional (depending on
your aims for production values/party size).  I've had some wonderful
experiences at impromptu get-togethers where it was clear none of the
things below were thought about, but the venue was good enough, the
sound good enough, and the talent good enough to smooth over the rough
edges.  Hell, I've had good times when one or two of those were
missing, even.

All the niceties are great, but when I'm in the moment enjoying myself,
I am thinking chiefly about the music, my mindset, and being with
friends.  I could care less if there's a fuzzy green catarpillar firing
laser bolts onto the dancefloor. ;)  

That's not to say I don't appreciate a party where it's clear people
have worked to make it a beautiful space and a safe place to TAZ out.

To each, their own, and to all, a good rave.

Hope I'm not too late to volunteer for this party thing....  I think I
might be the only person on this list who only checks their email once a
day. I'm a little behind.   ;)

The DEF krew would be happy to help out with this adventure, it sounds
fun.  We've got lots of rave gear that could be of use.  I'll bring the
zip ties and fluorescent pink twine!

Speaking of laminate......... I have not gotten a new one IN YEARS! What's

am long overdue! Please help the needy!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: What was your most memorable
party between 1992-present where you connected with other SFRavers?

Well, mine would have to be Whoopie Ball 1992.  I
lived in Sacramento at the time.  My best mate was
really getting into the rave scene...I didn't know
what to make of it yet.  She'd play her mix tapes
every morning and I really couldn't get into any of
it.  "James Brown is Dead", or "Charly". I have to
admit, I just thought it annoying music. Anyways, she
invited me to go to a "rave" in Oakland with a couple
of our friends.  I thought what the heck since I had a
mad crush on one of the guys we'd be going with. 

So, we all piled in a car and drove to the bay area
listening to the Orbital.  We stopped off at the Shell
in Emerville for blow pops, water, etc.  Called the
info line on the flier for directions and drove to
some undisclosed location off of Hegenberger Rd..  We
parked and proceeded to the place with the thumping
beat.  Well, I had know idea what this "e"xperience
would be like but I just knew I found it thrilling. 
The pumping beats, the friendly people, crazy outfits,
and 3 warehouses of just pure fun. I was hooked on it
& the music. The chill space was relaxing and there
were these computers set up on opposite sides of the
warehouse where you could message back and forth to
unkown strangers passing by.  Wow did I think that was
so cool!  Little did I know where raving would end
up...still going strong today and that the internet
would bust open a whole new world of communicating.  

After joining SFRaves back when it was formed I found
it such a joy to able to communicate with other
ravers.  I remember how excited I was when I got my
SFRaves laminate.  It was like our little club and it
made it nice to be able to keep in touch after
attending parties. Congratulations SFRaves on
continuing to thrive for our awesome community!

Rave On,

- Siren

Hrm... That actually sounds kinda kool! Why has it taken 13 years to start
thinking about this kinda thing :-( Guess you have to be a teenager to have
a semi-operable mind :-) Wonder what sfr will be like when it hits 18, then
21, then menopause, then retirement.......Will there be social security
available or will sfr become homeless or a Wal-Mart greeter? Oh the terrible
bad thoughts.......

Oh has anyone sat down with sfr an talked about the birds and the bees? I
mean sfr is 13 now! That is the age where....... I think someone needs to
have this talk. We don't need a pregnant sfr @ age 13!

What are you talking about? FNF NYE was awesome! I thought it was great on
the internals, the nice CGI Page where you picked your shift etc.  I mean
yes with age comes wisdom, so you certainly know what works and does not
work. When in history was an FNF event ever broken up? None that I know of,
as they are always fully prepared :-) FNF has some of the most intelligent
folks in the universe and beyond.

FnF has gotten too fucking organized, if you ask me. People are

Winston "DJ Wisdom" Bailey, Justin "DJ J-Boogie" Boland, and Rob "DJ Raw=20
B" Blach -- joined forces to produce an all-live underground hip-hop mix=20

cutting up a Van Halen song on the air, we try to show that hip-hop is not=
=20
just some tiny box. The doors are wide open, and that's the way we do it."

but with a better liquor cabinet.. ), where the music is never, ever=20
awful~E The Revive Project consists of Derek Niddery, John Dupre, and Matt=
=20
Valenz.

You can come INSIDE for our next party on February 17th with the amazing=20
and seriously grooving CHRIS LUM, along with Derek and Matt on backup=20
musical duty.

INSIDE exists at the LEVENDE LOUNGE, winner of CITYSEARCH~RS ~Q Best Of ~Q=
=20
award in 10 categories.  Levende Lounge is at 1710 Mission Street at=20
Duboce in San Francisco.

DJ BIO:  Chris Lum The grossly underrated Chris Lum traded the land of=20
smog (L.A.) for the land of fog (San Francisco), where he is now a=20
prominent member of the underground house community. He runs his own=20
commercial sound studio, Abitare Music, and assists in the running of=20
Moulton Studios with his partner in crime Jay J Hernandez. Lum and=20
Hernandez (aka Jay J) co-produce as 2 Utes on a number of respected=20
underground imprints. His own label, Crisp Records, has been an outlet for=
=20
DJ Rasoul (Transport, Naked Music, and Large) and many others.  Lum has=20
produced possibly his best work to date for Tilted, the label managed by=20
Nervous and Freeze recording artist Brent Laurence. With its=20
straightforward kicks, inspired chord changes, and funky disco samples,=20
"Stay With Me" is pure sex on wax. Think Seasons, Dufflebag, and Ovum=20
multiplied by ten. Everyone should own a copy of this record.

DJ BIO: Matt Valenz In a world overtaken by automation and technology,=20
soul can be a hard thing to come by.  For someone lucky enough to be=20
raised on the sounds of Earth Wind & Fire, Kool and the Gang, Diana Ross,=
=20
and Tower of Power, being soulful comes as second nature. At 17 he was=20
turned onto vinyl and was soon playing Miami bass, freestyle, and=20
primitive house at small underground parties in the central California=20
area, then moved on to start a career in the music business when he=20
relocated to San Francisco at age 21.  He continued his drive to learn=20
every aspect of the industry, and returned a few years ago from a two year=
=20
stay in England where he was the booking manager for dy-na-mix agency, the=
=20
best agency for underground music in Europe. Now, back in that city, he is=
=20
resident at ~Q Loveworks Dancing ~Q, a mobile house music phenomenon=20
focusing on vibe, music, and art.  past guests such as Doc Martin, Joi=20
Cardwell, J. Sinister, DJ Diz, and international guests like the UK's=20
Eddie Richards, A Man Called Adam, and Terry Francis have also helped to=20
establish the party as a premier place for true house music, funk, soul,=20
and classics in the bay area.  He continues to play at the some of San=20
Francisco's best parties and is currently assembling a personal studio.

DJ BIO:  Derek Niddery Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, music has=20
always played a pivotal role in his life.  Being exposed to his parent~Rs=
=20
extensive record collection from the 50~Rs, 60~Rs and 70~Rs, he learned to=
=20
appreciate the different styles and sounds of jazz, funk, soul, rock, and=
=20
reggae.  Learning to play the guitar, drums, and congas that were always=20
present in the house, he would often watch his father record his own=20
weekend jam sessions on to old eight tracks.  Having the opportunity to=20
play drums in a band back in the early 90~Rs, he continues to push his=20
percussion skills today and will often play the congas throughout San=20
Francisco.  One of his biggest thrills came when he had the opportunity to=
=20
sit in and play congas with a Cuban jazz band while visiting Havana, Cuba=
=20
in September of 2003.  Now, only two years on the decks, he has already=20
worked with some of the Bay Area~Rs top promoters and DJ~Rs.  He believes=
=20
House music encompasses all styles of music and allows for unlimited=20
creativity.  This philosophy holds true in the music he chooses, always=20
bringing an uplifting passionate energy to his sets.

American Nun Shot to Death in Brazil's Amazon


U.S. National - Reuters

BELEM, Brazil (Reuters) - A 74-year-old American nun was shot to death =
early
on Saturday in Brazil's Amazon rain forest (news - web sites) where she
worked to defend human rights and the environment despite frequent death
threats, federal police said.=20


=A0
Unknown assailants shot U.S. missionary, Dorothy Stang at point-blank =
range
at an isolated agricultural settlement in dense jungle 31 miles from the
town of Anapu in the state of Para, police and fellow religious workers
said.=20
"It was three shots at point-blank range," said sister Betsy Flynn of
Stang's order the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. "She received so many
threats, I never thought it would happen."=20
Stang had worked in the area around a decade defending the rights of
landless peasants and small farmers and promoting sustainable use of the
rain forest, according to the Brazilian Order of Lawyers (OAB), a =
national
lawyers' association.=20
She recently won a human rights award from the OAB for reporting abuses =
by
land speculators, illegal loggers and large landowners in the area.=20
Only weeks ago she warned federal human rights authorities she faced
continual death threats for her work. She was on an OAB list of people =
who
faced possible assassination.=20
"This death is just more encouragement to continue her work to confront =
the
people who are destroying the forest," said Meire Cohen of the OAB.=20
Brazilian media earlier reported Stang's age as 73.=20

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Blaze is da shiz/ Do You Remember House?

Very familiar with this record. Excellent double pack. Lots of well crafted 
songs pulling elements from jazz, 70's r & b, and disco. Reminiscent of 
early Earth Wind and Fire. Check out the instrumental "Gloria Muse", the 
extended piano solo is absolutely beautiful. This baby stays in my record 
bag at all times!

I just bought the Pioneer AVIC-N1 Navigation/DVD/MP3/ with XM Traffic
service (Cuz matt needs his toys and I get lost, so now this will fix that
problem plus it navigates you away from construction and traffic)

 

So I decided I will add the satellite service radio. But my dilemma.. XM or
Sirius?  Anyone used both? Which do you prefer? Help old matt make a wise
decision :-)

 

 

I am more leaning towards XM since I will already have a subscription to the
traffic service.

 

Thanks,

matt

It only takes 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative

who stands still moves backwards.

Subject: [sfraves] FnF Breakups

Just to point out FnF HAVE been broken up before.... It is not very often 
but on more then one occasion they have gotten busted. Even the coveted 
best, brightest and most prepared promoters get shut down from time to time.

I worked and attended that party, and really, it's near the bottom as 
FnF's go in my book.  Better than most parties in general, yes... but 6 
rooms is bullshit that is best left to massive promoters.  I also happen 
to think it was too broadly promoted and at times annoying crowded.  And 
if I recall correctly, they were *selling* bottled water upstairs which I 
can't remember ever seeing at an FNF.

In any case, still the place to be but not my favorite party or favorite 
fnf ever by a long shot.  On the bright side, it was the first time I go 
to play guitar at a rave sorta thing which was fun and I saw tons of 
people I just love to death.

That would be awesome :)
We are moving out there in a little over a month and it would be a cool way to meet people on here, I met a good chunk of my friends on DC's Hyperreal list.
 
Hi, I'm Kellie by the way. I would love to offer my assistance, but I wont untill I see how intense my school out in SF is going to be. But, I love throwing events/partys, it is a great way to hang out w\ people and get to know them. I'm looking forward to seeing the differnece in the scene out west, Marco has nothing but great things to say about it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party idea...

Yeah I've been trying not to get cynical on ya'll on this, but you're going
to have a bitch of a time getting together a lineup for this party, mainly
because about 75% of SFR is a DJ and everyone will want to play if they
contribute which won't happen and a number of people will be bitter about
it.  About 20 people have nominated themselves already.  That, and you'll be
doing the same thing about every crew in the Bay does which is book their
own crew/friends/girlfriends/boyfriends that only goes to further the
cliqueness of the underground scene out here.  What I'd personally love to
see is an SFR party that booked all DJs from outside of the list so that we
got talent outside of this circle and brought some fresh blood in with it.
But that's never going to happen so I'll shut up now.

Or you could consider having an SFR poll for who people on the list would
most want to see play and pick a lineup that way...

The monthly sounds cool though if people actually were to support it when
they weren't playing, it'd be nice to get to meet folks on the list in a
more relaxed environment and it'd give everyone a chance to play over time.

Hmm...
Well, I have XM, and it ROX! I'm not sure how many EDM
stations are on Sirrius, but there are 3 on XM. Also,
there are a lot of other awesome indie stations, rock
stations, jazz..ETC! I'm a huge music fan, of all
different kinds, so it is awesome for me and my man.
I highly recomend XM to EVERYONE! It's what i pay for
monthly in place of cable, every huge music fan should
have it ;)

I have no idea why that post took over two days from sending to make it to

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR > XM or Sirius? Which do I choose?

Haven't used Sirrius but love XM myself, then again I'm biased like.  The
Move is dope, lots of good underground house shows.  Also if you're a Thump
fan they have two weekly shows on The Move.  I'll be on one with George
jamming on the bass and with a bunch of our original tracks in March.  I
spend most of the time listening to the oldschool/funk/soul channel though,
some quality jazz channels too.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party.throwing.people+resources

Technically that was an OW resident that setup his own bar. I didn't
realize he was selling water, but then again the party was rather
massive like. I look forward to any events where I'm around all my
friends. Probably one of the biggest reasons I love the Sunset day
parties so much. Friends, music, sun and fun.

Damn I'm going to miss the day parties and campouts with everyone. =(

btw - nice pictures from your Spacehookers gig and adventures beyond!

Dude, do NOT talk about fight club.  That's like the 4th or 5th rule.  
But I don't think I get your joke.

Downer, i was only playing with you.  You know you're my favorite skinny white boy, right?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party idea...

See to me Ascension was the SFR weekly back in it's hay day. Then
Michael was doing his thing at Thristy Bear and a lot of SFR people
were hitting that up.  Even Andrew and George's Folded @ Anu is a
sorta SFR hangout. Granted, that's not a weekly but you all see the
point. The closest thing to what you're all talking about would have
to be Cannabass in Oakland. 8 - 10pm is open decks. There is a
downside to all of this. Having a night where you might here
happycore, good house, bad trance and then jungle all in the same
night makes my ears bleed and baby jesus cry. Really you have to think
about programming otherwise you're going to make people hurt. Anyway.
I've been on this list for almost 6 years and have seen this *let's
throw a party* and *let's have a club night//meet up* thing discussed
over and over with little action. The only time things happened was
when someone took initiative and made them happen. Find that person
and make with less talky and more action. =)

Didn't Valerie Sparks already play, on the official line-up even, at 
Cannabass one night... like back in october or november?

I could swear I remember seeing her name on one of Happy's BSPs, and 
thinking to myself: "THAT's the night I HAVE to go... if only to see 
the contrast when Valerie starts playing in a den of jungleists".

Of course, something or another came up... or maybe I just forgot... or 
maybe I have my BSPs confused... in any event I didn't get to go and 
see the epic clash of the happy vs. the jaded.

junglists do not equal jaded.

junglists = hardcore.  kind of like techno, but techno kids are
harder.

go to surgeon on friday night.  it will kick your ass.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party idea...

She's decided to become one of those girl dj's that dresses nice so
guys will say *ooh girl dj with boobies yay* and thus gets booked
more. To make herself MORE marketable she started playiing house. She
and these other *we think we're sexxxy girls* dj's teamed up to sell
themselves to the fashionable sf market. To me that's just pussy shit.
Nothing special as a dj and playing off looks. And why is it that all
these ex-trancey-core kids are playing house? Did they finally realize
that people grow up and don't listen to that shit? Hahahaha. I have
nothing against female dj's. I do have a problem with the *I play
records and look hot* end of that equation. Sadlly there's too much of
that crap around that gets booked far too much...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR > XM or Sirius? Which do I choose?

XM. I've been listening to Sirrius the past week and I do NOT like
their electronic stations. Boombox - eh - sometimes good. Chill -
about the ONLY thing you can listen to. Good track selections in
there, but a lot of older shit that's mixed into some not so good
stuff. Then you get into Area 65 or something like that and all those
channels - fucking crap ass trance meathead e-tard crap. We're talking
eurotrash dance music or the stuff you see a shitload of floored kids
bouncing too. I have to say that what I hear on friends' XM systems is
FAR superior in quality of music.

XM has Thump. That alone means you're going to have some good music.
If you like the super cheesy fisher-price my first rave trance -
plenty of it waiting for you on Sirrius and not much else in the dance
genre =(

Can't there be both? Or does a girl have to dress down to be taken
seriously? No matter what a person looks like their skills are going
to be more evident when they're on the decks. No amount of cleavage
can cover up bad mixing, and if it does then the DJ is being catered
solely for the type of crowd that doesn't care.

It bothers me that many people assume that if a girl is good looking
that she can't be a very good DJ, as it doesn't work in the reverse.

Does anybody else here think that the NoDoubt version of that song and 
it's derivatives SUCK FLAMING MONKEY ASS compared to the Talk Talk 
original?  Seriously!  Gwen Stefani is a Madonna impersonator hack (with a 
little bit of Cyndi Lauper and Olive Pyl thrown in I guess) of the lowest 
creative caliber... while Mark Hollis (of Talk Talk) has one of the most 
amazing voices I've ever heard (check later albums from Talk Talk like 
"garden of eden" and "laughing stock" for reference... some of the most 
heart shearing ambient/spacejazz totally indescribably beautiful &
emotional music I've ever heard).

Wretch!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party idea...

That's why we have topless girl dj's and other *sexxxy house dj's*
It's really more so about the marketing. Skill wise I have yet to hear
anything impressive. Especially when you look at her specificially and
note that she was a happycore dj and suddenly turned house dj because
that end of the scene is losing people while the house scene is just
getting bigger and bigger. It's business and a good financial move.
But again. I see this more as marketing and business and not so much
about skill and talent. You sounded great at my house party. Matter of
fact you hella surprised me. I totally forgot that you were even
dj'ing. =X  Point being that I don't care what you're wearing if
you're good, but if you market yourself as some upscale glossy female
house dj and aren't doing much on the decks track selection and mixing
wise, well, you're just show and not much go. Sadly most people out in
club land don't know the difference. Really - they don't. Those that
can hear a mix slipping right away are in the minority when we're out.
I'm going to say this is a bad thing.

Yeah.  I have to give them props for covering it at all but I can't
listen to No Doubt at all these days.  The albums just sound like Tony
Kanal is sitting in front of his Pro Tools rig on speed, trying like
mad to fit his band's aging formula into today's pop music sound.

Ok, that is a bit harsh.  That sh*t is like aural sandpaper though.

Nothing like Teh Lag.

Never liked No Doubt at all personally.

What no harsh words for the Jaxx?

this may be old news to some, but caffeine gum has hit the market in a big 
way. mad croc energy gum just may impact your life very soon. the same way that 
red bull has influenced dance culture (DJ Hell wrote my favorite track as an 
ode to it), caffeine gum may make the difference between a 'dopey' or 'speedy' 
night. .. or possibly be the thing that makes raves more sober in the long 
term.

the gum has a faster caffeine come up due to the fact that the gum can be 
used sub lingual-ly (sp?), is alot less harsh on your stomach than 3 rockstars, 
and at 49 cents each are quite possibly more easily addicting than crack.

- now only if nicorette would make that nicotine/caffeine/dental gum i always 
wanted. `;)!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Remixer and Dance Grammy

I like No Doubt, well at least i did when there was the intra band
relationship drama.

this remix of "it's my life" sux monkey ass balls all the way.

it's a little bit worse than "what's going on?" dance remixes by 4 non
blondes.

all you do to me is talk talk

Val spun a fuckin' BAD ASS Jungle set!!  It was Dope!!!  I mean... we
spoke that night when she got there & it was her 1st big "Jungle Gig" that
she ever spun & she was Dope!!!  She's been collecting Jungle vinyl &
spinning

Honestly... she does got skills!!  I'm really proud of the way she tore it
up... I'm sorry Ryan... but no.. she didn't turn 2 the dark side of
spinning where it was a matter of Looks b4 Skills... I mean.. yeah.. she's
part of the "Femme DJs" crew & all that, whatever, but I've always admired
her skills!!!  Well... when she spins out & spins HHC, ofcourse I'm a
happy Camper 'cause lastime I saw she spin HHC @ Telic.. she spun 1 of my
fave songs like ever...  Oooh.. I could like totally go on... Hello 2Day..
but i won't...

Can't compare to the Grammy for "Best" Dance Recording:  "Toxic" by 
Brittany Spears.  My focus was on the Polka Album award to Brave Combo.

I watched the beginning of the Grammy Awards.  After that mess of a jam 
with Black Eyed Peas, Gwen Stefani, Los Lonely Boys and Maroon 5 I dropped 
out until near the end when I tuned in to see Usher and James Brown doing 
"Sex Machine."  Usher CAN dance.

Love,

Apollo

when he/she comes to ask you about why you are still
using IM, just hit um on the head with a brick.  that
should work fine!

If you want to keep them from seeing your traffic you would have to
ssh tunnel out to another server (cloudfactory.org) and pass all of
your traffic over that connection. It's not super hard and it's not
easy. Best thing I can suggest? Get a T-Mobile Sidekick (Danger
HipTop). Then it's your device and they can't regulate or monitor it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party idea...

this shit is really kind of unfair on the lady DJs.

if they're good looking, they get dissed for riding their looks and being hoes.

if they're not good looking, they get dissed for not having looks to ride on.

or, they don't get dissed at all, in which case the mere fact that
they're not getting dissed means the non-disser thinks they're ugly --
which is like some kind of 007 secret dis.

talk about an unwinnable game.

all djs get dissed, even us wannabes, so this is really just kind of
par for the course.

but it's still like whatever.

also, DJing is not about skills. anybody who's fascinated with skills
gets into playing traditional instruments or mastering sound
synthesis. or turntablism, which is not really DJing. DJing is about
the party.

criticizing a DJ for not having skills is like criticizing a
classically trained cellist for not being a party animal.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hiding an IM


So AIM does two things that are kinda obvious from the network... it's 
port (5190-5193) and the IP's it talks to (sucky is that the IP gets 
dynamically assigned from session to session by login.oscar.aol.com but 
AOL in genral is 64.12.0.0 + 205.188.0.0).  Also, like most chat 
protocols, it is MASSIVELY sniffable... you can literally just tap port 
5190 and watch that shit float by like leaves in a stream... a perl one 
liner fixes it up to be as readable as your chat logs.

So you have to use an alternate port _AND_ destination IP block if you 
want to totally hide your nasty bizniz.  Plus, if they do find it, you 
want to try encrypting it.

Just using a client that supports the AOL AIM server's SSH ability is 
enough to throw off most network admins.  You can find AIM clients that 
support SSH, I actually took a liking to an app called NAIM for anything 
that can compile *nix stuff... (works a lot like IRC, all text from a 
terminal, supports color and mssg cueing).  Using this app takes care of 
the protocol/port problem and also is an obscure app they probably won't 
look for... but it's still talking directly to the AOL servers and can be 
detected or blocked... but not read (they'll know what you're doing, but 
not what you're saying).

Ideally, if you have an offsite computer running unix that you can ssh to, 
run naim there (I've compiled it no prob for solaris, osx, linuxes & 
bsd)... then your work only sees an ssh connect to your server (this is 
what I do).  One ssh session, and screen (a terminal window manager that 
allows you to run multiple windows and disconnected/attach without 
skipping a beat) and you're gravy.

Naim info:

Not too easy... but you're hoping to outsmart your network admin, who does 
this shit for a living if they're any good.  :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hiding an IM

I am not sure which IM client you are using, but here Here are a few 
suggestions:

You can tunnel the IMS through SSH, HTTP Proxy (if the client/server 
connection supports SSL), HTTPS (with a lot of know/how config, you can 
encrypt the data using a secure client, or use another messaging 
solution.

http://www.technicalinfo.net/papers/IMSecurity.html eyggestionv


# MSN Messenger . Users must login to the centralised service to locate 
other users. Once a connection is established, users message each other 
directly in peer-to-peer fashion. The default IP port for MSN Messenger is 
1863 but the client is .port-agile. and, if the port is blocked, it will 
look for other open ports . next targeting the HTTP port 80. MSN Messenger 
supports HTTP proxies, but does not support HTTP proxy authentication. 
Note that file transfers occur over TCP port 6891, audio and video 
conferencing over UDP ports 13324 and 13325, and application sharing is 
commonly TCP port 1503.

# Yahoo Instant Messenger . Users login to the centralised Yahoo IM 
service to find other users. Once authenticated and online, users may 
choose to message each other directly or through shared chat rooms. The 
default port for Yahoo Instant Messenger is 5050 but the client is 
.port-agile. and, if the port is blocked, it will look for other open 
ports . next targeting the HTTP port 80. Just like MSN Messenger, the 
client supports HTTP proxies, but not HTTP Proxy authentication. Note that 
file transfers and file sharing is commonly done over TCP port 4443.\

#AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) . Users login in to the AOL Open System for 
Communication in Real-time (OSCAR) and then begin communications with 
Basic OSCAR Services (BOS) to locate and message other users. These 
messages pass through the server before being forwarded to the recipient. 
File transfers, voice traffic and other large digital payloads are 
conducted in peer-to-peer mode . whereby the initiating IM client sends 
its IP address and an open port over the service, so the remote client can 
connect to it.
The default port for the AIM client is 5190 and, if the port is blocked, 
the .port-agile. software will attempt to communicate over port 23 
(telnet), 20 & 21 (FTP) and then 80 (HTTP). In addition, users can choose 
to go through a SOCKS v4/v5, a HTTP proxy or HTTPS proxy. However, when 
tunnelling over the HTTPS proxy connection, AIM does not use SSL to 
encrypt traffic.

Here are other solutions (haven't used them and am not sure of the cost:

http://www.messagingsolutions.com/L7_enterprise.htm

Here are some other solutions depending on your environment 
configuration:

http://216.239.63.104/search?q=cache:ySgYWi4PM-IJ:drn.digitalriver.com/category.php%255Baction%255Dbrowse%26i%3D270%26id%3D163%26f%3D%257C%257C%257C%257C%26s%3Dproduct.date_released%257CDESC%255BSiteID%255Ddriverguide+tunneling+instant+messages&hl=en&start=16

It's a lightweight SOCKS proxy tunneling TCP/UDP traffic through HTTP 
proxy or a firewall. Works with programs like KaZaA, ICQ, Morpheus, WinMX, 
AOL IM, MSN IM, Trillian, FTP, telnet, ssh, and many others. If a client 
program does not support SOCKS protocol Socks2http works in conjunction 
with a "socksifier", like Sockscap32

http://drn.digitalriver.com/product.php%5Bid%5D61790%5Bcid%5D163%5BSiteID%5Ddriverguide?PHPSESSID=bb097d2deac7ac775bc7d507b966b897

Here's more info on proxy tunneling TCP/UDP traffic through HTTP proxy

http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=4&q=http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html&e=7370

I'm not sure about the reliability of this service, but here is another 
option:

Subject: [sfraves] SFRaves Dinner

SFRaves Community Dinner - a place to place a face in the SFRaves 
Community homebase.

Each of these dinners is completely personal, with the intention of 
engaging our community for Non-profit purpose, to meet new friends, the 
joy of getting together offline and in real-life, to build our SFRaves 
community as well as to ensure that we have *HAVE FUN*. We can talk about 
music or whatever suits our fancy.

Times after 6:30pm on weeknights and any time on weekends work well for 
most people. However, the time, place, etc is as flexible as our 
suggestions.

Notification of Information, the restaurant Address, Reservations made, 
time and date, with number of people and cost are to be determined.

All suggesetions are welcome, please bring yourself and a smile :)

Please suggest the following:
Day, Month, Date, Year

Meeting Time and Place:

Choose / suggest however you would like. Generally, the restaurant is 
picked  for the cuisine, price, location, and atmosphere. Price is 
determined by the restaurant, but we should try and pick a restaurant that 
suits everyone's budget.

Please rsvp to me by replying to this thread, sending me email @ 
karina@hyperreal.org, via IM, or in person. Email works best so I can 
track whom would like to go and have a way to contact you back for 
confirmation.

I am looking forward to meeting you in person. I appreciate the 
opportunity to meet people, bring them together and build lasting 
friendships both offline and in real-life.

Thanks and much love to you, always :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party.throwing.people+resources

Yeah, 6 rooms wasn't the ideal setup but you also have to realize the 
pressures with "fitting everyone in" who may have stake in the party and 
the resulting dramas and how they are dealt with. Where it gets crazy in 
this place is at the point when whole groups say, "Fuck you I am going 
to throw my party in the building when yours is happening regardless." 
That is what happened at the top of the stairs in a space rented by 
someone here at the building and there wasn't anything that could be 
done about it except "damage control" in the form of finding some way to 
include them. That is some pretty amazing fucking shit, to go from all 
the yelling and screaming at each other and the fuck yous hurled back 
and forth to what all of us presented on NYE.

I think it is downright hilarious how whenever NYE is mentioned it is 
most often referred to as FnF NYE. Maybe it was one of the worst FnF 
parties ever, but it certainly was a fantastic Otherworld party.

FnF barely had a part in the party prior to the night of and a few days 
prior, and certainly weren't there in force months ahead of the party 
planning it all out. Most of the planning of OW/FnF NYE was done by one 
person: From searching out extra spaces in our building to booking and 
paying who needed to get paid, to bringing in Radiant Atmospheres and 
arranging sound systems, to getting folks like Marin to do her awesome 
decorations and captaining that whole effort... all while most of FnF 
had better things to do than be involved early on.

The folks that did come through on the FnF side early on were mostly 
people that enjoy OW to begin with and are down with what we do 
regardless. Those are the people that really made the loading dock and 
overflow space work enough to be called "FnF." Let's be honest, it 
wasn't a full FnF effort... only an effort by the FnF people motivated 
to use parts of our space and share an event. Those people are the 
people who should be given credit for the "FnF" side of things - you 
represented your greater collective with honor and hard work. Ticketing 
and door crew were mostly handled by FnF folks. Regardless there are 
people who feel they are part of both crews - it showed in their effort.

I think it is very important to realize there was a time in the planning 
when the question was posed within our house: "Who should we invite to 
share half of our home with to throw a large NYE event? Who would 
appreciate it and make the most of it?" There were many family 
collectives considered as possibles to share our event with. Let me 
repeat that last part one more time...

WHO WOULD APPRECIATE IT AND MAKE THE MOST OF IT? It turns out those 
people are individuals not a whole "crew" to speak of.

Obviously the solution is to become more involved so you understand the 
behind the scenes issues more... or to develop the wisdom to understand 
them if you are not involved at that level. Better yet, rent out a 
30,000 square foot warehouse at more than $10k/month and start a 
collective there so you can extend your space to folks who will bitch 
about the party later and forget how drunk and bottle breaking 
belligerent they were in your home.

I hope this blanket response is illuminating to some folks in regard to 
larger production events in shared warehouse buildings.

Subject: [sfraves] Someone might live there.

Yes, this is going to come off like I am absolutely pissed and bitter so 
if you need to read fluffy optimism skip to the next Osby Oi Oi Jams sender.

There used to be a time when the kids going to undergrounds and parties 
had a sense for something really important that I see lacking in 
people's minds:

The party might be thrown in somebody's home.


It doesn't matter if the place is 1500 square feet or 30,000... it is or 
could be primarily, first and foremost... SOMEBODY'S HOME.

Wouldn't it be nice if the next time we are at an event if we could 
remember that one thing before:

making a mess
becoming drunk and belligerent
slamming up against walls uncontrollably
leaving the front door to the street open at 5am when leaving
putting out a cigarette
breaking bottles
fighting
deciding to bring social drama
destroying the shared building bathroom
tagging

whoa - i'm sorry you had such a bad experience, don.  :(

from what i saw (on the FnF end) people were planning and
prepping in advance, and were there for setup/cleanup as well.

maybe we should move this discussion over to the FnF chat or
planners list?  feedback is always good, and this is the first
i've heard of all these problems.

i had very limited involvement with the party (day of setup,
decorations, DJing), but all that i saw went pretty smooth.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party.throwing.people+resources

No, I had a great time later on and the people that did help were 
great... but it was a subset of people and time and time again this 
party keeps getting referred to as The FnF NYE... when in fact it was 
Otherworld / FnF NYE with a subset of people from both groups who really 
made it happen.

The drama I refer to was dealt with and kept out of the FnF/Otherworld 
partnership for the event, but it is one example of the crap that is 
dealt with that nobody really sees. (Along with things like checking 
certain internet message boards to make sure the bsp was taken down, 
dealing with all the internet drama and bullshit, people threatening to 
have the party shut down, etc.)  It was kept out of FnF's hair because 
it was a building issue along with all the other crap.

I just get tired of people bitching about aspects of parties they had 
only a very small part of. The worst FnF ever, then get off your lazy 
fucking primadonna ass and make it the best FnF ever for yourself or 
understand the limits of what your small role in things gives you the 
right to bitch about.

Awww poo....

I guess that shows just how out of touch I've been of late.  I didn't 
even know she quit playing hardcore.  I just thought that the Cannabass 
thing I saw was some sort of booking SNAFU, or she was friends with the 
promoters or something.  And hell... I used to make it out to most all 
of the HHC parties, too.

Oh well... I guess in this economy, you gotta do what you gotta do.  At 
least I found out about the switch now, and know not to mistakingly let 
her name draw me into some party I wouldn't enjoy.

Still a shame tho.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR > XM or Sirius? Which do I choose?

Sirius has more original programming, while XM's programming largely
comes from ClearChannel and existing syndicated radio shows. Not sure
if that has changed since ClearChannel sold most of its interest of XM
a while ago.

On the other hand, XM currently has much better EDM programming. It
carries BBC Radio One's Essential Mix, and various other DJ shows.
Sirius' EDM programming is pretty laughable in comparision. I'd
wouldn't be suprised if Sirius eventually launches more original DJ
shows and provide better EDM programming than XM, but right now XM is
much better in terms of EDM.

So if u want EDM, I'd say go with XM now. If you like radio talk
shows, I'd go with Sirius since it has all the syndicated shows that
XM carries, plus Howard Stern.

I suggest you check the XM and Sirius fan sites/forums and decide for

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR > XM or Sirius? Which do I choose?

One more thing: here's the list of DJ shows on XM's The Move.

http://www.xmradio.com/programming/channel_guide.jsp?ch=80

Weekly hosts including Deepsky, Halo Vagra, Coldcut, D:Fuse, Omid 16B,
Tom Stephan. Satoshi Tomiie, etc.

Sirius hardly has any DJ shows, they're EDM programming mainly
consists of 'round-the-clock playlists of euro-dance and handbag
clubby tunes.

I use XM Radio exclusively. Their electronic music stations are

OK, so let me get this straight... Tonight we have Hugger-Mugger with
Morpheme, Floorcraft and Iyad; Thursday's DJ Hell; Friday's Alien
Autopsy w/Surgeon, Terrac, Sticky, Disconnect, Yap and Plateshifter; and
then you expect me to make it out to DIRTY on Saturday??? I'm still
kinda recovering from LAST weekend!

Come again?

I worked parking lot/transpo coordinator from before party start till 
after midnight in the rain, dealt with the influx of underage kids who 
showed up after the modified bust, and did my best to keep people from 
getting cranky despite a considerable backup in the shuttle line.  If 
that's nothing, sorry... it's what I chose to offer that night (and more 
than I was scheduled for, there was a high chance I wasn't even going to 
be in SF Bay for NYE till maybe two weeks sprior).

Seeing as this is a direct response to my post, consider the implied 
target before using terms like "primadonna ass".  I did not disrespect 
you, but a couple readings of this aren't making your statements any 
better from my point of view.

As nothing more than an attendee I have the right to review any event on 
this list or any other channel provided I have my facts straight and 
maintain some modicum of respect.  I still said it was better than most 
parties, but again, 6 rooms, loose flyering and a lot of other factors 
contributed to a party that was not quite what I'd hoped for from either 
FnF or OW... let alone the sum of their parts (and I do stand corrected 
on referring to it as FnF NYE).

I had zero to do with the planning, but I did help the party happen and 
have been an active planning member of FnF since 1997 or so.  It's not 
like I haven't helped throw my fair share in for various crews, I know 
what it's like to hear a lackluster review of something you were 
personally involved in, but really... please don't go for the jugluar 
here.

Errm, what sort of place do you work at, exactly?  Are your IT folks
going to be savvy enough to notice that you're always running an SSH
tunnel to some outside server?  Would that be enough to raise an
eyebrow and maybe send a sysadmin rooting through your workstation?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] party.throwing.people+resources

As a newcomer to the bay area, I thought this was a kick ass party.  I
had only heard of FnF and had never had heard of Otherworld.  Out of
the slew of parties to pick from, I and my out of town friends picked
this one.  They felt the same way.  I don't know if I cared for my
favorite djs playing the puddle room, but I got down nonetheless.  And
I could tell that I wasn't the only one that did have fun.  Seemed
like the most underground party that night with the best lineup.

I'm sorry about those who chose to trash the house.  It is a reality
of party throwing in a place you call home.  Unless you and those you
work with know everyone that comes to the party, it is most likely
going to happen.  My friend's and have thrown parties for years,
outdoors, in the mountains of Santa Barbara and this reminds me of a
story.

A few of the elders and vets of the crew wandered away from the party
and had found a tagger doing his thing on a rock outside the party. 
This was at a spot that we had been doing parties for years.  We had
been able to do so cause we made sure we knew mostly everyone, made
sure everyone was safe, and left the land we used better than we found
it by picking up all the trash we and others had caused.  This
infuriated the partiers and proceeded to give him the riot act about
respect of the land, and the crew.  That actions like his would mean
we may never be able to throw parties there again, that what he was
calling his art was really just vandalism of nature, no better than
starting a fire or dumping chemicals there.  He tried to claim being
1/16th indian and his actions as going back to his roots but the tag
was lacking of much originality.  My friends ended up making him
scrape it off with a smaller rock.

Remember, the party is always what you make of it.  There will always
be an unwanted element, big or small, that will attend every party. 
And besides, New Years is an odd event.  To throw a party that big
with that many people, it would be a major miracle if you didn't get a
few jerks that trashed the place.  Some people do not know their
limits and there is a place for them.  It's called a club.

Subject: [sfraves] global consciousness project.  weird science.

Wow.  A numbers-machine used to detect global consciousness appears to "predict" Princess Diana's
death, 9/11, SE Asia tsunami, and global celebrations like New Years.   Being studied at
Princeton.   That's hot.

yeah, does it seem like the Bay Area is blowing up 
recently?  Not that i've been out to witness much, but.... maybe 
I should.     Hmmmm.  Maybe I should indeed.   

Been seeing a lot of Evil Breaks stuff going down.  

I think it's time to blow my brains out on crazy music.  Roll call for Thursday through comedown
Sunday?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] global consciousness project.  weird science.

The problem with this experiment is that they choose
the events after the fact.  That is they observe an
anomoly in the random data stream, and then try to
find an event that explains it.

The right way to do this experiment is to define the
events a priori using some sort of rules or criteria
to define the events.  For example, any incident
reported where more than 100 people die.  Or more than
100 people gather to protest war. Or etc...

Other possible explanations include solar activity,
changes in the earths electro-magnetic field, EM
fields from technological systems such as TV, radio,
computers, etc.

The REG devices have applications in cryptography
(Google "one time pad") and so any observed global
correlation effect would have significant importance
even if it was not caused by consciousness or
compassion.

Regards,

Peter

P.S. Yes I actually studied these experiments
(actually the previous version known as PEAR) in a
prior life.

Ultimately, if you are not supposed to use it, then, don't. Somehow or another, you will eventually get caught or get yourself into trouble for something. Tell your wifey to stop calling you. Or get one of those SideKick things.

neither one is a realistic option.

our IT dude is just following orders, and i'm sure he won't be trying 
to root me out.  he really couldn't give a flyin' fuck what we do, so 
long as we're not burning the place down. i just want to be discreet 
enough to use it every so often without making him feel like he has to 
come down on me.. er, US - it's really most of my department that uses 
IM.

thanks for all your suggestions. i'm trying to sort out this SSH thing.

Subject: [sfraves] Atlanta! =)

www.lunarmagazine.com - this is your sfraves of Atlanta.

The guy that runs it is the buyer for Satellite Records here. Really
nice guy and he's the one that got me to check out his site. Sure
enough there's a good amount of people on there and everyone is quite
nice. Think bayraves rah rah rah minus the idiotic candy kid//high
school OMG OMG mentality. Oh and about 25% of the traffic. Point being
- if you're ever in Atlanta get on that forum and you'll find the
party scene here quickly.

Half of DeepDish is playiing this weekend at a club called *1150*  Now
is it just me or is that a tad funny//odd that it's their big club
here and ours is 1015. Just shift the zero and... yeah. Thought that
to be a tad amusing. I gotta say that they do bring in some good out
of town talent. On one flyer one of the guys in Sound Navigators
played last week. Had I known I would have gone. Damn!

I'll be taking a lot of pictures from when Dubfire plays this
saturday. There are some UG afterparties too apparently so I'll be
sure to hit those up and come back with a review.

Subject: [sfraves] wanna play at Hugger-Mugger? (BSP, I guess)

We're seeking new talent for upcoming guest slots at the bay area's only
techno weekly. All of the residents (AndyW, Claire, Forest, Juan, Li and
myself) have some specific tastes, but as a whole we're a lot more
open-minded than most promoters in the bay area. :)

What I'm specifically looking for is more along the lines of IDM and
weird acid tracks. Glitchy stuff is right up my alley too, so if you
play anything abstract and noisey, I'd be interested in hearing some of
it--as long as it's not too aggro. Anything that could be described as
"deep", "dubby" and "minimal" works for me. Experimental trip-hop and
anything else along those lines could work as well.

If that sounds like something you can do, send me an email. I'd prefer
to listen to MP3s, but if you want to send me a CD let me know and I'll
give you my address. My next night to book is 3/8, but if I like your
stuff and the lineup is full I'll gladly recommend you to one of the
other residents. And of course, if you play (or make, we're up for live
acts too) anything that I'm not particularly into, don't hesitate to hit
me up for the other residents' contact info.

Thanks,
--

Artists participating in a group show being held at the Big Easy's 
charmingly bizarre Barrister's Gallery through March 27 are getting a 
little taste of what their lives might be like after they are dead.

"What are memorials to the dead but touchstones for the great post-mortem 
popularity contest? He whose gravestone draws the biggest crowds wins," 
said <http://www.barristersgallery.com>gallery owner Andy Antippas, who is 
curating Hydriotaphia: New Orleans Artists Design Their Own Funeral Urns 
with artist Dan Teague.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] traffic jams, chaos theory, and community

abcnews is just now picking up on this story about traffic jams,  which was a model used years ago
by chaos theorists  trying discover an order of happenstances in Nature.  

http://userfs.cec.wustl.edu/~ce560/The%20Physics%20of%20Gridlock%20-%2000_12.htm

the idea is that many traffic jams happen for "no reason"-- no accident, no mattress in lane 3,
but instead, the fact that 15 minutes ago, a driver miles ahead of you tapped her brake pedal at a
time & place that was perfect for creating a chain reaction that leads to a meaningless traffic
jam.

why's this important?  i guess because it reminds us that what we do know might influence events
long after we've made a decision, turned it into an action,  and waltzed away to the next scene. 

Spiritualists of the Chaos vein tell us that this is why we should do *good things.*  But what
about the chain of events that might cause an act of charity to result in terrible things?  (Like
helping some diseased geezer across the street stalls the traffic flow enough to allow a taxicab
to flatten your beloved fiance 10 blocks away)

I need to do some more math.  Until then, PLEASE don't do anything.  Opening windows and doors is
particularly risky, especially if your crib is dusty or you have a mischievious cat.

If you *must* do something,  try to make it a positive interaction.  

Some scientists believe that positive actions make the subject feel like rotten ass, but I have
another theory: that positive actions make the subject feel good, even if the action results in
the subject's lover being flattened by a taxicab.  

I just need batteries for my calculator.  And a glass of Scotch to take the wack out of this weed.

Subject: [sfraves] Nothing Left but the Future--mailing more CDs--free of course (bsp)

I'm mailing Jonas a new copy of my CD because the first was a dud.  If anyone wants to be included
in the mailing, send me your snail address.  My last offer was during the holidays when some
people were off-list.  If you asked but never received,  let me know.

Four breakbeat / downtempo tracks.  All composed by Boomerang, entirely from samples.  Plus an
unauthorized remix.

1.   Wanderers			
2.   Your A Idiot   (((Everybody Hates Me mix)))
3.   Ready to Go   (((Goa Trance Kids mix)))
4.   Ayahuasca		
5.   bonus track:      Bucephalus Bouncing Ball - by Aphex Twin 	
       (Boomerangs unauthorized Human-Robot Sex mix) 	
_______
Some interesting samples used: 

(1) Wanderers   
Artists: For voice samples, Wanderers was based almost entirely on astronomer/philosopher Carl
Sagan reading his book Pale Blue Dot.  Other audio text from Frank Herbert (author of Dune)     
Films: Total Eclipse   --[among others]--

(2) Your a Idiot     
Artists: Joe Frank, Beastie Boys (Q-Tip vox), Disasterous Customer Service      
Films: Friday, Ghost World, Full Metal Jacket, Macarthur Park, George B., Zoolander, Scary Movie,
The Score   --[among others]--

(3) Ready to Go   
Artists:  The Greaseman, Khalil, Eazy-E  & NWA, Dr. Dre, US3.     
Films:  Scary Movie 2, Dead Man on Campus, Mr. Deeds, Artificial Intelligence, The Heist,
Zoolander;     --[among others]--  
     
(4) Ayahuasca      
Artists: Carl Sagan, Frank Herbert, radio dub of unknown author      
Films: Dopamine, Powder (Goldblum) --[among others]

(5) Bucephalus Bouncing Ball (boomerangs Human-Robot Sex remix)  
Artists: Bucephalus Bouncing Ball by Aphex Twin, in its entirety.  Apologies to Richard James for
my unauthorized overdub of his song.  The Aphex Twin song is a breath-taking mess of jungle music
fallen to beautiful catastrophe. 
Artists: Isaac Asimov,  George Herbert, Kraftwerk (we are robots),  Styx (mr. roboto), Carl Sagan
(Pale Blue Dot), microphone visionary Mike Patton (faith no more) for inspiration and samples from
his Robot Sex recordings, DJ 7Ups dj tools.       
Films:  Gregorys Girl, I Robot, Artificial Intelligence, Alien Hunter, the Banger Sisters, Total
Eclipse,  the Heist,

Apologies for any copyright credits  that have been overlooked.

the 5 tracks i just mentioned are new [WInter 05].  the Fila Brazilla dub is years old & has been
on a lot of my past CDs.  My friends suggested I narrow "Nothing Left"  down to just original
and/or new tracks to avoid confusion about what's what's new or what's original.     

I have a habit of recycling & renovating & re-rereleasing.... but not everyone appreciates it.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: JJ Islas on An Epiphany Of Sound today

JJ Islas will be making a return appearance on An Epiphany Of Sound this
morning, between 9a and Noon.  He plans to focus on the Drum n Bass
spectrum of things, but I'd bet he'll be meandering outside of that
limitation also.  So listen in and find out for yourself.  90.1 FM in
the bay area and online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Peace.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] traffic jams, chaos theory, and community

Well see its not that things happen for "no reason"
its just that the real reasons aren't as impressive as
we'd like them to be.  The woman tapping on her brake
might be the reason for a traffic jam an hour later,
but that doesn't satisfy us as an explanation.  We
need the matress in lane 3 to make us feel safe and
warm.

Also chaos theory (the math not the magic) tells us
that without precise knowledge of the initial
conditions we can't predict the behavior of certain
types of systems even over very short time periods. 
So while it might be true that the woman tapping on
her brakes caused the traffic jam, we'll never be able
to know that unless we track every single car on the
freeway with perfect accuracy.

Yes I studied this shit back in the day at UC Santa
Cruz, with folks like Ralph Abraham
(http://www.ralphabraham.org) and John Guckenheimer. 
My professors were sneaking off into a basement to
watch dripping faucets
(http://www.aerialpress.com/aerial/drip.html), the
grad students were developing shoe born computers to
predict roulette wheel outrcomes and make some cash in
Vegas (http://www.thomasbass.com/work2.htm), and the
rest of us were tramping around wide eyed in Elfland
(http://www.lifeamgood.com/01aprsanta.html) and what I
and my friends called the Pits of Foulness, the waist
deep muddy pits behind the campus often surrounded by
giant toadstools, looking for God or the devil or
maybe just our car keys.  Which way leads back to the
witches circle?

FWIW Ralph Abraham is an amazing teacher who can
demonstrate the truth of a complex mathematical
theorem with a single drawing.  Taking classes from
him was trully eye opening.  He also did some things
with Terrance McKenna and is an ally of Eros, Gaia,
and magick.

See also http://www.techgnosis.com/trialogue.html

And another weird but interesting link I foudn in
writing this:
http://www.jamesmith.com/archives/2005/01/computational_a.html#endnote_ref_1

FWIW I can't stomach Scotch.

HEADLINE: The Turn Away From the Turntable

BYLINE: By SIMON REYNOLDS

BODY:


IN the first months of 2005, two of electronic dance music's biggest
bands will release what are generally referred to as long-awaited
albums. But what's uncertain is how many people are actually waiting
to greet the Chemical Brothers' ''Push the Button,'' out this week, or
Daft Punk's ''Human After All,'' due in March. If the humiliatingly
lukewarm response to last fall's comeback albums by the top dance acts
the Prodigy and Fatboy Slim is any measure, neither Daft Punk nor the
Chemical Brothers ought to bank on teeming throngs at the record
stores or a warm radio welcome.

During the halcyon days of the late 90's, these groups were the Big
Four of crossover electronica, their music fusing techno's pounding
machine rhythms with anthemic hooks and hard riffs that worked as well
on rock radio as they did on the dance floor. The Prodigy's success
eclipsed everybody else's (''The Fat of the Land'' sold nearly three
million copies in America alone), but Daft Punk and Chemical Brothers
enjoyed MTV hits (''Da Funk'' and ''Setting Sun,'' respectively),
while tracks by Fatboy Slim achieved ubiquity via movie soundtracks
and TV commercials.

In those days, electronica was so trendy that Madonna jumped on two
different techno bandwagons in swift succession, assimilating the
euphoric riffs of trance with ''Ray of Light'' and aping the spangly
effervescence of French house on ''Music.'' The bullish mood in the
electronic community back then was typified by Paul Oakenfold, the
British superstar D.J., who tried to break his moistly emotional brand
of trance in America, in the belief that this country was set to be
dance music's next big commercial frontier.

Quite the opposite happened. In the new millennium, the mainstream
profile of dance music dipped alarmingly. This downturn occurred on
both sides of the Atlantic, but it was particularly precipitous in
America, where electronica was edged off of the charts by the twin
juggernauts of nu-metal and pop-punk, along with the perennial might
of hip-hop. But it wasn't just a case of mass-media gatekeepers
abandoning electronic music. Something was ailing at the grass roots
of the scene. Formerly packed superclubs began to close, or move to
smaller venues. Large raves, once the mainstay of dance culture,
became nearly extinct. ''Rave is dead in the Los Angeles area,'' says
the West Coast scene watcher Dennis Romero, who is news editor at the
dance magazine BPM.

As recently as 2001, Southern California was still the most vibrant
rave scene in America, but according to Mr. Romero, the kids just
aren't coming out to big events anymore, partly because of Ecstasy
burnout. ''The superclubs here are starting to see diminishing numbers
as well,'' Mr. Romero says, ''with popular nights like Spundae taking
a hiatus and Red closing down altogether.''

Not only were sales of crossover-oriented electronica plummeting; the
underground dance music sold in specialist record stores also
declined. Some of those shops have closed because business is slow and
record labels are suffering. ''People I know who run labels keep
getting worse and worse news,'' says William Linn, a San
Francisco-based dance party promoter. ''Partly it's because of the
Internet, people just taking the music for free. But it's also because
people aren't buying the stuff in the way they were when the music was
a really new thing back in the early 90's.'' During that rave culture
heyday, an underground anthem could sell anywhere from 10,000 to
50,000 copies. Today, shifting a thousand copies of a 12-inch single
is considered a good result.

What happened? One cause is the continued fragmentation of dance
culture into myriad micro-genres with narrow aesthetic parameters and
niche followings. Another factor is musical overproduction, which
effectively divides the pie into smaller slices. But the overall pie
also seems to be shrinking as well. Dance music has simply lost the
ear of the floating consumer. This may be, in part, a matter of
fashion: electronic dance music had been around long enough to lose
its ''new kid on the subcultural block'' status. The music had become
familiar, and familiarity bred ennui.

Other genres have certainly suffered this kind of problem; dance music
is going through the kind of midlife crisis that afflicts any genre
that's been around a while (think rock music in the 1980's). ''We're
just waiting for the next Big New Thing in dance music to come
along,'' says Norman Cook, the man behind Fatboy Slim. ''Right now
we're between New Things, and no one quite knows what the next one
will be.''

The central idea of electronic music's unwritten manifesto was always
to surge full-tilt into the future. But in recent years many creators
of dance music have been investigating the genre's own history,
reworking ideas from electro, synthpop and Italodisco. Even more
oddly, others have been looking to rock music for reinvigoration. Mr.
Cook's ''Palookaville'' used rock instrumentation (guitar and bass)
and more conventional verse/chorus song structures. Last year's
biggest dancefloor anthem was Alter Ego's ''Rocker,'' whose simple,
chugging rhythm and squealing riffs are transparently modeled on heavy
metal. Swaths of Daft Punk's new album, ''Human After All,'' resemble
an electronicized version of hard rock. Two highly touted early 2005
albums, the self-titled debut from LCD Soundsystem and Mu's ''Out of
Breach,'' have a rough-hewn, ''live'' garage punk feel to much of
their contents.

Other currently hot outfits like Black Strobe, Tiefschwarz and Kiki
hark back to 80's alternative rock genres like Goth and industrial.
Kiki's ''End of the World,'' for instance, features the Finnish-born
producer paying vocal homage to the doomy, hollow-drone baritone of
Andrew Eldritch of the goth-rock gods Sisters of Mercy. Perhaps the
most bizarre example of dance music ransacking rock's archives was
last year's fad for schaffel (German for shuffle), which involved
producers renovating the stomping rhythms of 70's glam rock artists
like T. Rex and Gary Glitter. It's hard to say whether all these
different forms of rockified techno represent a subconscious attempt
by the scene to ingratiate its way back into the mainstream, or are
simply a case of producers looking for genre-crossing thrills. But
none of them exactly restake dance music's claim as the music of the
future.

Alongside its commitment to constant innovation, another central tenet
of dance culture was the idea of being underground, an outlaw scene.
In the early days, dance culture was oriented around one-off raves in
unusual locations, often involving organizers breaking into warehouses
or invading outdoor spaces. Proper safety codes were rarely observed,
drugs were rife and the behavior of the participants verged on
anarchy. Gradually, the thrills and dangers of raves were replaced by
the more reliable pleasures offered by superclubs -- organized by
professionals and regularly scheduled but still fairly wild in terms
of drug-fueled hedonism.

Today, the action is mostly in small clubs -- like APT (419 West 13th
Street) and Ikon (610 West 56th Street) in Manhattan -- in some cases
barely more than glorified bars. There, the audience exudes a
clean-cut, metrosexual aura. At times it feels as if the room has been
teleported to a chic bar in Barcelona or Berlin, especially as, more
often than not, the D.J. is from Europe. Germany, in particular, is
the spiritual homeland for American dance hipsters these days. Most of
the leading labels -- Kompakt, B-Pitch Control, Playhouse, Get
Physical -- are based there. In fact, some North American D.J.'s and
producers like Richie Hawtin have moved to Germany because the climate
for electronic music is more supportive.

If neither sonic futurism nor underground edginess apply any longer,
electronic dance music's remaining raison d'etre is, well, dancing.
But in recent years it may have been beaten on the shake-your-booty
front by dancehall and Southern rap. In response, some dance producers
have started to draw upon raucously vibrant ''street'' beats: crunk,
Miami bass, dancehall, grime and so forth.

The result is a growing hybrid genre, highlighted on the recent,
excellent compilation ''Shockout,'' known as ''breakcore.'' Purveyed
by artists like DJ/Rupture and Teamshadetek, the music combines
rumbling basslines, fidgety beats and grainy ragga vocals to create a
home-listening surrogate for the ''bashment'' vibe of a Jamaican sound
system party. Others within the breakcore genre, like Knifehandchop,
Kid 606 and Soundmurderer, hark back to rave's own early days, their
music evoking the rowdy fervor of a time when huge crowds flailed
their limbs to a barrage of abstract noise and convulsive rhythm. It's
a poignant aural mirage of a time when techno music was made for the
popular vanguard rather than a connoisseurial elite, as it is today.

Today's sharpest contemporary dance music operators, like Tiefschwarz
or LCD Soundsystem, are roughly equivalent to recombinant rock auteurs
of the 90's like PJ Harvey and Pavement, who generated sounds that
weren't strictly innovative but managed to somehow feel original.
Tiefschwarz's brothers-in-production duo Ali and Basti Schwarz and
LCD's James Murphy have an almost scholarly knowledge of dance music
history. They're adept at getting period sounds, but they combine them
in fresh ways.

On LCD's album and Tiefschwarz's superb remix collection ''Misch
Masch,'' we don't really encounter the shock of the new; instead we
get the frisson of novelty, subtle twists and cunning permutations
within an established form. Which will have to be enough for now,
until dance music producers once again figure out how to smack
listeners upside the head with sonic strangeness.

rn Away From the Turntable<BR><BR>BYLINE: By SIMON REYNOLDS<BR><BR>BODY:<BR>=
<BR><BR>IN the first months of 2005, two of electronic dance music's biggest=
<BR>bands will release what are generally referred to as long-awaited<BR>alb=
ums. But what's uncertain is how many people are actually waiting<BR>to gree=
t the Chemical Brothers' ''Push the Button,'' out this week, or<BR>Daft Punk=
's ''Human After All,'' due in March. If the humiliatingly<BR>lukewarm respo=
nse to last fall's comeback albums by the top dance acts<BR>the Prodigy and=20=
Fatboy Slim is any measure, neither Daft Punk nor the<BR>Chemical Brothers o=
ught to bank on teeming throngs at the record<BR>stores or a warm radio welc=
ome.<BR><BR>During the halcyon days of the late 90's, these groups were the=20=
Big<BR>Four of crossover electronica, their music fusing techno's pounding<B=
R>machine rhythms with anthemic hooks and hard riffs that worked as well<BR>=
on rock radio as they did on the dance floor. The Prodigy's success<BR>eclip=
sed everybody else's (''The Fat of the Land'' sold nearly three<BR>million c=
opies in America alone), but Daft Punk and Chemical Brothers<BR>enjoyed MTV=20=
hits (''Da Funk'' and ''Setting Sun,'' respectively),<BR>while tracks by Fat=
boy Slim achieved ubiquity via movie soundtracks<BR>and TV commercials.<BR><=
BR>In those days, electronica was so trendy that Madonna jumped on two<BR>di=
fferent techno bandwagons in swift succession, assimilating the<BR>euphoric=20=
riffs of trance with ''Ray of Light'' and aping the spangly<BR>effervescence=
 of French house on ''Music.'' The bullish mood in the<BR>electronic communi=
ty back then was typified by Paul Oakenfold, the<BR>British superstar D.J.,=20=
who tried to break his moistly emotional brand<BR>of trance in America, in t=
he belief that this country was set to be<BR>dance music's next big commerci=
al frontier.<BR><BR>Quite the opposite happened. In the new millennium, the=20=
mainstream<BR>profile of dance music dipped alarmingly. This downturn occurr=
ed on<BR>both sides of the Atlantic, but it was particularly precipitous in<=
BR>America, where electronica was edged off of the charts by the twin<BR>jug=
gernauts of nu-metal and pop-punk, along with the perennial might<BR>of hip-=
hop. But it wasn't just a case of mass-media gatekeepers<BR>abandoning elect=
ronic music. Something was ailing at the grass roots<BR>of the scene. Former=
ly packed superclubs began to close, or move to<BR>smaller venues. Large rav=
es, once the mainstay of dance culture,<BR>became nearly extinct. ''Rave is=20=
dead in the Los Angeles area,'' says<BR>the West Coast scene watcher Dennis=20=
Romero, who is news editor at the<BR>dance magazine BPM.<BR><BR>As recently=20=
as 2001, Southern California was still the most vibrant<BR>rave scene in Ame=
rica, but according to Mr. Romero, the kids just<BR>aren't coming out to big=
 events anymore, partly because of Ecstasy<BR>burnout. ''The superclubs here=
 are starting to see diminishing numbers<BR>as well,'' Mr. Romero says, ''wi=
th popular nights like Spundae taking<BR>a hiatus and Red closing down altog=
ether.''<BR><BR>Not only were sales of crossover-oriented electronica plumme=
ting; the<BR>underground dance music sold in specialist record stores also<B=
R>declined. Some of those shops have closed because business is slow and<BR>=
record labels are suffering. ''People I know who run labels keep<BR>getting=20=
worse and worse news,'' says William Linn, a San<BR>Francisco-based dance pa=
rty promoter. ''Partly it's because of the<BR>Internet, people just taking t=
he music for free. But it's also because<BR>people aren't buying the stuff i=
n the way they were when the music was<BR>a really new thing back in the ear=
ly 90's.'' During that rave culture<BR>heyday, an underground anthem could s=
ell anywhere from 10,000 to<BR>50,000 copies. Today, shifting a thousand cop=
ies of a 12-inch single<BR>is considered a good result.<BR><BR>What happened=
? One cause is the continued fragmentation of dance<BR>culture into myriad m=
icro-genres with narrow aesthetic parameters and<BR>niche followings. Anothe=
r factor is musical overproduction, which<BR>effectively divides the pie int=
o smaller slices. But the overall pie<BR>also seems to be shrinking as well.=
 Dance music has simply lost the<BR>ear of the floating consumer. This may b=
e, in part, a matter of<BR>fashion: electronic dance music had been around l=
ong enough to lose<BR>its ''new kid on the subcultural block'' status. The m=
usic had become<BR>familiar, and familiarity bred ennui.<BR><BR>Other genres=
 have certainly suffered this kind of problem; dance music<BR>is going throu=
gh the kind of midlife crisis that afflicts any genre<BR>that's been around=20=
a while (think rock music in the 1980's). ''We're<BR>just waiting for the ne=
xt Big New Thing in dance music to come<BR>along,'' says Norman Cook, the ma=
n behind Fatboy Slim. ''Right now<BR>we're between New Things, and no one qu=
ite knows what the next one<BR>will be.''<BR><BR>The central idea of electro=
nic music's unwritten manifesto was always<BR>to surge full-tilt into the fu=
ture. But in recent years many creators<BR>of dance music have been investig=
ating the genre's own history,<BR>reworking ideas from electro, synthpop and=
 Italodisco. Even more<BR>oddly, others have been looking to rock music for=20=
reinvigoration. Mr.<BR>Cook's ''Palookaville'' used rock instrumentation (gu=
itar and bass)<BR>and more conventional verse/chorus song structures. Last y=
ear's<BR>biggest dancefloor anthem was Alter Ego's ''Rocker,'' whose simple,=
<BR>chugging rhythm and squealing riffs are transparently modeled on heavy<B=
R>metal. Swaths of Daft Punk's new album, ''Human After All,'' resemble<BR>a=
n electronicized version of hard rock. Two highly touted early 2005<BR>album=
s, the self-titled debut from LCD Soundsystem and Mu's ''Out of<BR>Breach,''=
 have a rough-hewn, ''live'' garage punk feel to much of<BR>their contents.<=
BR><BR>Other currently hot outfits like Black Strobe, Tiefschwarz and Kiki<B=
R>hark back to 80's alternative rock genres like Goth and industrial.<BR>Kik=
i's ''End of the World,'' for instance, features the Finnish-born<BR>produce=
r paying vocal homage to the doomy, hollow-drone baritone of<BR>Andrew Eldri=
tch of the goth-rock gods Sisters of Mercy. Perhaps the<BR>most bizarre exam=
ple of dance music ransacking rock's archives was<BR>last year's fad for sch=
affel (German for shuffle), which involved<BR>producers renovating the stomp=
ing rhythms of 70's glam rock artists<BR>like T. Rex and Gary Glitter. It's=20=

*Ecstasy trials for combat stress*

*David Adam, science correspondent
Thursday February 17, 2005
<http://www.guardian.co.uk>*

American soldiers traumatised by fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are to be 
offered the drug ecstasy to help free them of flashbacks and recurring 
nightmares.

The US food and drug administration has given the go-ahead for the soldiers 
to be included in an experiment to see if MDMA, the active ingredient in 
ecstasy, can treat post-traumatic stress disorder.

Scientists behind the trial in South Carolina think the feelings of 
emotional closeness reported by those taking the drug could help the 
soldiers talk about their experiences to therapists. Several victims of 
rape and sexual abuse with post-traumatic stress disorder, for whom 
existing treatments are ineffective, have been given MDMA since the 
research began last year.

Michael Mithoefer, the psychiatrist leading the trial, said: "It's looking 
very promising. It's too early to draw any conclusions but in these 
treatment-resistant people so far the results are encouraging.

"People are able to connect more deeply on an emotional level with the fact 
they are safe now."

He is about to advertise for war veterans who fought in the last five years 
to join the study.

According to the US national centre for post-traumatic stress disorder, up 
to 30% of combat veterans suffer from the condition at some point in their 
lives.

Known as shell shock during the first world war and combat fatigue in the 
second, the condition is characterised by intrusive memories, panic attacks 
and the avoidance of situations which might force sufferers to relive their 
wartime experiences.

Dr Mithoefer said the MDMA helped people discuss traumatic situations 
without triggering anxiety.

"It appears to act as a catalyst to help people move through whatever's 
been blocking their success in therapy."

The existing drug-assisted therapy sessions last up to eight hours, during 
music is played. The patients swallow a capsule containing a placebo or 
125mg of MDMA - about the same or a little more than a typical ecstasy tablet.

Psychologists assess the patients before and after the trial to judge 
whether the drug has helped.

The study has provoked controversy, because significant doubts remain about 
the long-term risks of ecstasy.

Animal studies suggest that it lowers levels of the brain chemical 
serotonin, and some politicians and anti-drug campaigners have argued that 
research into possible medical benefits of illegal drugs presents a falsely 
reassuring message.

The South Carolina study marks a resurgence of interest in the use of 
controlled psychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs. Several studies in the US 
are planned or are under way to investigate whether MDMA, LSD and 
psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, can treat conditions 
ranging from obsessive compulsive disorder to anxiety in terminal cancer 
patients.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

I Have a set that I want to increase the volume for in some places but not
others.. I actually want to select the whole set and have an automatic
volume leveler set the band for lower output sections but limit the increase
to higher volume sections.  Does SoundForge do that??  The volume functions
seems rudimentary and unsophisticated that way. SoundForge 7

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR:IPOD Question

Did you use Itunes?

Do you have Itunes set to automatically update "Selected" playlists only?  

If so, check your Ipod options and see if the playlist is checked... 

Hope this helps...

Breaks doesn't go "OONTZ OONTZ OONTZ", you silly bastard, it goes,
"OONTZ TACK OONT OONT TACK" over and over and over again.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Want It Radio - sundays 3-7pm PST

--0-1727127178-1108756493=:14655
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

introducing Want It Radio, another internet radio show set to blow up speakers and piss off the neighbors. check it out sundays from 3:00 - 7:00 pm (or whenever, really, depending on how much debauchery is going down in the studio that week). links below:
 
http://radio.wantit.org
 
or, if you want to skip a step: http://www.live365.com/stations/campwantit
 
and now for a bit of history: this project actually started as a burning man camp. as we all know, any group of 30+ is bound to have some DJs hanging around, so those of us local to SF got together and decided to broadcast a show once a week. the rest of our campmates are all over the country and in canada, so this was originally a way for them to get to hear the sounds of Want It all year round. 
 
now that we've ironed out some technical kinks, we've decided to share it with the masses. it is also going to be a vehicle through which we audition DJs for performances at our camp on the playa this year. i'm going to be up to my ears in demo CDs from all over the planet, but anyone local who would rather play for us live than record a demo should drop me an email. 
 
the show is going to focus primarily on house, breaks, and techno, but there will undoubtedly be times where we dig deep into the crates and play a bit of whatever-the-fuck. if this sounds like something you can get down to, then tune in.
 
word to your gramma...
 
love,
mo

Not Your Parent's Drug Test

By <http://www.alternet.org/authors/3513/>Paul Armentano, 
<http://www.reason.com/>Reason. Posted 
<http://www.alternet.org/ts/archives/?date%5BF%5D=02&date%5BY%5D=2005&date%5Bd%5D=15&act=Go/>February 
15, 2005.

A surge in the number of Americans peeing on demand has coincided with an 
explosion of alternative drug testing technology.

One look at the 
<http://www.cozart.co.uk/articles.asp?ConferenceID=34>Cozart RapiScan, a 
self-proclaimed complete "on-site oral fluid drugs of abuse diagnostic 
system," and it's obvious: This isn't your parents' drug test. Gone are the 
golden days of the plastic collection cup. The Cozart saliva testing system 
comes in a spiffy silver suitcase and consists of an oral fluid collection 
swab, a disposable test cartridge, its own handheld digital computer, and a 
portable printer "for a permanent record of test results."

The official U.S. distributor of the RapiScan, The Dominion Diagnostics 
Corporation, was one of many hi-tech exhibitors hawking their wares in 
Tampa last spring at a meeting of corporate drug testers, toxicologists and 
law enforcement officers, sponsored, in part, by the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy (a.k.a. the drug czar's office). But this White 
House-backed gathering was no trade show. The purpose of this symposium  
and the intent of the bodily fluid snoopers in attendance  was to call for 
an unprecedented, government-mandated expansion of both drug testing and 
the application of new drug-screening technology  and not just for those 
within the workplace. And the pee police may be close to getting their wish.

willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."

Subject: [sfraves] help I've fallen down and I have an itch I can't scratch

Well not really.  

But after listening to some of the tracks and mixes on
DJ Surgeon's web site I've decided that I must
immediately buy some techno records.  

What's the best store in SF for techno?

Regards,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fwd: Simon Reynold's New York Times article  


> fuck this guy and the condescending attitude.

interesting interpretation.    Simon Reynolds isn't necessarily a pop journalist trying to create
a controversial spin.  His book "Generation Ecstasy"  is 389 pages of research into what we
lunatics do in dirty warehouses every weekend.

If his tone is condescending, he's probably doing it for journalistic objectivity (an Osby for
every AndyW, y'know )  You can't write about the importance of EDM culture without acknowledging
the negatives.  That would make it to easy for readers to dismiss as starry-eyed freshman
propaganda.

Or maybe this is the cynicism we all feel when the pills stop working.

see ya on the dance floor,
booms

He is right on here.  As I have mentioned before many times...it 
has  become an obsession with me...good music and good times arise from the 
streets, not the technician's studio.  Hip hop and house, for  example, are 
coming together again I believe as dancers search for the cock-raising, 
booty shaking  beats lost when "fashion" replaced the sweat ;-)

Things are looking up IMHO.

Love,

"Generation Ecstasy" is research lit, not poetry, dude.  

I ain't found nothing in the book that he done wrote too bad, in terms of verbs and other
grammar-type shit. 

I just briefed the book again, and it looks OK.  (It was kinda dusty.  How old am I again?)

But yo-  How does it suck, Doug?   Misinformation?  Slanted? The technical quality of the writing
seems fine.  

Maybe I missed something in the grand scheme.  But I wasn't looking for anything there that I
ain't already done learnt from a good square of blotter and Joe Rice on the decks at 4 a.m.

help me out.  i'm listening.

peace is you,
bf      :o)

Sometimes I am lost like this.

it isn't literature.  i guess that's what i was looking for.  if you're a 
music geek, like you, mr. rapper :)
it'd be a good book.  but for non-music geeks, he has an annoying writing 
style.  yeah, that's it.
as a sort-of-want-to-be-can-claim-i-know-something-about-writing writer, 
the writing was horrible and annoying
(shall i dredge up my saved e-mails relevant to this book for when it came 
out?)

Simon Reynolds' stuff

Subject: [sfraves] RR: NEED HELP! Ride from East Bay to DIRTY @ 330 RITCH??

Hey y'all...since my car is officially deceased, and my ride bailed on me I 
find myself in a predicament. I'm playing @ 9pm but it looks like I'll be 
forced to resort to BART & a cab unless I can wrangle an alternate mode of 
transportation.

If some lovely individual out there (in the East Bay) would be so kind as to 
help me with a ride, I'll make sure you get in free and I'll kick down some 
gas $$ or somethin'...I live right next to Berkeley and I'm right off the 
highway, so it's VERY easy to get to...

Thanks in advance for any help y'all can give me!!!

Much as I hate to do this, I won't have steady access to a PC all day, so if 
you can help - call me ASAP @ 510-525-3711 - thanks!

<rant>

What is it about big name DJ's that figure they don't actually have to beat 
match or do anything other than play records.. they were straight up lame.. 
we left early.. they played mixes that breaks DJ's have been playing for 
over a year as part of their new tour.. unmixed.. it was so frikkin lame.. I 
was really dissapointed in quality.. on a positive note.. thier first few 
tracks were this conglomeration of 50's style beatnick and house rythems 
that were hella funky.. but then they would put on a another record and 
actually forget to mix it in.  That was once again super lame!! They thought 
they weree soo kewl.. and people were boooing them because they didn't know 
how to mix.. they got what they deserved.. stick to the studios.. it is 
obviously all they can do.

This is all after we waiting in line with everyone else who bought in 
advance for willcall with Blasthaus.com and was forced to wait outside in 
the rain for over an hour.  I urge you never to use this lame ass ticketing 
agengy for anyhting.. they treat you like shite.  Who sells tickets for TC 
and then checks you in one at a time with no conselation for how long they 
take.. they could have had so many people running that line.. but they had 
2.  Lame ass bitches,, they suck!!

</end rant>

Then we saw satsi spin three tracks at blue cube and it made my night.. 
desert breaks.. probably the best three tracks of the night cuz he went 
longer than he was supposed too.. even though the show was supposed to go to 
4.. they shut it down at 2.. wtf.. was everything screwed up last night.. I 
think people forget how to organize when they get wet.. as My friend Lisa 
says," I'm all wet.. and not in a good way!!"

BIG BIG THANKS to Brandon & Aaron for allowing me to spin last night...I had 
a good time, and was happy to see people spilling in as I left around 11pm 
or so. (working at 6am on Sundays blows ass by the way...ugh)

The beats were pretty tasty, the spot was nice and the sound was better than 
at the last DIRTY...all good things.

Looking forward to the Evil Breaks Anniversary party - it's gonna be sick!!!

Thanks again guys...it was much appreciated!!

Good times!

So I was kinda thinking to myself how it's a breaks party.  And breaks 
people are kinda fun oriented.  And I'm kinda fun oriented, especially 
after a couple drinks.  And so is ghettotech.  And I'd seen a couple 
ghettotech DJs play lately who bust no tricks and rather than complain I 
thought it better to just go out and do some chicken right.  So I figured, 
this would be a fun ghettotech booking despite it saying that it's a 
techno room and all.

So I pack a crate of the foulest accelerated funk crap I own, and make it 
out to Dirty.

And the crossfader is just fucked.

So yeah, sorry to anybody who felt they got a less than typical Andy GT 
experience.  Not being able to cut and scratch does affect ghetto tech.  
All that said, somehow the energy in there was good and I managed to eek 
out some hotmixes and doubles crud with just the levels, so I'll chalk it 
up to 330 Ritch's excellent Long Island Iced Teas (had three of them 
*hick*, highly recommended!) and of course, the fact that people secretly 
love tracks like "Dick by the Pound" and "Tip'dat Bitch" no matter how 
they're dropped.

Didn't hear too much of the music otherwise except for settling in to 
Aaron & Brandon bumping it when we got there... good times, and as we left 
the whole breaks room was going apeshit.  Defintely would have stayed but 
the ride was leaving and alas, muni night owl service in the rain with a 
dislocated shoulder and a box of records is not my idea of fun.

andyw

(could I like, get a rain check for when you guys have a working 
crossfader Bam? ;) )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] help I've fallen down and I have an itch I can't
 scratch


Best bet is people selling collections if you like that Surgeon style 
sound (keep an eye open for Advent, Regis, Ben Long, Space Djs for more of 
that sorta sound).  Not too much coming out like that these days.  Best 
store would be Open Mind, they pack a reasonable domestic techno section, 
some imports, and an admirable backstock of used techno... both randomly 
throughout the store and also organized by label (they might even have 
label sections for Counterbalance and Downwards which put out the lion's 
share of Surgeon's best work).

It's actually funny that there has been a little bump in interest in 
techno lately.  It's a really broad genre, spanning everything from 
minimal borderline dance music to almost gabber hard stuff to tech house 
to advent style rippers to tech breaks to Joey Beltram rave classics to 
seriously experimental shit.  Even sub genres of techno like "detroit" 
span a range of sounds from Plastikman's deepest downtempo acid wobbling 
to Jeff Mill's superchaotic 2 beat asswhoopins.  Probably moreso than any 
other genre, you can load up on old records and carve out your own sound 
and not sound totally cheesy (unless you stock up on too much early Adam 
Beyer and MHS*).  Something to consider for any DJs that are starting out.

andyw

* MHS stands for Minimal Hard Shit, and it's that stuff that's just pretty 
hard, fast, sounds like it's just a drum machine and some distortion 
pedals and really does it for like 5% of any given dancefloor while boring 
the shit out of everybody else.  It's also what people are usually 
referring to when they say they hate techno which is a bummer cause techno 
really is this like bin where anything that doesn't fit anywhere else 
goes.  As in "oh, it's not 2-step or house or breaks or jungle so I'll 
just put it in here".

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Review Thievery Corporation

sorry to say, but i told you so.

waste of money, IMHO.  listen to their "mixed" albums - both
are total shit.  their DJ kicks one has GREAT tracks, but
whack-ass mixing.  the "outernational sound" one has some
horrible mixes.  some are pretty decent, tho.

very few downtempo DJs actually beatmatch.  what the fuck is
that all about?

speaking of TC, has anyone heard their "cosmic game" studio
album?  i think it's the worst piece of crap ever.  the perry
farrell song makes me want to sell all of my downtempo records.
 they might as well have done a collaboration with phil
collins.  it's that lame.

I dunno - the whole Ninja Tune camp goes above and beyond 
beatmatching...guess it depends on who you listen to tho.

TC is a much better live act than anything else...there's almost no point 
seeing em if all they're gonna do is play records.

Fuck yea man...I really wish I coulda stayed last night, cuz EB parties 
always have a fun vibe to 'em. People seem genuinely happy to be out, rather 
than the whole "show up and posture" dance club crowd.

It's a breakbeat thang. Thanks again EB crew!!!

Doh.  Wasn't singling you guys out (there are other people who play the 
stuff locally who don't do much in the way of non-euclidean crotch 
scratches and double reverse hide the hamster twiddles).  In fact, I very 
much enjoyed your last outing at Ryan's house party.

That and like, I've been a cranky bitch even when I totally don't mean it 
these last couple weeks.  No idea why.  Well, I have some theories... I 
quit smoking, laid down my motorcycle, and I'm not getting laid, but I 
digress.

Author Hunter S. Thompson Kills Himself


Monday February 21, 2005 4:31 AM

AP Photo NY123

ASPEN, Colo. (AP) - Hunter S. Thompson, the acerbic counterculture writer 
who popularized a new form of journalism in books like ``Fear and Loathing 
in Las Vegas,'' fatally shot himself Sunday night at his Aspen-area home, 
his son said. He was 67.

``Hunter prized his privacy and we ask that his friends and admirers 
respect that privacy as well as that of his family,'' Juan Thompson said in 
a statement released to the Aspen Daily News.

Pitkin County Sheriff Bob Braudis, a personal friend of Thompson, confirmed 
the death to the News. Sheriff's officials did not return calls to The 
Associated Press late Sunday.

Subject: [sfraves] Reviews: DJ Hell, Alien Autopsy, Dirty, and another brief rant

DJ Hell was OK. Too bad the space sucks. I'm really sick of the Rx
Gallery... shitty location (a guy tried to extort money out of me when I
was parking my car because he said it needed to be "protected"), shitty
sound (apparently there are residences upstairs, so there's nothing they
can do about it), shitty bar (no liqour, and they ran out of all the
good beer by like midnight), and a genuinely weird crowd. I saw a lot of
people there I knew, but that didn't really help. The opening DJ sucked,
and once it got crowded the whole place just took on this weird meat
market techno snob vibe. Like Andy said, it wasn't quite bad enough to
make me want to leave, but it wasn't good enough to make me stay either.
Dreakfast at Sparky's was way more entertaining.

Alien Autopsy was a blast, but I have some issues. First of all, I don't
particularly like hard techno. At least, I don't like the "MHS" that
some of the DJs were playing that night. I was there primarily because I
knew that most of my friends would be, and I'm supposed to be a techno
geek so supposedly my attendance was mandatory. Anyway, my favorite set
by far was Michael's, and it's a shame he played so early in the night.
I'm just going to come right out and say that this 5150 guy was really
bad; totally uninspired track selection and piss-poor mixing. Sorry
dude, it just didn't do it for me. I didn't hear much of Yap's set
because I was chillin' outside, but I came back in for Surgeon and he
was pretty good. Nothing groundbreaking, but solid and funky enough for
me to dance to for a bit. I left shortly thereafter because Michael was
sticking his finger out of his fly and acting out a tip-to-tip with
Eric. The party would have kicked a lot more ass had it been downstairs.
The crowd at the OW has also been increasingly young and ghetto lately.
There were some *really* young kids at this party, and even I felt old
when I overheard a girl say, "this is, like, an *adult* rave". When I
got home I reeked of cigarettes even though I hadn't smoked one all
night; there really should have been a dedicated (tobacco) smoking area.

Dirty was a lot of fun. I arrived really early and was a little toasty
by the time the place got bumpin'. Marco played a nice opening set, and
Bam and Aaron played some pretty funky stuff. Thanks for laying off the
cheese, guys! :) M.O.D. was playing well when I left; bonus points for
playing that breaks remix of Dave Brennan's "Drink Deep", that was hot.
The techno room was hit or miss. First of all, opening that room with
hard techno was just silly. And it got progressively worse until Andy
came on and threw down that totally sick (and, apparently, unauthorized)
ghetto-tech set. Toward the end he even mixed in some old jungle and did
a half-tempo mix into hip-hop--classy! Forest played well for the half
hour or so that I heard. It would really have been nice to hear some
more tech-housey or electro stuff in that room though. Overall, the
party was a blast. The space is nice, the drinks were well-mixed, and
the crowd was fun.

I have a general complaint about both Alien Autopsy and Dirty, and
that's the lack of musical diversity. Even if I were into hard techno, I
would not have been impressed by Alien Autopsy's lineup because I seek
VARIETY in my partying experiences. And I imagine that if half of the
audience weren't drug-addled teens, it would've been a lot more poorly
attended. Pretty much everyone I knew was outside the entire time,
offering the kids water as they stumbled out of the bathroom. Evil
Breaks should be commended for pulling off a party with two very
different styles, but the programming in the "techno" room left
something to be desired. EB deserves some of the blame, but more
importantly, DJs should know not to play really really hard stuff so
early in the evening.

In general, I think techno DJs have a lot to learn about creating some
semblance of flow in their sets, and either finding records that
actually DO something, or learning how to mix really quickly (and
skillfully) so that people like me don't get bored after 32 bars of the
same fucking distorted drum machine loops. And would it *really* hurt to
throw an electro track in every once in a while, or even break things
down with some tech-house, perhaps something with an actual BASSLINE?
Seriously, people: there's too much good music out there for everyone to
be playing that crap exclusively.

It's not like my standards are impossibly high. I know there's a time
and a place for "MHS", I just don't understand why every fucking DJ
feels the need to constantly bang it out all the time. Do any of you
seriously listen to really minimal, hard, fast stuff all day long? If
so, you're a freak. I want to be taken on a journey, which means playing
tracks that I can differentiate and process relative to one another.
There's nothing memorable for me about a party where the same
ridiculously hard stuff is played for 6 hours straight. There's no way
to pinpoint a particular moment in time because everything sounds way
too similar. And there's no talent or artistry involved in just
beatmatching two really similar records over and over again. I could
probably say the same about any style of EDM (house in particular, at
least the way it's played at most of the parties I've been to in the
past 3 years), but it's closer to my heart with techno because that's
what I like to call most of the music that I like. It pisses me off to
no end that the word "techno" is constantly soiled by all this totally
uninspired, unimaginative, and downright misrepresentative bullshit.

FWIW, I had a great weekend. I'm actually in a really good mood right
now, but I feel the need to be brutally honest because I don't want to
see the recent upsurge in techno here ruined by bad DJs. Think I'm being
a snob? Well if all you play or enjoy is hard techno, I *am* holier than
thou. Stop being so selfish with your techno ego and play something that
people can get down to without having to be whacked out on drugs.  And
for the record, allow me to share two totally different--but equally
great--techno experiences with you, just so you know I'm not a
curmudgeon:

1) Tronic Treatment in Miami at the WMC last year. Phil Kieran, Mistress
Barbara, Smith & Selway, Marco Bailey and T-1000 on the main floor at
Privilege. Only slightly drunk and without the aid of any stimulants, I
danced my *ass* off to these guys (and girl) for nearly 6 hours. Forest
Green has pictures and a broken pair of glasses that I stomped on to
prove it. Hard techno, sure, but there was something funky about it that
took things to a whole new level. Most of them were also very skillful
DJs that made appropriate use of tricks to keep things interesting. And
somebody played Carl Craig's "The Climax" over something totally minimal
and booming, which just made my night.

2) John Tejada at the most recent OW NYE. I was fucked up, but I
abstained from geeking out on all the tracks and just let his set move
my ass. After the fact, what's really great is that I can remember
specific moments, like when he played Nathan Fake's "The Sky Was Pink",
and the breakdown of Roman Flugel's "Geht's Noch" timed perfectly with
the countdown. You'd either have to be seriously jaded or just
completely brainwashed by bad music not to appreciate how good his set
was that night.

Call me a snob, I can take it. Pretty much all of the other "techno"
events I've been to in the last couple of years have just been so
disappointing. I'm not jaded yet, I just want more experiences like
those few good ones. And more importantly, I want other people to have
those experiences too, because then I have an even *better* time.
Everyone wins when you increase production value rather than sacrificing
some aspect of your party to draw a particular demographic.

Promoters, I know you hate me. But try to think of me as representative
of a small slice of the raver demo: young, geeky guys who love
electronic music and want to go out a lot, but don't necessarily like
doing lots of drugs. Our tastes may be specific when it comes to certain
styles, but you can keep us interested by mixing things up and featuring
more than one or two styles of music. Grab our attention with a
talented, diverse lineup and we'll probably buy presales. Find a good
venue, encourage your DJs to do something crazy and unexpected, and
we'll probably stay all night. Keep things fresh from party to party and
you may very well make loyal partygoers out of us.

Toodles,

Subject: [sfraves] DIRTY w/ Future Funk Squad - Saturday, Feb. 19th

Yea that was a lot of fun!

Thanks again to Aaron and Bam for having Mek and myself out.  That was 
awesome!

Got to see a lot of faces i haven't seen in a long time.  Nice seeing osby 
out there, saw Kir Krynn, Karina and a bunch of others too many to name but 
theres a few.  Future Funk Squad was dope heard him playin a lot of Remixes 
but it all sounded like it was probably his own mixes, but i don't know that 
much about the breaks scene, but thats what it sounded like. i liked them a 
lot too. i heard a rmx of Voodoo people and Spitfire by Prodigy, not too 
mention a remix of Access by Misjah, also heard he had dropped a Chem bros 
rmx in the begining.  Saw Andy W droppin the Ghetto Tech, Forest played some 
pretty dirty and nasty techno even got to check out Juan Segovia was really 
diggin his stuff too!

Thanks again for a night filled with my two favorite types of music and 
letting us be a part of it, i look forward to your next.

Writer Hunter S. Thompson Commits Suicide

1 hour, 34 minutes ago

By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer

ASPEN, Colo. - Hunter S. Thompson, the hard-living
writer who inserted himself into his accounts of
America's underbelly and popularized a first-person
form of journalism in books such as "Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas," has committed suicide.

AP Video Thompson's Story Ends with Suicide
(AP Video)
 

Thompson was found dead Sunday in his Aspen-area home
of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, sheriff's
officials said. He was 67. Thompson's wife, Anita, had
gone out before the shooting and was not home at the
time. His son, Juan, found the body.

Thompson "took his life with a gunshot to the head,"
the wife and son said in a statement released to the
Aspen Daily News. The statement asked for privacy for
Thompson's family and, using the Latin term for Earth,
added, "He stomped terra."

Neither the family statement nor Pitkin County
sheriff's officials said whether Thompson left a note.
The sheriff and the county coroner did not immediately
return telephone messages Monday.

Besides the 1972 classic about Thompson's visit to Las
Vegas, he also wrote "Fear and Loathing: On the
Campaign Trail '72." The central character in those
wild, sprawling satires was "Dr. Thompson," a
snarling, drug- and alcohol-crazed observer and
participant.

Thompson is credited alongside Tom Wolfe and Gay
Talese with helping pioneer New Journalism  or, as he
dubbed his version, "gonzo journalism"  in which the
writer made himself an essential component of the
story.

Thompson, whose early writings mostly appeared in
Rolling Stone magazine, often portrayed himself as
wildly intoxicated as he reported on such figures as
Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton (news -
web sites).

"Fiction is based on reality unless you're a
fairy-tale artist," Thompson told The Associated Press
in 2003. "You have to get your knowledge of life from
somewhere. You have to know the material you're
writing about before you alter it."

Thompson also wrote such collections as "Generation of
Swine" and "Songs of the Doomed." His first ever
novel, "The Rum Diary," written in 1959, was first
published in 1998.

Thompson was a counterculture icon at the height of
the Watergate era, and once said Nixon represented
"that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the
American character."

Thompson also was the model for Garry Trudeau's
balding "Uncle Duke" in the comic strip "Doonesbury."
He was portrayed on screen by Bill Murray in "Where
The Buffalo Roam" and Johnny Depp (news) in a film
adaptation of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."

That book, perhaps Thompson's most famous, begins: "We
were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the
desert when the drugs began to take hold."

Other books include "The Great Shark Hunt," "Hell's
Angels" and "The Proud Highway." His most recent
effort was "Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine,
and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness."

"He may have died relatively young but he made up for
it in quality if not quantity of years," Paul
Krassner, the veteran radical journalist and one of
Thompson's former editors, told The Associated Press
by phone from his Southern California home.

"It was hard to say sometimes whether he was being
provocative for its own sake or if he was just being
drunk and stoned and irresponsible," quipped Krassner,
founder of the leftist publication The Realist and
co-founder of the Youth International (YIPPIE) party.

"But every editor that I know, myself included, was
willing to accept a certain prima donna journalism in
the demands he would make to cover a particular
story," he said. "They were willing to risk all of his
irresponsible behavior in order to share his talent
with their readers."

The writer's compound in Woody Creek, not far from
Aspen, was almost as legendary as Thompson. He prized
peacocks and weapons; in 2000, he accidentally shot
and slightly wounded his assistant trying to chase a
bear off his property.

 

Born July 18, 1937, in Kentucky, Hunter Stocton
Thompson served two years in the Air Force, where he
was a newspaper sports editor. He later became a proud
member of the National Rifle Association and almost
was elected sheriff in Aspen in 1970 under the Freak
Power Party banner.

Thompson's heyday came in the 1970s, when his
larger-than-life persona was gobbled up by magazines.
His pieces were of legendary length and so was his
appetite for adventure and trouble; his purported
fights with Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner were
rumored in many cases to hinge on expense accounts for
stories that didn't materialize.

It was the content that raised eyebrows and tempers.
His book on the 1972 presidential campaign involving,
among others, Edmund Muskie, Hubert Humphrey and Nixon
was famous for its scathing opinion.

Working for Muskie, Thompson wrote, "was something
like being locked in a rolling box car with a vicious
200-pound water rat." Nixon and his "Barbie doll"
family were "America's answer to the monstrous Mr.
Hyde. He speaks for the werewolf in us."

Humphrey? Of him, Thompson wrote: "There is no way to
grasp what a shallow, contemptible and hopelessly
dishonest old hack Hubert Humphrey is until you've
followed him around for a while."

The approach won him praise among the masses as well
as critical acclaim. Writing in The New York Times in
1973, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt worried Thompson might
someday "lapse into good taste."

"That would be a shame, for while he doesn't see
America as Grandma Moses depicted it, or the way they
painted it for us in civics class, he does in his own
mad way betray a profound democratic concern for the
polity," he wrote. "And in its own mad way, it's
damned refreshing."

Subject: [sfraves] nrr did Bush smoke pot?

this is fucking hilarious...especially because the
journalist's last name who taped him doing this is
coincidently "wead" heheh:)


Sun Feb 20, 7:02 PM ET

By Sue Pleming

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President George W. Bush (news
- web sites) has indicated in interviews secretly
taped by a friend before he became president that he
used marijuana but would not admit it for fear of
setting a bad example for children.

Reuters Photo

 

Portions of the tapes, recorded from 1998 to 2000 by
author Doug Wead without Bush's knowledge, were aired
on ABC News on Sunday and published by The New York
Times. Their authenticity was verified by the media
outlets but has not been independently checked by
Reuters.

"I wouldn't answer the marijuana question. You know
why? Because I don't want some little kid doing what I
tried," Bush purportedly says on the tape.

He added: "But you got to understand, I want to be
president. I want to lead. I want to set -- Do you
want your little kid say, 'Hey, Daddy, President Bush
(news - web sites) tried marijuana, I think I will?'"

In the tape, Bush mocks former Vice President Al Gore
(news - web sites) -- who fought him for the
presidency in 2000 -- for admitting he smoked
marijuana.

White House officials did not dispute the tapes'
veracity and indicated the president was disappointed
by their release.

"These were casual conversations that then Gov. Bush
was having with someone he thought was a friend, and
that's what they are," White House spokesman Scott
McClellan told reporters traveling with Bush to Europe
aboard Air Force One.

NOT AWARE

McClellan said Bush, who was governor of Texas when
the tapes were made, was not aware he was being
recorded and the White House found out only when
contacted by the New York Times for comment.

"Look, I think that, one, the comments in the tapes
speak for themselves. And two, I think that what I
just said pretty much speaks for itself," McClellan
said when pressed about the details.

"Those were issues that were addressed ad nauseam four
years ago and they were conversations that took place
more than four years ago," he said, adding that Bush
had not been in contact with Wead for several years.

Wead, a former aide to Bush's father President George
H.W. Bush, released portions of the tapes to coincide
with the publication of his new book and told ABC he
made the tapes because he believed the president was
an historic figure.

"If I'd had a chance to tape record Gandhi or had
conversations with Churchill, I probably would have
recorded them too," he said.

He also insisted his goal was not to hurt the
president's credibility and said if this were the case
he would have released the tapes during the 2004
election campaign.

Asked about the tapes in an interview with CNN, the
president's father said he was not aware of them and
declined comment.

Sitting next to Bush was ex-President Bill Clinton
(news - web sites), who admitted to smoking marijuana
when he campaigned for the White House but said he
never inhaled the illegal drug.

The two former presidents are touring areas affected
by the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr did Bush smoke pot?

yeah, there's that, the=20

'looking out for the kids'=20

bit which sounds all good and all, but a more salient question,
methinks, is how many Texans got locked up and had their lives
disrupted over marijuana use while he was Governor, and how many have
gone through this process while he's been President?

At least one 'Homicide by Justice' comes to mind:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10798-2004Oct29.html

If that's not cold-blooded murder, over nothing, I don't know what is.

When Prohibition got lifted in 1933, Roosevelt shared a Martini with the Na=
tion.
( http://www.thatsthespirit.com/en/Mixology/articles/martini.asp=20
/olive green sidebar, lower right hand)

Would that we would see that kind of Leadership from the White House today.

Nope, way too much money in keeping it 'illicit,' and keeping those
addictive Xanax scrips flowing.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reviews: DJ Hell, Alien Autopsy, Dirty, and another
 brief rant

I do agree with you on the lack of diversity in the techno scene right
now, and I've thought about this a lot....

I hate to say it, but I think the hard hard hard ass stuff is what techno
kids want at present.  I've found that with our DEF events, people have
been happiest when we've given them straight-up hard techno.  The times
we've tried to branch out an explore different sides of techno were not
exactly our most successful events.  When we threw Robot Feelings, a
techno and electro party at Cellspace last year, the Droid Behavior guys
who came up for the party complained that we weren't "techno enough".  I
want to do parties the way I like them, but I want to make the people who
attend happy too.  This may be an impossibility, as we're not quite
"techno enough" for techno kids I guess.

Alien Autopsy satisfied all the usual techno party requirements.  Dark;
check. Hard; check. Spooky and evil; check. Anoraks; well, I didn't see
any, but I'm sure there must have been an anorak or two being worn there
somewhere.  And I did notice a few bald guys.  Maybe techno ravers don't
want their party formula to be messed with.  It seems to me that this is
how they like it.  There was no question of this party not being "techno
enough".  It had all the bases covered, and people loved it.

There are so many different facets of the SF techno scene, lots of little
micro-scenes. I would love to see the scene become more united, but the
problem with techno snobs is that they get so into their thing that they
have a hard time looking beyond their own subgenre oriented microscene.

Maybe this is a bad analogy, but I see it like this--  The Democratic
party has become increasingly weak because of all the squabbling and
divisions within the party, whereas the Republican party is much more
united and unfortunately has become a lot stronger than the Democrats
because of their unity and passion.  Despite the lack of quality in the
trance scene, the enthusiasm and unity found in the candy kid world has
kept the trance scene alive and strong long after we've all declared it
dead several times. SF's techno scene, like the Democrats, will never be
strong if we continue to be divided along sub-genre lines.  Furthermore,
your average techno fan now, after seeing their music be ignored by most
rave promoters and regularly get confused with trance, has become jaded
and apathetic.  If we are divided, jaded, and apathetic, techno will be
going nowhere fast!

I want to see anorak-wearing minimal guys dancing to funky techno! I want
nosebleed schranz DJs to start buying electro records!  I want to see
people support the techno scene with enthusiasm and passion! And I have no
problem with hearing janky piano riffs in techno tracks!

Perhaps you have been slightly dissapointed with recent techno events, but
things are changing.  This is going to be our year.  ;)


Love Chelsea


P.S.  I think you would have enjoyed Terrac and Disconnect's sets on
Friday night, though they were on pretty late so most people missed them.
(except for the contents of that e-puddle in the corner....).  I had never
heard Terrac play before, he was really great.  Good track selection, good
mixing, and I'm always happy when someone plays Chris Jackson's "Check Our
Beats"!   Sean played some cool stuff too, hypnotic, groovy, and melodic.
A couple new Adam Beyer tracks, some Kanzleramt stuff, and somehow he fit
Messiah's "Temple of Dreams" in there too.  Nice!

'scuse my ignorance - but aren't Anorak's the type of jacket that the Mods & 
Northern Soul kids used to wear???

Is this some odd new techno trend?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reviews: DJ Hell, Alien Autopsy, Dirty, and another brief rant

ok.  here's my take:


what ever happened to playing a lil minimal glitchy
funk, hard shit, electro, tracky swingy stuff, breaks
and beat-less stuff all in ONE SET???  why the pigeon
holing?

shit.  every time i play i try and be super
diverse...cover a lot of different techno and its
derivatives.  i can't remember the last time i played
straight up techno!  actually, i can't remember the
last time i played!  hahaa.  the problem i see, and
i've been around for a loooooong time, is that these
'newish' techno dj's have NO BALLS!  they're scared of
their own shadows and aren't willing to take any
chances!  and like shawn was saying, who the hell
wants to hear a distorted tech loop for 6 minutes
[besides me]?  quick mixing is the key, and there
aren't a lot of techno dj's that i've seen in SF that
can do it effectively.  perhaps they're barking up the
wrong tree?  maybe they should be playing 'songs'
instead of 'tracks'.  you can't 'pretend' to be a
techno dj like these fucking trance dj's can.  they
can 'wing' their way through a set because they take
no chances and play 'songs' that do everything for
them.  lame.

my answer = fucking practice and show off your skills.
 either that or stop playing techno and pick up some
house or trance records or something..

my 4 cents...thats right...inflation bitches!

No no, I mean those rain jackets with hoods that techno nerd guys wear.
You know?

I believe there is even a minimal producer called Anorak if I'm not
mistaken.

Maybe my noticing techno cliches just means I spend too much time around
techno nerds?

Love Chelsea

Those of you who have been around for awhile remember Mark Ameba.

I recently ran into him again on Tribenet as he begins to expand his 
network, or as Mark puts it:  "so now since tribe looks like craigslist 
meets friendster...maybe I'll visit more...in the meantime shoot me a 
message and join my net..... "

Mark has a "tribe" and is throwing a party called "Naked Funk."  Old 
friends might want to connect again :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reviews: DJ Hell, Alien Autopsy, Dirty, and another
 brief rant

I think it's not just the techno DJs that have no balls, but the listeners
too.  I often see people leave the dancefloor in droves when a DJ pulls
out a different style. No wonder newer techno DJs are afraid to be
adventurous!  We all say that we want variety, but when it's given to us
we won't accept it.  This obsessive subgenre loyalty could be the downfall
of the techno scene, in my opinion.

I would love to see both techno DJs and techno ravers open up to more
styles.... But alas, I can't force people to like music they don't like.

It seems there has been a little surge of interest in techno lately.  If
we all drop the cliquey "I only like my kind of techno" thing and come
together for once, new people might actually take interest and help our
scene to grow.  If there is a renewed interest in techno and new blood
coming into the scene, more and hopefully better parties will pop up, good
techno DJs will be getting more gigs, and we will all be complaining less.
Wait.... no.. this is SFR I'm talking about here... we live for
complaining.

Variety in techno, unity under techno, a greater sense of community, and a
welcoming attitude towards newcomers.... That's what I'd like to see
happen this year.  Maybe I'm idealistic.

Love Chelsea

We both have. And I don't know what the next step is because I still
haven't been able to figure out what the fuck people *want* from me, or
the "scene", or techno in general. I'm not entirely sure that the kids
want just really hard techno. The cynic in me assumes that most of those
kids on Friday night were totally fucked up on drugs, and I'm just not
interested in music that only sounds good when I'm high. But the techno
parties at (mostly lame) clubs in SF haven't really been doing it for me
either. I don't dance at raves because the music doesn't make me, and I
can't dance at the Rx because they don't have a fucking license and the
sound sucks to begin with. I honestly think people would get down to the
stuff I hear at little techno events if it were played in a grungy old
warehouse on a big underground soundsystem.

I know, I'm not the typical raver. I don't go to parties to get high; I
go to hear good music in good company. I'm not a typical techno geek
either: I started out DJ'ing DnB and house, so I appreciate the aspects
of "funk" and "jack" that make some electronic music particularly
danceable. The really hard techno lacks sufficient qualities of both,
and as I've said time and time again I think the popularity of that
style has soiled the word "techno" for the rest of us. There's so much
more to it than over-compressed grinding machine sound loops. Maybe I'm
just not "hardcore" enough to give people the impression that I like
"techno"?

I've seen this all happen with industrial/EBM already, as musicality was
slowly edged out by, well, edginess for its own sake. I look back on
when I was a teenager first discovering IDM, and it saddens me because I
fear that the kids going to today's parties won't be exposed to anything
even remotely "progressive" or "interesting". I'm not saying we should
be pushing Aphex Twin on the kids (although I am looking forward to
playing some of the new Analord records on a big 'ol soundsystem), but I
think we owe it to them to give them some variety, some choice.

Exposure under the right circumstances is what made me fall in love with
so much of the music I listen to today, and maybe that's why hard techno
is so popular right now: kids go to a party because their friends are
going to be there, they get high, and they associate that barrage of
distorted kick drums with a good time. I just wish we could supplement
the really hard stuff with something more interesting or imaginative. If
the kids don't demand any variety though, nothing's going to change.

So, fellow partygoers: DEMAND VARIETY. BOYCOTT MONO-STYLISTIC PARTIES.
EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS WITH MUSIC YOU'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE.

That is all,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reviews: DJ Hell, Alien Autopsy, Dirty, and another brief rant

I wish people would stop being so fucking serious about dance music...like, 
for real.

It's made for ... *GASP*  - dancing!!! Not preening and being an elitist 
label whore or genre specific tight-ass.

I for one am actually shocked that the techno & breaks heads got together on 
a party judging by how little most techno-heads tend to like breaks (and 
their apparently more "commercial" sound).  And all this jibber-jabber about 
people taking "chances" and playing different styles in a set...wtf???? I 
have been doing that from day one and really don't see it as a huge leap. I 
mean, if it's all in the same frickin' BPM range or mixable in 1/2 time, how 
hard is it to mix, and how much of a "chance" are you taking (unless you 
have a struck up crowd that only wants one sound all night long)? 99% of EDM 
that has come out since the mid 90's practically mixes itself!!!

I think people just need to pull the poles out of their dances and start 
having fun. Either tha or they need to STFU and get off the damn dancefloors 
so people who wanna get down and have fun can do so unobstructed by the 
party-pooper massive.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] another brief rant

one suggestion:

support mixed genre parties!  support DJs and crews that you know bring a 
diversity of sounds.

or better yet, start throwing parties!  if that scares the shit out of you, 
join an existing crew that is already throwing parties.  start small.  
promote.  invite folks you think would enjoy the sounds you enjoy.  smile 
and laugh and scream and throw your hands in the air when you are at a party 
and the music moves you.

if you want change, make change.  do something.  if you told me one year ago 
that Evil Breaks would be doing what we are doing now...i'd have rolled my 
eyes and shaken my head.  but in one year's time we pushed and pushed and 
pushed and put ourselves on the line and played and played and played and 
promoted and networked and pushed and pushed and pushed until we were on the 
verge of emotional breakdowns and couldnt pay our bills and then we pushed 
some more and we kept playing and playing and playing.  are we perfect?  no. 
  are we fantastic DJs.  no.  are we really any different than anyone on 
this list?  no.  but we wanted more breaks parties and we wanted to hear 
more breaks and we wanted things to be fun and we wanted everyone who came 
to our parties to enjoy themselves.

we still got a lot to work on.  but we're working on it.

Cool I actually know very little about Northern Soul.  Just what is in the 
previously mentioned book are Anoraks basically parkas?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reviews: DJ Hell, Alien Autopsy, Dirty, and another brief rant

Thanks man, I dig it.  Answers.com also noted that anorak can be used as a 
slang word:

anorak (slang)
In British slang, anorak has come to mean "geek" or "nerd", originally from 
the use of anoraks as the invariable wear of train spotters, and then by 
extension to refer to anyone with an unfathomable interest in detailed 
information regarded as boring by the rest of the population - aided by the 
intuition that only a geek would wear something so terminally unfashionable.

The word can be qualified by the area in which the person takes an (implied) 
excessive interest; for example in education, a "timetabling anorak" would 
be someone who found the process of timetabling classes fascinating.

It was reportedly derived from the weatherproof upper clothing worn by 
enthusiasts of offshore radio who would, despite their lack of familiarity 
with maritime life, sometimes travel from British ports in small boats to 
visit the ships from which their outcast heroes broadcast during the 1967-76 
period. The collective impression of their brightly coloured garments in the 
coastal murk of the North Sea was presumably memorable to the crews of those 
"pirate ships" who had restricted contact with the mainland due to the 
Marine Broadcasting Offences Act and the visits might have had an important 
morale-boosting role, although the wearers of the garments might often have 
regretted the discomfort of those sea-tossed journeys. In rough weather 
presumably the anoraks were far more apparent than their distressed wearers 
so those people were identified just by the name of their outer garments. 
The term was reportedly coined by Andy Archer, a disc jockey who gained fame 
in the period following the passing of that Act by the government of Harold 
Wilson. The usage then become generalised to mean obsessive enthusiasts of 
any outdoor activity, and later to cover enthusiasts of other unfashionable 
activities too.

>I for one am actually shocked that the techno & breaks heads got

ummm.  okay.  well, i'm defiantly not one of dem..

>And all this jibber-jabber about people taking "chances" and playing

have been doing that from day one and really don't see it as a huge
leap. I 
mean, if it's all in the same frickin' BPM range or mixable in 1/2 time,
how 
hard is it to mix, and how much of a "chance" are you taking (unless you

have a struck up crowd that only wants one sound all night long)? 99% of
EDM 
that has come out since the mid 90's practically mixes itself!!!<

more than just taking chances with diff styles of music dude.  what i
meant, and *APPARENTLY* should have elaborated on, was doing MORE than
tossin a couple records together one after the other.  programming,
creativity, track selection, tricks, rockin doubles, jugglin the beats
yo, reading the crowd, doing something you have NEVER heard anyone do
before, taking the listeners on a journey - not just *playing* records
for an hour and a half.   

>I think people just need to pull the poles out of their dances and

huh.  yeah...i suppose a pole would defiantly prevent one from having
fun now wouldn't it?  there goes your endorsement deal with
pole-squatters.com  

damn.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Reviews: DJ Hell, Alien Autopsy, Dirty, and another brief rant

Now I would not call myself a good DJ, I would call myself an average jock. 
Compared to most I have heard on this list. But sounds like Sean needed to 
be at the past DEF SF party.. That I had the pleasure of playing at.. I know 
Tooting your own horn is so lame and cheesy, but since I rarely play tekno I 
think it needs to be said since not a super huge crowd attended but still a 
very cool party. But back to my point, First half of my set was straight up 
old skewl 95 acid breaks, Can you say Nation 12, Basco, Meat beat manifesto 
etc.. and take that right into "Drummy Trax techno" which most tekno snobs 
on this list scoff at.. but I have to tell you that almost every person that 
was at that party in the main room was shaking there bootay...

USER rocks... Tekino snobs suck!

My 50 cent y0!!

It's kinda hard to see in this pic - but you get the idea. Once again I say, 
rent Quadrophenia - there are a bazillion of em being worn by the 
Mod/Scooter kids in that movie...

Well the way i look at it is that the unhappy people are always way more 
vocal then the people who had a really good time.  Thats why less then 1% of 
China is really communist because that percent bitched and complained and 
did stuff to change their situation and now they run the biggest country in 
the world and they are the minority by a long shot.

Its easy to listen to people wine and complain, but the fact is that a lot 
of thoose people will do nothing to change their situation.  We have done 
many Techno events over the years and have always  been branded by one 
techno group or another as not "techno" enough for them, and you know what 
we alway struggle but we keep doing it.  Why because we believe in the 
SOOUND.

Funny thing is, is when i was talking to some friends from the UK they were 
totally amazed at how diversified our parties our over here.  They told me 
that they wouldn't even think of  putting two different genres in the same 
room, and that it probably wouldn't work over there.

I think its just irritating thats all, how snobby everybody is.  Does what i 
drive make a difference how much you like my set as well?  i drive a 
Volkswagen... Flame Away.

Genres, when you really get down to it, are marketing tools.  People should 
play the music they love, and turn people on to the music they love.  If a 
DJ concerns themselves too much with just pleasing the audience the DJ is 
losing half the point of what they are doing.  It's dance music, it should 
be helping people transcend their daily lives.  Does it really matter if the 
transcendence comes from House or techno or even <gasp> rock.

Genres are straight jackets.  Better yet, chastity belts.  Free yourselves 
from the restraints and liberate the libido.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his

willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."

Subject: [sfraves] [SRR] - PA System subwoofers for SALE!!!

I have 2 Community XLT415 (4x15") Sub's for sale.

Specs:
http://www.loudspeakers.net/files/specs/new/xlt415.pdf

They were previously owned by an individual who did sound for
clubs/parties/events.  Some of you might know him, his name was Ira. 
Well anyway, when he moved he gave these 2 subs to me, and i really
have no use for them.  They've been sitting in my living room for the
last year, and well I want to get rid of them.  They still work and
are in great condition, aside from a little cat hair on the carpeting
which i can clean off.  There's an extra set of casters that come
along with them.  I'm not looking for a whole lot out of them.  I'd
say probably $750 for each on, or the best offer that comes along, so
feel free to toss any offer into the ring, as i know not a whole lot
of you would be bidding for them i wouldn't think.  but i figure these
speakers helped our scene along the way, may as well keep them within
the same scene.  I havent had too much luck selling them on Ebay or
anything because they're a bitch to ship.  Each one weighs in around
180lbs.  I'm going to be moving in May and i would like to get rid of
these before i have to move because i wont have anywhere to store them
when i get my new place.  Hopefully one of you or perhaps a friend of
yours can give these big boys a nice new home where they will be
appreciated.  For those of you who have been to Ryan and I's house
parties in the last year you may reconize them as those big black
boxes that were sitting in the corner of the living room.  i can
provide actual pictures of the speakers if you'd like and can schedule
just about anytime to come over and inspect them if you'd like as
there is generally one person home all day.  So please please help me
out and help these speakers out.

Email any inquires to me at my other account.  dj_t_ray@yahoo.com

The trip goes on forever
By Pepe Escobar

Hunter Thompson (1937-2005)

"We were angry and righteous in those days, and there were millions of us. 
We kicked two chief executives out of the White House because they were 
stupid warmongers. We conquered Lyndon Johnson and we stomped on Richard 
Nixon - which wise people said was impossible, but so what? It was fun. We 
were warriors then, and our tribe was strong like a river."
- "Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004", Hunter Thompson's last published 
article in Rolling Stone

"Between the idea and the reality ... falls the shadow."
Hunter Thompson's favorite T S Eliot quote

"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs 
began to take hold. I remember saying something like 'I feel a bit 
lightheaded; maybe you should drive ...' And suddenly there was a terrible 
roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all 
swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a 
hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was 
screaming: 'Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?'"

on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be

"Wrong Application expands the palate of noise, minimalism, electronic,
experimental and computer music with pristine, ear-popping soundwaves all
composed under the same rule. All songs were created using only source
material other than soundfiles: TIFFs, text, Photoshop files, emails, raw
code, even another application. Anything was game to farm for audio
material except actual audio."

That can be arranged. I got the 8-bit Construction Set a while ago, and

Subject: [sfraves] srr: Pioneer DJM-707 mixer and mixer suggestions?

anyone have any suggestions for a mixer in the $250-$400 range?

i'd really like to get a new mixer, but can't really afford anything
past $400 (maybe $500).  i've been doing some searches and the price
on the Pioneer DJM-707 has dropped to $299.

tech info here:
http://www.pioneerprodj.com/ (go to products, mixers, DJM 707)

and a review here:
http://remixmag.com/dj_and_performance/remix_pioneer_djm_djm/

what i'm looking for in a mixer:
- solid crossfader so i can pretend to scratch
- solid eqs to twiddle and twist
- good enough sound quality so that we can use it at shows at
small/mid sized venues (like 330 Ritch)
- something that's not going to fall apart on me
- option for effects in/out
- i have a thing against really wide mixers.  19" is just to far for
my tables to be apart

i know.  everyone is going to say "get a rane!!!"

find the info.  ;)

the bass invaderz tour was at sonar in baltimore last night and it was
crazy.  :)

fresh + dieselboy tagteamed like a dream - fresh's style being on a
whimsical tip and dsl coming in hard and dark - yeah!  =D

lots of tunes dropped from fresh's new mad fun concept mix-cd "bass
invaderz."

wicked!

rawk!

have fun!

respectfully,
mary :)

the money is exactly it. when Prohibition was lifted, alcohol prices
dropped. the criminalization of drugs is effectively just a subsidy.

this is really just a conspiracy theory, but I think it really all
comes down to the Mafia. after Prohibition, the Mafia had been
transformed from a ragtag collective of independent operations into a
consolidated federation. the huge nationwide demand for illegal
alcohol made heroes out of smugglers and provided huge motivation for
regional organizations to connect with one another.

but that was nothing compared to Las Vegas. if Prohibition made the
Mafia into a serious nationwide system, owning the economy of the
entire state of Nevada made it into a serious political force. they
started with two senators and went from there. if you ran an illegal
organization which owed its status and power originally to the
criminalization of alcohol, and running that organization had given
you the power to remove Presidents from office whenever they drove
past a grassy knoll, would you be after more power, or less power?
Mafiosos are not known for their humility or wisdom. not the type of
people who'd pass up an opportunity to entrench their organization as
a permanent aspect of the American way of life just because it
happened to be inconvenient for a few hippies and ravers, or for any
particular representatives of the numerous non-Italian ethnicities
living in this country.

then again, it wasn't just the Mafia. it was also the penguins. watch
out for the penguins, man. they don't fuck around.

If you can afford it, a couple powered Mackie tops and a Mackie sub will
do the trick, and sound great. Really easy to work with, too.

Except don't do that. Yes they will do the trick, but that set-up could 
never "sound great".

I could give you the blueprint of what I did. But it's pretty valuable. =D A 
portable system like this for what I paid in total is basically unheard of. 
No Mackie speakers either.

Lemme know...

Oh come on!  Enquiring minds want to know.  Mine specifically, since
so many sound geeks and djs have said otherwise about the Mackies!

As for lists to go to, I've heard some valuable advice on the Amtrak
Djs list.  You can easily do a search for them online but I will see
if I can find some info for you.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] srr: sound system advice?


Honestly, for that application and price range, go used.  You could 
probably get into a used Community system pretty cheap.

The mackies on a stick + sub don't sound all that hot.  Great for playing 
jazz at a coffee shop running at 1/4 their stated capacity... but just not 
solid loud+good in reality.

My system was more for the 100-150 sized crowd.

First i figured out my design limitations

* had to run almost full blast off one circuit (15 amps, but let's say 
12 cause amps pull power funny).

* had to fit in the back of a small pickup truck.

* had to be easy to set up.

* sound quality was worth spending a bit more for

Ended up with:

Rack:
dbx 1066 compressor
rane 22 band stereo eq
rane 2 way crossover
crest audio v450 - top power
crest audio ca9 - bass power
mackie m-1200 amp - monitor power

Cabs:
jbl sr series 2x15" trapezoidal cabinets
jbl mr series 12" 2 way tops
ev 2 way 12" for monitors

That and a good balanced cable set, extension cords, stands, coffin, blah 
blah blah... it just goes on for days.

Sold it all to Cloud Factory after I realized everybody who I thought was 
my friend actually just wanted free/cheap sound.  B, if you want me to go 
with you to shop some stuff, I have no qualms being the guy at the pro 
audio store who asks annoying questions and helps deal shit down.

Also, if anybody is in the market for a larger sound system (~= 5000 watt 
McCauley cab + Crown amp based system), I know a guy who is getting rid of 
one used that is in great shape.  Sounds *great*, amazing system that 
would totally excel at a club installation, but is small enough to drag 
all over the place (bit much for say, a renegade beach party a couple 
hundred yards down the sand... but great for campouts or something like 
Sunset).

Note: the only piece of gear that ever died on me was the Mackie amp.  
Twice.  And actually, even after two factory repairs, one channel was way 
hotter than the other, and it had a tendency to overheat at parties... 
pushing a 100 watt pair of 8 ohm monitors.  I LOVE my 1604 mixer, I swear 
by it... Mackie makes a badass project studio mixer.  But I am yet to be 
impressed by their sound reinforcement gear.  Usually performs way under 
stated specs (weak for wattage, more distortion than they claim, etc) and 
they still seem mostly designed for voice/mellower music playback.  Most 
everybody I know that went with Mackie based sound systems has been 
hurting on repairs, reliabilty, shaky performance at full/near full volume 
and durability.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] srr: sound system advice?

Well, Community Loudspeakers offers free shipping on orders over $4,000. So 
what I did was do an order with an instalation dealer in Oregon, where he 
had them drop ship my part of the order directly to me. Had to go through 
Communitie's Western regional wholesale rep to do it, but we figured it all 
out. I had to go pick it up at Yellow Freight in Sacramento, but it was 
worth it. I got six cabinets, all at wholesale, with no tax and no shipping 
costs.

That's a good way to start. It was a bitch for work, and took over a month 
to get them. But what would have cost me $5,000 in retail cost and sales tax 
cost me $1,800.

There's really good deals on Amps on-line. On my third soudsystem, I've 
become a big fan of Community cabinets and Crest amps. I use this for my 
subs...

http://www.8thstreet.com/product.asp?ProductCode=24155&Category=Power_Amplifiers

But I paid a little less than this for it. However, that is still a very 
good price.

I use two of these...

http://www.poweralley.com/lt1500.htm

one for my dual tower's and one for my single 15" cabinets.

Search around, really good deals out there on these Crest LT series amps 
right now. They rival most Crowns. No joke.

What brings it all together is the DBX Driverack. I've used all kinds of 
crossovers, EQ's, and compressors but this one really does what it's 
supposed to. I'm confident that it's the most important link in the chain. I 
got it from here...

http://www.northernsound.net

They are my secret weapon! No tax, no shipping, and always the lowest price 
on everything. They just don't carry everything.

My system gets serious compliments every week. From new people. And it cost 
me less than buying a comperable set of Mackie Active speakers.

Only thing is, no good for DnB, needs more bass. We use one of the new 
Mackie Fusion subs just for extra kick when we do DnB shows (untill we get 
two more Community subs).

I'm hardly a sound geek though. Wish I was but I'm not. Just did some 
reaserch and got lucky with it. It's seriously mind boggling that we got 
this kind of sound out of this plan, and budget.

You need the "form action" to go to a cgi executable, not a text file:

these are the instructions that were provided to me by my host (this is driving me mad:
 
6. Make sure the ACTION is correct.The trickiest part of the HTML form is getting the ACTION set correctly. Start with the URL of your e-mail template, then split it into two parts, e.g. 
http://web.mit.edu/wwwdev/cgiemail/questions3.txt\                /\                             / `--- Part 1 ---'  ` -------- Part 2 ----------'
First type the URL of your e-mail template into a web browser and make sure it's correct. Then put the script name in the middle. Usually this is ``/cgi-bin/cgiecho'', but it depends on how your server is configured. On web.mit.edu it happens to be ``/bin/cgiecho'', thus my ACTION looks like this: 
http://web.mit.edu/bin/cgiecho/wwwdev/cgiemail/questions3.txt\                /\          /\                             / `--- Part 1 ---'  script name ` -------- Part 2 ----------'
For simplicity, you may leave out part 1, but you must include it if you want to test your form as a local file. If you don't know what that means, just feel free to omit part 1.

Those instructions assume some kind of web server rewriting foo.
Presumably "cgiemail" is the name of a script?

http://www.djpistachio.com/cgi-bin/cgiemail

returns a "403 Forbidden". You need to set up your web server to pemit
this script to execute.

Subject: [sfraves] Free! Pet rats to be your little buddy!!

Hello friends,

I recently bought a female rat from the pet store, and she was
pregnant!  Now I have 11 little ones scurrying around, waiting for the
perfect place in YOUR heart!

Reasons you should have a rat (or 2)
-they don't make noise (or stink, if you change the cage)
-they don't talk back to you
-they can be potty trained
-they are very intelligent, they can come when called, be trained to
do tricks, etc.
-They are very sociable, and male rats will make good 'lap pets', my
female rides contentedly on my shoulder for hours.
-they are little compost machines... they will eat any table scraps
you want to give them
-they live in a cage, which means you can put them away (unlike children)

These rats have been handled almost from birth, are very tame
(suitable for children 6+), and come when they are called (for the
most part).  They are very lively and bouncy, and they have been given
antibiotics through breastmilk for the fist few weeks of their life. 
They love to play, especially the boys.  It's more amusing that TV
watching their antics in the cage!!!

If you are interested in getting a rat (and I recommend a pair, they
can live in the same small space and solitary rats get cold and
lonely), please have a cage with at least 1/2 inch bars (if not
smaller).  The cage is the most expensive thing you will need, or you
can make one.  Or, check CL for listings about free cages (they exist,
I swear).  Other than that, you will want bedding, a food bowl, and a
water bottle, as well as food (duh.)


Please help these CUTE rats live long, happy, fat lives!  Let them
enrich your life as well.

Mail me off list if you're interested!

-Sabra

"This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a
physical one, and it may be both moral and physical,
but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing
without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find
out just what any ! people will quietly submit to and
you have found out the exact measure of injustice and
wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will
continue till they are resisted with either words or
blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are
prescribed by the endurance of those whom they
oppress." ~ Frederick Douglass, 1857

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] Oh... Thursday night was SO Dope: T BDAY &  BASS INVADERS

OK.. the evening started out w/ a really yummy noodle dinner & some drinks
& some NUMMY HAPPYHARDCORE BITHDAY TIM FRUIT COCKTAIL cake.. YUMMY!!! 
LoL.. yeah... I was kinda beat 4 some odd reason so i napped.. when i woke
well... Eryn woke me up whispering my name... hmmm.. that's either really
romantic or hella scary thinkin' about that now... LoL... but other people
there were also Angie, Becca, Eva (ofcourse =), ummm... their 1 hella Cute
friend from Isreal who lives here now I 4got her name, & Henry.. Oh oh
oh.. & Brook & her 2 friends Ben & hella tall Girl showed up also!!  YAY!!
 Then we all walked 2 1015.. some people like took off already... but we
got there... YAY!!

I was already kinda tipsy 'cause I had a drink in honor of Tim & I said I
wasn't gonna get drunk or anything that night 'cause I wanted 2
dance!!!OK.. Literally, as I walked through the door, I was handed a
drink, then shortly after that, another drink, & a drink ticket... later
on in the night, I was handed another beer... ok.. that tosses any pre
planning not getting drunnk plans i have or make.. Hello 2day.. LoL

OK... 1st I gotta talk about people & vibe... 1 of the reasons I've been
so damn fuckin' a happy camper junglist all these yeears is the LOVE... I
mean... I Love my Jungle Family, I Love the vibe that U just can't find
anywhere else, I Love the energy!!  SEriously man... when it's a Jungle
event, I always feel @ home even more so like when i'm @ some kinda family
rave 'cause alota the people I Love are there... so yeah... it was Love 4
who I hung out w/ & even the unsuspcted baby junglists who were kickin' it
there!  WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO  I mean... just where ever I walked or ended
stayin 4 bits @ time... Oooh.. LOVE!  YAY

OK.. now Music... I don't remember who was on the decks 1st.. but he was
sick... MC DUH was on the mic, so I ran up 2 the booth he was @ & shook
his hand.. LoL... then i was dancin' ''cause there was soo much floor
'cause it was still early, 10:30ish, then I heard my name coming from the
speaker & something about chicken salad... LMAO.. Hello 2day.. so fun!! 
Love U Max!

but the 1st DJ was Dope!!  the 2nd DJ was FRESH from the UK (right?)....
he was Sick... Threw down alota Groovy track.. but intoxicating levels of
alcohol were fucking w/ my mentality (lke I knew would happen) that I was
only able 2 grab floor 4 probably 1/2 this set overall then the other 1/2
I socialized & yeah...

I knew when DieselBoy went on 'cause the style of Jungle like mildly
changed 2 something else & I waaaaas Groovin' hard on well.. the side of

anyone go?  I went at 3am and it was off the hook! danced my ass off.  It 
has been sometime since I had been back to the Skye since I had worked 
there, but not having to pay the 35$ cover
x 3 was great!!
;)
people got confused when they went from deep house to techno, that was fun 
to watch!
be well everyone!

I've got (2) extra 2-day passes, a rental SUV and a motel 30 min. away reserved for (3) nights. Rental is free, gas not. Floor-room only for the hotel. We still have (possible) seats for two, contact offline to discuss. I was going to scalp the tix on ebay after it sold out, but I'll hook it up @ cost if I know you.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: RIP Jef Raskin

I had the opportunity to meet this dynamic individual on several
occasions as a child (his son went to school with my sister and I) and
he was everything that might be expected from someone credited with
creating the Macintosh.  He will be missed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WARNING: drinks getting spiked at recent DnB events

Something similar was on the news last week.   Vics vomitting blood and waking up in the ER with
empty pockets, one less sportscar, and a fresh understanding of "Can you watch my drink?"

Didn't someone on-list suspect something like this a few months ago?  He was poo-poo'd for having
too many drinks and losing his keys.  That's usually my excuse when my keys come up missing, but
there are plenty of creepies out there.  Like the thug next door who asked me a few years ago to
get him some GHB at my next rave so he could try out raping a chic.  No shit.

That memory just gave me creepy goosebumps.  

It'd be nice if that dude has been stopped by a runaway uptown bus, or a cement truck going too
fast.  But he's probably doing just fine.  Sadly.  

Yup, shit goes down.   Watch your back & travel in packs.  And be ready to step up to thugs, like
Terrac did that time.  I think that was Terrac, no?  Whipping the shotgun out of his trenchcoat
and doing judo kicks all over that gang of jacket thieves?    I remember clearly because that was
the night I ate that really good acid.

It's kinda cool when ravers throw down on shitheads.  For me, the ecstasy / U.G. mentality isn't
about passivity. It's more like being certain. Like a bizarre breed of soldier with glowsticks &
self-conviction..   


For example--   This one time, some country bumpkin from Walnut Creek showed up at a party and
said, "Is that techno music y'all playin?"

We stomped the shit out of that guy. Cuz we all knew it was glitchy post-Miami bootycore.

Haha.
 
But for real:  Guard your scene. Do good shit. And can you watch my drink?

The trick to avoiding this is of course to have only
two states for your drink: full and empty.  Just down
the thing and you'll have no problems.  Not that I am
encouraging excessive alcohol conspumtion...  

And if you are in doubt, pour it out.  You can always
get another one.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Folded - More Info

Something I have noticed for years now with DJ's and crews and BSPs and 
stuff is the long trail of affiliations that come after a name. 
Sometimes it's really cool because I see a label I like or a crew I am 
down with, sometimes it is a total mystery or even an inside joke 
amongst crew or family. I guess what I appreciate is whenever slightly 
more information can be given like a web URL that encourages checking 
out someone's affiliations in more detail or the rest of a label's 
artists. Also I like little useful blurbs, like if there is a new 
project a bit about the effort and to go check it out. I don't always 
pay attention to house labels or people's projects but I like the music 
enough where if I like a representative sound from that label I might go 
out and browse through what is out there or I might go check someone live.

Anyway, just a note of encouragement to everyone to fill us all in on 
new projects and affiliations and stuff when you can - especially for 
larger events - it is good to see folks active and busy doing the music 
we all love. Party onward.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Folded - More Info

I find after so many years of reading BSPs that I want the information
quick and done, I personally don't like reading a load of hype or a bunch
of extra text so that's how I post my BSPs.  Generally with so many events
going on these days, odds are if I don't recognize the crew, DJ, or
affiliations off the bat I'm not going to pay much attention anyway. 
That's just me though.  Google is your friend too.  Other sites from the
affiliations:

www.oliverecords.com
www.thumpradio.com
www.newstylesound.com

Our night is all hoose music.

Good point, Don.  Here's a bit of background on the ones we posted, and
I think I'll append a little blurb with further info on it to further
posts of ours.

(btw, you may know some or all of this info, just posting so folks that
don't will be filled in)

Turnaround-Sound is a local house label owned by Sen-Sei, noted
keyboardist who is known for playing live with djs and for contributing
keys to a lot of prominent folks' productions as well as his own.  TAS
is on their second release now (a track by Andrew and I called "Friday
Night" with a Chris Lum remix and some remixes by Sen-Sei, and Naz of
In-House fame).  The previous release was a Patrick Turner track with a
really good mix by Jeno and more mixes by Sen-Sei and Naz.  

Sen-Sei is playing with Andrew and I this friday, doing his
live-keys-over-dj-music thing.  He'll be tag-teaming with our pal RFM,
who plays in the local band Loquat- another exceptional keyboardist.

Sf-Vibe is a local promoter group that tends to throw deep/funky house
music events.  They do smaller club stuff (like Taco Tuesdays at Luna
and Cruise Liner at Lingba Lounge) and some larger big-club events. 
Jonas does promotion with them and plays at some of the events.

newstylesound is my little deep tech house label (you knew that :)
which is gearing up to release a new 12" soon, a track of mine
(Origami) called "Everydaylife" with remixes by dj2 and Andrew and I.  

Olive Records is a Chicago-based record label that is co-owned by
french house guys Synthique (aka Max & Brian).  They put out some
big-room banging stuff (like High Caliber) and some jazzier chicago-y
stuff (like Sound Navigators, who Andrew and I did a remix for on
Olive), along with Synthique's frenchy frenchy stuff.  They are cool
cats and all the records of theirs I've heard are great.

Pancake is Grant Dell (UK tech-house dj/producer)'s label (or one of
them).  They recently re-issued dj2 (Delaney Parker and I's duo)'s
first single, "Plural" with a mix by Mazi.  Great music so far on that
label, the previous release being a celebrated cut by Masonic Noodles.

..and you know Thump Radio, but for those that don't, they're a driving
force in the local trance/house/chill community, throwing many club
events large and small, along with their weekly dj mix shows that play
on XM radio as well as select FM stations.  

That be that, I think.  

Cheers mate,

--=====================_11229336==.ALT

Is Your Child a Goth? Presented by St. Mary's Church

Listed below are some warning signs to indicate if your child may have gone 
astray from the Lord. Gothic (or Goth) is a very obscure and often 
dangerous culture that young teenagers are prone to participating in. The 
gothic culture leads young, susceptible minds into an imagined world of 
evil, darkness, and violence. Please seek immediate attention through 
counselling, prayer, and parental guidance to rid your child of Satan's 
temptations if five or more of the following are applicable to your child.

-Frequently wears black clothing.
-Wears band and/or rock t-shirts.
-Wears excessive black eye makeup, lipstick or nail polish.
-Wears any odd silver jewellery or symbols.
-Shows an interest in piercings or tattoos.

-Hunter S. Thompson

"Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look 
on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have 
bought it or baked it or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his 
face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be 
willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even."
-Daniel Berrigan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: more mixer fun! decision made by Ebay.

so last week i posted up a query as to new mixer suggestions, but it
turns out that Ebay made the decision for me.

i was interested in  Pioneer DJM-707 which retails at $299, a drop
from the original price of $699.

so i put in a bid on Ebay and got new one for less than $230.

maybe it won't be the best mixer out there, but for $230 i really
can't complain?  and if i hate it, i can just put it on craigslist for
$250.  ;)

fast enough.  80~

We've got some breaks and house in store for your brain this week.  
Psy-trance authority Michael Liu will be switching hats and dropping a 
special breaks set -- I think.  I heard the next two kids at a house 
party a few weeks ago and had to book them.  Ori and Taj of Earwacks, 
two brothers, can definitely rock a party.  One is older, one is 
younger.  One plays house the other plays breaks.  I'm bringing up my 
scratch mixer to hopefully provoke some sibling rivalry :P

Wow, this response was totally fantastic as I haven't been following 
house so much and wasn't familiar with Turnaround-Sound, needed to be 
reminded of some of the smaller club things, etc.. Very informative, you 
rock! Turnaround is a powerhouse collection of producer/DJs, plus a 
Patrick Turner release! Fucking awesome.
