Subject: [sfraves] JON LEMMON & RICK PRESTON for a buck! <psb>

Hello all,

Hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday weekend! Mine was off the 
hook.. Thanks to Gunnar, Stevian, Podge and Keep Tahoe Deep for having me 
play in Tahoe.. was the first, but certainly won't be the last.. if you 
haven't been to KTD on the last Saturday of the month, you're missing out 
for sure.. Well worth the trip!

Tonight we have a very special Secret Society.. After some developments over 
the weekend, we caught wind of an out of town DJ kickin' it in the South Bay 
tonight, so we asked him if he'd like to come down and play some tunes for 
us.. He graciously accepted and asked if he could have a friend play with 
him.. So tonight, although not our normal 2nd Monday of the month, come down 
to the Savoy for a special treat.. Due to the re-working of the schedule, 
this may be the last Secret Society of 2003.. we're not sure if we'll be 
back next week, or next year.. You should come get your fix tonight! Also, 
for those in the know.. I'll have STICKY! Invitations available tonight.. 
Email me if you haven't heard and/or you want more info! See you tonight..

Jon Lemmon Bio ---

Seattle native Jon Lemmon, through hard work and devotion, has developed his 
musical taste into a necessity in the Northwest house music community. 
Having heard his musical calling at the wee age of five years old, he 
learned to play a wide range of instruments until 1986 when he discovered 
turntables and new horizons unfolded, pointing the way that would become 
Jon's musical path. While his initial tastes laid in post-disco electronic 
sounds he discovered house music two years later, and has yet to look back.
Over the next eight years he made the move to Louisiana and helped foster 
the local scene (and in turn, his creativity) before coming home in 1995 to 
a blossoming Seattle house scene and quickly set up residencies around the 
city and gigs around the world. In 1998 Jon launched Viva Recordings and hit 
the ground running with releases from some of the most respected names in 
the house music community. Jon's breadth of experience and his ear for 
quality music has lent to his success thus far and will only assist him in 
his plan for world domination.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Please consider non signing gay marriage petition

for the sake of separation of church and state, i urge everyone to not sign this petition, but instead create a new petition that
removes the word "mariage" from all existing U.S. laws.  existing civil libery laws governing custody and adoption of minors should
be re-written.  laws exist already allowing the assignment of medical power of attorney to others.

fix the existing laws, don't make more broken ones.

-=dave

ps- and get that sh*t out of our taxes !  *arggg*

Today is World Aids Day.  As with Patrick (whose remembrance appears 
below), my life has forever been changed by this disease.  So many dancers, 
good friends, and lovers taken by Aids.  And it continues....

A WORLD AIDS DAY REMEMBRANCE

Patrick Letellier, AlterNet
AIDS has taken some of the people I loved most in the world; people I loved 
fiercely, passionately, and entirely.

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm




"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the 'Universe,' a part 
limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and 
feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion 
of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting 
us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. 
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles 
of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in 
its beauty."
-Albert Einstein

If you're not going to Sticky on the 13th, check this out!  Should be
fun..  For information on the Sticky Christmas cocktail party, hit me
up!  

--------------------------------------

Retro Diva, thegraymasquerade and Smoove present -

*Saturday, December 13th, 2003 9p - 2a. 
Rawhide 280 7th St. @ Folsom, 21+ w/ID 
http://www.litebrite.org/club
 

As winter approaches, the days get shorter, the temperature gets 
colder, the nights get longer, and we've got just the thing to rock 
your 
jingle bells and make it hotter!

Come and celebrate the holidays with us at Club Lite Brite. We'll have 
music pumping the heat back into you veins downstairs courtesy of 
Resident DJ *Smoove* "the red nose"  (*space cowboys*) with his 
merry cohort dj's "Dasher" *The Geometrist*  (*space cowboys*) and 
"Dancer" *Laird* (*golden gate recordings*).  Saturina "Ms. Freeze" 
will 
be putting the chill on upstairs and together they'll guide you on a 
journey through our Northern Lites!

If you're still feeling a bit on the icy side, then maybe our Naughty 
Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus can warm you up. (Hey, what goes on in the 
North Pole, stays in the North Pole!)

After all that, if you're still feeling frigid, then warm up to the 
flames with a tasty drink as we bring you a Fire Performance by our 
sexy 
elves *Sintillation/Fire Pixie (Fire show begins @ 11:30pm.)* 

Dress in your favourite holiday attire and get in for only $10. If your

Santa suit and bells are out to the cleaners entrance fee is only $12.
 
Not enough fuzzies in your closet ? No problem,  get your holiday 
shopping done while you shake your booty.  We've got cute and cuddly 
fashions from the Cloud Factory Design Collective for your buying 
pleasure.
 
Great music, flaming elves, a blizzard of not-stop music, what else 
could we possibly give you? How about your favourite childhood toy. 
Yes, 
folks, the mighty super-sized Lite Brite will be on hand for you to 
show 
off your best yuletide creations.

So don't be shy, come on down to the Rawhide on December 13th and play 
with us. We promise not to run your grandma over with a reindeer.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Mars' Vinyl & Dubplates from Sonic Sunrise on ebay...The Next Generation - 2 days left [nrr]

Hey Everyone!

I have a collection of Mars' Dubplates from his new CD Sonic Sunrise and
some out of print tracks also available on ebay now.  There are 2 days left
in the auctions so if you're interested in the vinyl listed, then you better
get crackin'..hehe..

The Dubplates are of course unreleased material and available on the sonic
sunrise cd.  The vinyl releases of the Mars' dubs won't be available for
several years so this is a once in a year-or-so time to get a hold of them
while they're available now.  If you guys have any questions about the
plates or vinyl, let me know privately.  :o)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR physical sciences: matrix and thermodynamics



An excerpt from "The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2003:"
"Experimenters at the Australian National University in Canberra and Griffith 
Univ. in Brisbane established that, over a short time period, nano-machines 
can violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.  They came to this conclusion in a 
paper published in the July 29 issue of Physical Review Letters.  The 2nd law 
says that, for an enclosed system, disorder increases; for example, it is 
impossible to use the heat energy in a glass of water-- that is, the energy of the 
molecules of water jiggling around-- to run a machine and leave behind a 
cooler glass of water, or perhaps just ice.  That would clearly violate the 2nd 
law.  The 2nd law is admittedly regarded as a statistical law, which applies with 
perfect accuracy only when vast numbers of atoms are involved (objects on a 
human scale involve trillions of particles).  The Australian experiment 
involved the movement of a tiny bead (micron-sized, or about 1/4000 inch wide) 
through water.  A laser was used to position the bead--in effect, pulling the bead.  
But even though the bead was tiny, millions of atoms were still involved.  In 
the experiment, friction-- the 2nd law in effect-- would usually resist the 
movement of the bead, but sometimes (although not for more than 2 seconds at a 
time) the water would push the bead in the direction it was being pulled, in 
effect extracting heat extracting heat from the water to do work, in apparent 
violation of the second law.  Scientists voiced surprise at the result.  
Researchers said it meant the new field of nano-technology might have to take into 
account unusual phenomena that could make nano-machines run backwards for brief 
periods. Denis Evans, one of the researchers, indicated there also might be 
implications for biology, since many life processes involve systems on similar 
size scales as those in the experiment.

***************************
The Future of Drug Testing
***************************
Wired Magazine reports on a new drug-detection patch under development
by SpectRx. "For the monitor to work, employees first have to have four
microscopic holes -- about the size of a human hair -- burnt into the
outer layer of their skin by a handheld laser... The oval patch houses a
miniature vacuum pump that sucks out interstitial fluid, a clear,
water-like fluid that surrounds cells in the body.") When a drug is
detected, a miniature transmitter sends out an alert signal.

That's pretty intense.  I study Cellular Bio and I wasn't even aware of the 
presence of some substances that get stored in the extracellular matrix.  I 
can't imagine subjecting myself to being "lasered" unless it was a job that 
I really-really wanted.  I think that technology is going to be pretty 
expensive for McDonald's to try to implicate on its applicants.  I wouldn't 
really worry about it all that much.

It's the skills party on Valentine's Day.  I made this post as a joke because 
they spelled electro 3 different ways on 1 flyer.  "Eletro Techno Disco 
Popsikle" I think is the genre. :P

i want to hear some Electro too ... but to me, "Electro" as part of Skills' 
"Elektro-Tekno-Disko" theme doesn't refer to Electro music; it's part of a 
playful, tongue-in-cheek reference to electronic dance music in general. It 
doesn't mean they feature actual Electro, Techno, or Disco, although I wouldn't be 
surprised to hear Enemy or one of the others throw down some techno tracks. I 
sure as hell don't want to hear any actual "Disco"; had more than enough in my 
early days of clubbing (yes, I actually remember when clubs would close with 
Donna Summer's "Last Dance" -- gawd what a cliche!). 

It's like when Eminem says "nobody listens to techno." I really seriously 
doubt he means real Detroit-style Techno. He's speaking generically and means, 
"THAT SHIT MUSIC THAT MOBY MAKES" since we know he hates Moby. He means "people 
listen to rap, not that 'techno' shit." 

Anyhow ... at any Skills party you can expect to hear a lot of Trance, some 
NRG, and usually some Jungle. As big parties go, their parties are excellent; 
much better and more honest than a Coolworld party. 
I'm going to go to it, for sure. I don't think I've missed a single Skills 
party! Good memories ... anybody remember "Tronic & The Magic Bubbles" and 
"Trancegiving" in 1999. Fun times.

Those 2 parties were the final days of the good Skills parties. Back when
Radley still did the flyers and when the REAL Tronic was still the main
character. Back when it was 2nd and Jackson for a venue or Maritime and
things were a tad more entertaining. Times have changed.

I'll also be at Tantra NYE.  Had an excellent time last year, and we can 
ride the "party on the train" Muni to within a few blocks of SOMARTS:)

Subject: [sfraves] I wonder...

I wonder how many email addresses I could take from here and just randomly add 
people to friendster, and have the person already be registered with that email 
address.  Granted, a lot of people probably have a separate email just for this 
list, like I do, so the numbers may not be so high.

My email address for friendster is atawmicpm@hotmail.com if anyone wants to add 
me.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR -=-  Soda Machines in schools.

What is everyone's opinion on soda machines all through out public schools, as 
well as fast food being served in schools?

I think that it leads to more and more laziness, and a more obese society.  I 
don't think anyone was deprived before when school had a water fountain and 
somewhat healthy food, if you didn't bring your own.

No wonder we're the most obese nation, feeding our kids straight sugar and 
straight fat for lunch everyday. :)

se/30, 2mb of ram, i just gotta say ...

this won't work in our time -- there are too many people who believe in 
the sanctity of marraige, regardless of whether or not they are able to 
keep the committment.

nice idea, i've thought of the same thing in the past, but just decided 
that this isn't that important to me.  also, if i ever did have kids, 
having the option of the same name is an age-old comfort.

as far as gay marriage, i really don't care.  i never plan on being in 
one.  kind of heartless, i guess, but on the same token, i'm not 
against it either.  i just think this issue is too trivial for me to 
care about it one way or another.

well,

now you don't know that!

maybe it could work sometime somewhere.  (redefining marraige without 
the word marriage)

but then again, you're talking to someone that is always right, or more

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR -=-  Soda Machines in schools.

I'm long past school and don't really plan on having kids anytime in the
near future, but I think the addition of fast food is better than the
crap they served in school when I went.  I mean, healthy?  Not even
remotely.  We had some fast food added to my high school my junior year
and they had a pizza hut with good salads for the same price as mystery
meat and lumpy milk.  Fast food may not be the best thing, but the kids
will eat it over the lunchroom crap and maybe someone will get a good
salad bar in there too at some point.

What is everyone's opinion on soda machines all through out public
schools, as 
well as fast food being served in schools?

I think that it leads to more and more laziness, and a more obese
society.  I 
don't think anyone was deprived before when school had a water fountain
and 
somewhat healthy food, if you didn't bring your own.

No wonder we're the most obese nation, feeding our kids straight sugar
and 
straight fat for lunch everyday. :)

I'm planning to go to Fun! Fun! and know a lot of people who are going. The 
VibeRite crew are a nice bunch of people and i have confidence that it'll be a 
good-energy party. 

I'll be giving out copies of DJ Eluzion's new CD, "3 Days & 3 Nights," so hit 
me up at the party if you want to check out some trance (with label and cover 
designed by yours truly).

stating my beliefs.

 

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/02/science/02ECST.html?8hpib

 

New York Times | 2 Dec 2003

 

Research on Ecstasy Is Clouded by Errors

 

   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 

   In September, the journal Science issued a startling retraction.

 

   A primate study it published in 2002, with heavy publicity, warned

   that the amount of the drug Ecstasy that a typical user consumes in a

   single night might cause permanent brain damage.

 

   It turned out that the $1.3 million study, led by Dr. George A.

   Ricaurte of Johns Hopkins University, had not used Ecstasy at all.
His

   10 squirrel monkeys and baboons had instead been injected with

   overdoses of methamphetamine, and two of them had died. The labels on

   two vials he bought in 2000, he said, were somehow switched.

 

   The problem corrupted four other studies in his lab, forcing him to

   withdraw four other papers.

 

   It was not the first time Dr. Ricaurte's lab was accused of using

   flawed studies to suggest that recreational drugs are highly

   dangerous. In previous years he was accused of publicizing doubtful

   results without checking them, and was criticized for research that

   contributed to a government campaign suggesting that Ecstasy made

   "holes in the brain."

 

   [...]

 

   Pictures from the study PET -- scans of the brains of Ecstasy users
--

   were

   used on a famous postcard from the drug agency, "Plain Brain/Brain

   After Ecstasy." The postcards were distributed to thousands of

   teenagers and implied that Ecstasy users had shrunken brains with

   holes in them.

 

   The study had nothing to do with holes, but with serotonin levels,

   which Dr. Ricaurte found drastically depleted in 14 subjects who had

   taken Ecstasy 70 to 400 times.

 

   Dr. Marc Laruelle, a Columbia University PET scan specialist, called

   the work so technically flawed that it was "something to put under
the

   rug." He cited a recent German study showing that serotonin decreased

   only modestly and returned to normal within six weeks. The Hopkins

   team, he said, presented its data in logarithmically compressed
graphs

   that seemed calculated to mask the fact that it had found impossible

   results: its 15 "control" subjects had serotonin levels 50 times

   normal.

 

   Dr. Ricaurte defended the study, saying his recalculation technique

   was common when results from two groups varied widely, although he

   said he no longer used it.

 

   Of the photos, Dr. Ricaurte said he had no control over what the

   national drug institute did with his work, but he had asked an agency

   official to fix their "poor quality."

More like 9 (tops for a standing row concert venue or other "standing"
type situation), but you usually run into fire exit and other limiting
factors first.  For dining or table seating, you'll find that it's way
more space per person than that (which I assume you'll be seeing a lot of
in your lounge).

Imagine the most crowded undergrounds you've been to, and that's around 4
square feet per person (too crowded to dance really, that's just a 2x2'
square - I've actually been to rock/punk shows where people started
falling over and causing little domino effects at that density... not safe
for sure).

Regarding exits, there's some math they do, assuming people are 3'x3', you
can get one person at a time out a door every two seconds, and for fire
codes you have to be able to empty your capacity within two minutes so
every standard door is good for 60 people of capacity.  Other factors like
sprinkler system, overall fire rating (100% concrete is less flammable
than a movie theater with fabric all over the place), detection equipment
present and ceiling height (taller ceiling means more time to get out
before flashpoint and CO oxygen displacement occurs) also come into play.

Of course, your results may differ.  I've been working parties where two
people have given me way different numbers on capacity... even fire /
safety personnel that are familiar with the space.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Ruby Skye is looking for a Stage/sound/video/lighting supervisor

To any of you interested in this position, Ross is a great guy!  I have 
worked with these guys for years from backbeat to Ruby Sky, but they are 
definately a "no Bullshit" group of people, especially when it comes to the 
GM named Reggie (who is RAD if you work your ASS OFF!) until 4am.
You will be reimbursed well too, I do know that...just thought I would give 
ya a lil background.
And tell them Picard says wussup!!!

Subject: [sfraves] music industry keeps going after the little guys

summary:  ASCAP can sue venue owners if bands playing at the venue play a 
cover of a copywritten song.

full story is here:

URL: 
sfgate.com/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/03/BUGL13CH5H26.DTL

what's next?  karaoke bars or...gasp....DJs that play other people's music!?

<clip>
In the past few years, Skip's also became home to a small but burgeoning 
music scene, even as live music declined in the rest of the city. Bands with 
names like the Lab Rats and Thunder Blue staged marathon jam sessions that 
attracted crowds that often spilled onto the sidewalk.

But the stage at Skip's has been silent since Oct. 1, when owner Bill 
Courtright pulled the plug after deciding that offering live music wasn't 
worth the legal trouble it was attracting.

Twice in less than a year, Courtright was sued for copyright infringement by 
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which collects 
royalty payments for copyright holders and represents them in legal 
disputes.

"I wasn't going to wait for a third lawsuit," said Courtright, who has owned 
Skip's since 1990.

As record companies conduct a much-publicized effort to crack down on 
Internet music downloads, Courtright's bitter legal dispute shows how small- 
club owners, simply by providing a venue to local musicians, can run afoul 
of the guardians of copyrighted music.

Courtright's troubles began in September 2002, when he received a letter 
claiming that a private investigator hired by ASCAP heard musicians playing 
covers of copyrighted songs at Skip's on June 22, 2002.

The letter, from the San Francisco office of the law firm Heller Ehrman 
White & McAuliffe, threatened a lawsuit.

Under copyright law, Courtright can be held liable for the copyright 
infringements at his club because he never purchased a license from ASCAP.

You have GOT to be kidding me. I knew there's a reason I no longer wanted to

how admissable is a private investigaor's word that somebody played a copyrighted song?   unless it's being recorded, how's there any proof?

1973-2003: Ripley has moved from Arlington (MA) to Oberlin (OH), to
Central Square Cambridge (MA), to Hackney, London (UK), to Brooklyn

thinking it's a brain, re-breaking bass and beats from jungle into dub,
dancehall, hiphop, bhangra breaks and experimental noise. On sunny
days, Ripley spins rocksteady. In the world of letters, Ripley also
examines global property systems, through the lens of legal and
economic history, especially investigating how people come to think
they can own music as if it was a thing and not a practice. Ripley
wants everyone to dance.

Subject: [sfraves] FYI: BART is FREE on Thursday, December 4 (tomorrow) from 4am to 9am

Free Morning Commute on BART: On December 4th, BART will be free from 4
a.m. until 9 a.m. This is an opportunity to reward regular BART
commuters with a free ride and draw new commuters onto BART. Customers
will be able to enter BART faregates at no cost and with no BART ticket
required (although a ticket will be needed for return trips later that
day.) Daily parking fees at the Westbay and Lake Merritt stations will
also be free that day. A recent study reveals that the average Bay Area
commuter waste 42 hours a year sitting in traffic and by taking BART to
work commuters can save $20-40 a day in automobile costs. A person who
commutes on BART instead of driving can avoid 5 tons of auto pollution.
Further BART riders achieve the equivalent of 250 miles per gallon on
BART =96 about 10 times the fuel economy of a typical car. Questions can
be directed to the BART Marketing Department at (510) 464-7161. The
free morning commute on BART is courtesy of ING Director, an on-line
savings bank and the sponsor of this promotion.=

The guy is fighting a license fee of $59 a month, or about $2 a night.

ASCAP licensing has been in place for a while (I'm sure google will give
more details than you'd ever want to know). Technically, any business that
plays music that is published by an ASCAP member artist has to have an
ASCAP license. This includes cafes, bars (the jukebox probably has an
ASCAP license sticker), and yes, live performance venues.

This system is arguably a good thing, because it allows anybody to play
other people's music as long as they pay the license fee, without having
to negotiate with the author of each copyrighted work directly.

Yea, but going after a bar-owner because some band played a COVER SONG, is 
fucking retarded. I understand why they do that for places that use 
jukeboxes or radio stations, but that's just taking it to the extreme....

I'm sure that if the industry hires private investigators, the PIs are bonded 
or have some way of certifying that they're telling the truth. If they keep a 
written log of the songs, that's probably evidence enough that the song was 
played. I know that radio DJs have to keep a log of what they play so that 
ASCAP or BMI can be paid.

Almost all songs are copyrighted. Almost any cover song is subject tp 
payments to either ASCAP or BMI. If you're playing something that's in the public 
domain, that's up for grabs. For example, if you play Mozart, his heirs don't 
collect money from performances of his work, and there is no payment to ASCAP or 
BMI. You can play music by long-dead blues musicians and even copyright a new 
version with your name on it. (In the late 60s Led Zeppelin got away with 
using old blues songs and claiming them as their own, earning royalties, rather 
than just saying the songs were "traditional.")

The rule was something like this: the artistic creation (song) is protected 
by copyright law until 50 years after it's created. I believe it was changed to 
50 years after the death of the creator, which extended the protection. So, 
all those 800 albums a year by the supposedly dead Tupac ... 50 years after his 
death, his music will be in the public domain so they better sell what they 
can, now. 
This might not be 100% right as there have been changes to copyright law, but 
I hope this sheds a little light on the subject.

Criminalization Doesn't Curb Booze, Drug Use
Wednesday, December 03, 2003
By Radley Balko

The great journalist H.L. Mencken was a fierce critic of alcohol=20
prohibition. He wrote in 1925:

"Five years of Prohibition have had, at least, this one benign=20
effect:=A0they have completely disposed of all the favorite arguments of=20=

he Prohibitionists. None of the great boons and usufructs that were to=20=

follow the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment has come to pass. There=20=

is not less drunkenness in the Republic, but more. There is not less=20
crime, but more. There is not less insanity, but more. The cost of=20
government is not smaller, but vastly greater. Respect for law has not=20=

increased, but diminished."

Mencken was right, which is why Prohibition was repealed in 1933, 70=20
years ago tomorrow.=A0

No amount of legislation could curb America's taste for booze. What=20
Prohibition did do=A0was create a lucrative black market for booze=A0and=20=

invite the ancillary crime -- organized and otherwise -- that comes=20
with it.=A0The corruption of the bootlegging industry infected every=20
level of law enforcement. Local cops and prosecutors, members of=20
Congress (which had its own private stock of liquor) --even President=20
William Harding's Attorney General -- were buyable, bribable, and to=20
coin a word, imbibable.

Forcing Americans to go underground to satiate their thirst for alcohol=20=

also brought with it a major public health problem.=A0Americans drank=20
harder, because they had to get their fix in one sitting, and didn't=20
know where or when they'd get their next drink. And they drank more=20
potent stuff -- bathtub gin and other home-brewed spirits, liquor that=20=

was unchecked by market forces or regulators, and so was not only vile=20=

and potent, but could at times be downright poisonous. By the mid=20
1920s, hospitalizations and deaths from alcohol poisoning soared. Some=20=

say we have Prohibition to thank for the success of the cocktail, as=20
the only available alcohol was virtually undrinkable straight-up.=A0

What's unfortunate is that our lawmakers still haven't learned the=20
lessons of Prohibition.=A0

For the last 40 years, for example, we've engaged in a Prohibition of a=20=

different kind -- drug prohibition. The similarities are striking.

Despite harsher sentences, increased funding for law enforcement, more=20=

prisons, expensive public relations campaigns and frightening=20
trespasses on our civil liberties, Americans still generally use=20
illicit drugs with the same frequency they have since the drug war=20
began, according to the=A0National Survey on Drug Use and Health.=A0

Different drugs come in and out of vogue, but the percentage of the=20
populace using them=A0=A0has largely remained the same for 30 years.=A0The=
=20
only difference is, as we make access to those drugs more and more=20
difficult, the drugs become more expensive, making the drug trade more=20=

and more lucrative, meaning pushers will go to greater lengths and take=20=

greater risks because users will pay more money to get them.

The drug war has made war zones of some urban areas in much the same=20
way Prohibition famously turned sections of Chicago into public=20
shooting galleries. We've made millionaires of cocaine and heroin=20
cartels in the same way temperance=A0made wealthy men of=A0Al Capone and=20=

George Remus. And we've made hardened criminals of small-time dope=20
dealers the way alcohol Prohibition made felons of bartenders and=20
distillers. The number of people behind bars in the United States for=20
drug crimes alone now exceeds the number of people in prison in Europe=20=

for all crimes combined.

Now, increasingly, states and municipalities are going after tobacco,=20
too, believing that higher taxes and bans on public smoking will=20
persuade longtime smokers to quit. In New York City, which has long=20
imposed a cigarette tax that is among the highest in the nation, a=20
thriving black market for tobacco has emerged, serving as a copious=20
source of funding for organized crime and smugglers, as well=20
as=A0international terrorist organizations like=A0Hezbollah=A0and=A0al-Qae=
da.

The states of California, Delaware and New York now forbid smoking in=20
public places. In the late 1990s, Canada experimented with an=20
aggressive hike on cigarette taxes. The tax resulted in such an=20
overwhelming wave of black market crime that lawmakers repealed the tax=20=

two years later. The United Kingdom has the highest cigarette taxes in=20=

Europe. Consequently, the UK has become a hub for international=20
cigarette smuggling, the beneficiaries of which include such nefarious=20=

elements as the Irish Republican Army and the Italian mafia, among=20
others.

American lawmakers haven't even=A0learned the lessons of Prohibition =
when=20
it comes to alcohol. In the last 10 years, a well-funded group of=20
neo-prohibitionist advocacy groups have sprung up and have begun=20
calling for a variety of public policy initiatives aimed squarely at=20
restricting (again) the public's access to alcohol. Groups such as=20
the=A0Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Center for Alcohol=20=

Marketing to Youth, and the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse=20
advocate such=A0initiatives=A0as raising taxes on alcohol, forbidding=20
alcohol manufacturers from advertising, using zoning laws to limit=20
the=A0number of bars and liquor stores in a particular neighborhood, and=20=

making it more difficult for restaurants and pubs to obtain liquor=20
licenses.

The hard lesson we should have--but have not--learned from=A0our various=20=

"prohibitions" is that no amount of legislation or social=20

population=A0from=A0using substances many of the rest of us disapprove =
of.=A0=20
=A0 =A0

Perhaps our lawmakers will soon learn that we can't simply legislate=20
away the supply or the demand for Americans' more piacular appetites,=20
no matter how distasteful we may find them. Certainly, there are people=20=

who abuse controlled substances. But the better course of action=A0would=20=

be=A0to deal with the individual.=A0Sweeping, expensive, far-reaching =

I agree, but I think the logic is that if you have some unknown band playing 
their own songs, nobody would go, and they wouldn't sell any drinks. So, by 
allowing covers to be played, the bar makes more money and therefore needs to 
give a little chunk to the licensers of the songs. 
ASCAP and BMI are desperate for money because music sales are down, so 
they're trying to squeeze it wherever they can.

ASCAP is not the RIAA, and it's a good thing that songwriters can make a
bit of money when their song gets played at a commercial venue by someone
else.

Chances are it wasn't ONE band playing ONE cover, but rather the venue
featuring cover bands or jazz combos that rely heavily on standards
for material without ponying up to the ASCAP venue fees.

This is a for profit establishment charging people to get in but not

ASCAP is a pretty decent organization and has protected the rights of the
original authors of works many times in cases against major record labels.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] music industry keeps going after the little guys

On that note I wonder what the actual artist gets paid after all the
ASCAP employees get their cut and then after the record label execs take
their cut. I would really like to know this. Can anyone enlighten me
because I have no idea? It does not seem like it would amount to much.
Peace

-------------------------------1070500250
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Found this on the Internet, from earlier in the year: 

"Something is missing at Diablo Day Camp in Lafayette, Calif., this year. ... 
 Starting this summer, the American Society of Composers, Authors & 
Publishers has informed camps nationwide that they must pay license fees to use any of 
the four million copyrighted songs written or published by Ascap's 68,000 
members. Those who sing or play but don't pay, Ascap warns, may be violating the 
law. 
 Like restaurants, hotels, bars, stores and clubs, which already pay fees to 
use copyrighted music, camps -- including non-profit ones such as those run by 
the Girl Scouts -- are being told to ante up. The demand covers not only 
recorded music but also songs around the campfire.  ...  No more "Edelweiss" free 
of charge. No more "This Land Is Your Land." An Ascap spokesman says "Kumbaya" 
isn't on its list, but "God Bless America" is. 
 Diablo, an all-volunteer day camp that charges girls $44 a week to cover 
expenses, would owe Ascap $591 this year, based on the camp's size and how long 
it runs.  ... . 
 "At first I thought, 'You guys have got to be kidding,"' says Sharon Kosch, 
the council's director of program services. "They can't sing the songs? But 
it's pretty threatening. We were told the penalty can be $5,000 and six days in 
jail." 
 So, the camp's directors have scrutinized its official "Elf Manual" and, in 
the section headed "Favorite Songs at Diablo Day Camp," have crossed out the 
most popular copyrighted tunes with black Magic Marker. ...
 "We wanted to sing 'Underwear,' but it's set to the tune of 'Battle Hymn of 
the Republic,"' says Mrs. King, the co-director. "We're not sure if that's 
copyrighted; so, we don't sing it." 
 "When in doubt, don't sing," advises Site Director Leslie Shanders. 
 Even harder than figuring out which songs are which, directors say, is 
explaining it all to young Brownies. "They think copyright means the 'mean people,' 
" says Debby Cwalina, a 14-year-old Elf. Mr. Holly explains it to them this 
way: "The people who wrote it have a thing on it. A little 'c' with circles 
around it. There's an alarm on it. And if you sing it, BOOM!" 
 That explanation doesn't always sink in. Alissa Fiset, age 8, crinkles her 
nose when asked why she can't sing "Puff the Magic Dragon." While squirting a 
friend with a water bottle, she says: "They did a rewrite on it. A copy thing. 
But why can't they just take the 'c' away?" 
...
 The federal copyright act allows composers and music publishers to demand 
royalty payments for any public performance of copyrighted material. The law 
defines a public performance as "where a substantial number of persons outside of 
a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered." 
Although the law has been on the books since 1909, Ascap began notifying large music 
users, such as hotels, only a little over a decade ago and more recently has 
worked its way down to small users, such as rodeos and funeral homes. This 
year, it negotiated a reduced annual fee of $257 with camps enrolled in the 
American Camping Association. For camps, such as Diablo, that aren't association 
members, the fees are higher, ranging from $308 to $1,439 a year. Small camps 
that last two weeks or less get a special rate of $77. 
 Penalties for noncompliance can be stiff. The law sets fines up to $25,000 
or a year in prison, or both, for major infringements. Ascap, which sends 
monitors around the country, has successfully sued restaurants, retailers and 
private clubs...
 Ascap contends that its members have contributed heavily to the Scouts over 
the years. In 1940, Irving Berlin donated all future royalties from his "God 
Bless America" to the New York City Boy Scout and Girl Scout councils. Although 
the Scouts still get royalties from it, Mr. Lo Frumento concedes that, 
nevertheless, they can't sing it without paying the fee. 
 So, it's back to black Magic Markers. 
 After finishing the Macarena at the Diablo sing-along, one mother whispers 
that today is the sixth birthday of David Warneke, a camp volunteer's son. 
"We're not allowed to sing 'Happy Birthday,' " warns Debi Jansen, a co-director. 
 Huddling with the Elves, the directors come up with a plan: Sing a modified 
"Happy Birthday" to the tune of "Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall." 
 But Mrs. Jansen is worried. "I hope that's not copyrighted, too," she frets. 
" [end quote]

Regarding Happy Birthday, Michael Jackson owned the copyright but I wouldn't 
be surprised if he sold it to pay his legal bills or food for his captive 
animals.

Subject: [sfraves] [srr] [bsp] chistmas babies, bands, dj's, whoever else... listen up!

so... since some friends will actually be in town on
my birthday (christmas eve) and i'll actually be able
to have a party with friends on the actual day of my
birthday, i've decided to go all out.

i've contacted several hotels which have adjoining
clubs in an attempt to be able to book bands/dj's for
the 24th (possibly 24th-26th) in addition to being
able to reserve a group of adjoining rooms (possibly
an entire floor depending on the amount of "christmas
babies" and their friends/family).

i'd basically be promoting the shows in the local
media as a "christmas babies" bday party and then
letting the bday people know about the room deals.

so yeah, anyway... short ass notice and i still don't
know if i'll be able to get any hotel/club to agree
but if your bday is coming up and you're game, let me
know.  if you're a dj or in a band and don't have
plans for the 24th (possibly 24th-26th) let me know.

get back to me privately as i'm going to unsub once
this posts.

--

if you happen to have any hotel/club hookups or know
of a good hotel/club to have this at, please let me
know.

--

and to all you damn email harvesters.  if i end up on
any of your damn lists i'm going to freak.  every time
i post here i end up on several dozen lists.

not enough gluttony from the turkeyfest?  liver asking for more
abuse?  sick of the seizure-inducing wal-mart trampling
shopping frenzy?

well, fcuk - come on out to this week's installment of
thirstybear thirsdays!

we've pleased to have *andrew phelan* back for some funky
housey goodness, along with me, mr. sticky and my dirty daddy
bear, drop, spinning some sexy saxy downtempo.

we're going from 6pm till 10pm, so you'll be able to get your
drunk on, get your mack on, and stumble over to whatever you
plan next for the night.

come out early and sing "happy-crappy birthday" to steve0, aka
drop.  he's getting older, dirtier, and has a lot more
young'uns around to call him "daddy"...  ;)

:: :: ::

happy hour at thirstybear thirsdays

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Cronos and Les Carter on An Epiphany of Sound right now

Hi folks,
Plenty of San Francisco house in store today for An Epiphany of Sound.
We're bringing in Les Carter and Cronos today, starting with Les Carter.
Sure to bring you plenty of ass shakin house!  Do tune in!!  90.1 FM in
the bay area, or online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Also, for you San Frandisco folks, don't forget to vote in next
Tuesday's election!  Both Mayor and D.A. offices are critical to our
scene.  (I myself endorse Gonzalez and Hallinan.  Gonzalez got an A+
rating from the Sierra Club, while Newsom got a D after all.)  You can
also submit an absentee ballot ahead of time at city hall (just take the
elevator down a floor and it's right there.)  That way you won't
possibly forget or run out of time on Tues.

Peace!

read the article again - he's offered to buy the license several times. 
what he's fighting for is for ASCAP to drop the lawsuit.

Did you post the rest of that other passage?  I accidentally deleted everything

   Hmm, perhaps in my love for Poe I was a bit callous in that
mssg....I completely ignored the horrible nature of the news
story.  
   My regrets go out to the family that has to live Poe's
terrible story, and the young man that felt the effects....

hey, all,  :)
we have a big rehearsal space (soundproofed room) and art/storage space available, also we have a 'writer/artist room' for rent, and 2 rooms for rent to live/work.  the rehearsal space is $15/hr, $25 for 2 hrs.. the rooms for rent range from $225-$400.
it's a big unfinished space, eventually it will be an art/music/performance coffee house kinda space.  but for now it's our big dirty hovel with potential.  it used to be mission records, now it's in transition.
as for the roommate part, we're looking for people who will invest time/work/$  into the place, in trade for big cool digs.
we need lots of donated stuff, too, house furnishings, electrical work, lighting, AV stuff (vhs projector, pa system), paint, furniture, etc..

we need lots of donated stuff, too, house furnishings, electrical work, lighting, AV stuff (vhs projector, pa system), paint, furniture, etc..
sooooooooo..... email me if interested, or if you'd like to get involved somehow.  we need lots of help, but this place will be dope when it's done.  :)

thanks!!

wow. what a place. We had a great opening night with a cast of people =
whose enthusiasm I cannot begin to insult by trying to recreate with =
words. wow. Les Carter, DJ Cronos, Jack Triumph, Kevin James ripped it =
up in a dual level atmosphere with huge dancing space, a great bar and =
private cabana's for those who just needed a break to chill from the =
onslaught that blasted San Jose last night. My only regret is for those =
who were across the street at the Agenda. Sorry, couldn't save all you =
guys ;) - Respect due to Cronos who master minded this little venture =
and has put, to say the least, some time into it.

Stay tuned, it goes down again next Thursday.

Thanks for the kind words Jack.  I had a blast last night, especially with
the crowd.  Looking around the club didn't make me feel like I was in San
Jose at all.  It was the complete SF atmosphere, with the lighting, decor,
and energy that was in the room.

Thanks to everyone from sfraves who came out last night to support the
grand opening.  It goes on next week, so stay tuned for more info.

hello, this is your on-line ravers advent calender with the continuing surprise window for the day...watch the holiday unfold..."so, after capturing as many chia pets as possible and putting them in the trunk for gifts at the party, the boys and girls resumed their journey to the party where every type of electronica would be played in the largest venue this side of the world and that side of the country. it helps that they had all invested just one dollar into the combined lottery ticket that won, so that none of them would ever have to worry about money again, and with really nice girls in the car with them, if things didn't work out with the girls who weren't there, everything would still be okay...."...more later...:)

Subject: [sfraves] nrr.... so my school & my work update tingie...

I been getting alot emails about how the "new" job is working out... & sorry I haven't gotten back 2 y'all about it, so I figure I'd just tell y'all here... but It's actually not going great... I mean... the main basis of my job is going out everyday 4 like mmmm 8 hours & "scouting"... but see... I don't have enough money to do that esp on Public transportation esp when I gotta do the school thing twice a week... but I do scout people when I go out which probably isn't good enough, but la la la...so yeah... that's what's been going on w/ that... but if your interested in modeling, or a dj interested in spinnning in clubs throughout the US, or an actor/actress who wants needs help getting started... hit me up & I can get you in contact w/ my executives...

As for school... lastnight was my last night of my 1st session/ 1st class (Gen300)... YAY!!  I mean like... it wouldn't normally take this long 2 finish this 1st class @ University Of Phoenix since classes are 5 weeks for undergrads... but when I 1st went to UOP late Aug/early sept, rememebr I had 2 drop out 4 med reasons?  So like next week... I start my 2nd class...& it's all exciting...

OK... well... that's all that I'm up 2... OK... have a Groovy & Safe weekend y'all... hopefully I'll c some of U Groovers!  Oh yeah... my friend's throwing a lil underground 2night if U y'all wanna check it out...

I had a blast last night. Everyone killed it on the decks, the club itself was off the hook and everyone that came out was really cool. What more could you ask for? Thanks again for having me out Patrick, it was awsome.

Warren... First of all STOP CROSSPOSTING TO SFRAVES.   They don't give a shit about your petty drama.
 
Second of all, don't take everyting you read so damn personally...  you see you posted your message immediately after Dinas.  Not only that, but you quoted her email verbatim.  Coincidence?  I think not.  When you do something stupid like that expect to have it commented on, and for the record i'm not the only person who commented on it...  
 
And lastly... 
 
STOP CROSSPOSTING TO SFRAVES

Newsbrief: DEA Tries RAVE Act Intimidation Again, But Activists 
Successfully Fight Back 12/5/03

Oregon NORML held its Oregon Medical Cannabis Awards banquet November 15 at 
the Lloyd Center DoubleTree Hotel, but not before successfully fending off 
an effort by the DEA to scare the hotel into canceling the event. As was 
the case earlier this year in Montana 
(<http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/290/dearave.shtml>http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/290/dearave.shtml), 
the DEA attempted to use the RAVE Act to shut down an event it didn't like. 
Under provisions of the RAVE Act, the owners or operators of venues where 
drugs are present could be subject to severe civil and criminal sanctions.

According to the Portland alternative paper the Willamette Week, two days 
before the event, Ken Magee of the Oregon DEA office sent a letter to the 
hotel noting Oregon NORML's planned event and raising the specter of a RAVE 
Act prosecution. Did the hotel intend to "knowingly permit... the illegal 
possession, conspiracy to possess or to aid and abet the possession of 
marijuana"? asked Magee.

Good corporate citizen that it is, the DoubleTree promptly canceled the 
event. But Oregon NORML was having none of that. Instead, the group teamed 
up with the Oregon ACLU, Graham Boyd of the national ACLU's Drug Policy 
Litigation Project, and Portland attorney Michael Harting to send letters 
to the hotel and the DEA threatening legal action for breach of contract 
and violation of the First Amendment.

A compromise ensued. Oregon NORML ditched its "Beautiful Bud Award" and the 
hotel relented. Afterwords, Magee told the Week that he wasn't trying to 
block the event, only ensure that no drugs were used there. But this is the 
second time the DEA has blatantly attempted to suppress drug reform events 
with RAVE Act threats. Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE), who got the act passed by 
sneaking it into another, more popular bill, has said this is not what he 
intended the RAVE Act to do. Maybe someone should let the senator know 
what's going on.

Have you ever tried responding to an email, only to have your response 
bounce back because the sender's account is configured only to send 
messages, not receive them? Some newsletters and lists work like that. 
Perhaps you are only subscribed to email services where you can respond 
to the sender(s). If so, great!

How to Tell a Democrat from a Republican During the Holiday Season
by John Carlson And you thought you could tell Republicans from Democrats 
by how they
vote. Not so! Just observe how they act during the holidays:
Republican say "Merry Christmas!"
Democrats say "Happy Holidays!"
Republicans help the poor during the holidays by sending $50 to the
Salvation Army.
Democrats help the poor by giving $50, one buck at a time, to panhandlers
on the street.
Democrats get back at Republicans on their Christmas list by giving them
fruitcakes.
Republicans re-wrap them and send them to in-laws.
Democrats let their kids open all the gifts on Christmas Eve.
Republicans make their kids wait until Christmas morning
When toasting the Holidays, Republicans ask for sherry or mulled wine.
Democrats ask for egg nog.
When not in stores, Republicans use a catalog.
Democrats watch for "incredible tv offers" on late night television.
Democrats do a lot of their shopping at Cost-Co and WalMart.
So do Republicans, but they don't admit it.
Democrats give their children gifts that make a political statement.
Republicans give their children gifts that will keep them out of their
hair.
Republican parents have no problem buying their kids toy guns.
Democrats refuse to do so. That is why their kids pretend to shoot each
other with dolls.
Republicans spend hundreds of dollars and hour of work decorating the
yard with outdoor lights and Christmas displays.
Democrats save their time and money and drive around at night to enjoy
the scenery.
Democrats favorite Christmas movie is "Miracle on 34th Street."
Republicans favorite Christmas movie is "It's a Wonderful Life."
Right-Wing Republicans favorite Christmas movie is "Diehard".
Republicans always take the price tag off any expensive gifts they buy
before wrapping.
Democrats also remove price tags off pricey gifts ... and reposition them
them to make sure they are seen.
Republicans wear wide red ties and green sport jackets during the festive
season.
Democrats do too, all year round.
Most Republicans try, at least once, enclosing indulgent, wretchedly
maudlin form letters about their families in their Christmas Cards.
Public ridicule from Democrats usually discourages them from doing it
again.
Democrats favorite Christmas song is "Deck the Halls".
Young Democrats favorite Christmas song is "Grandma Got Run Over by a
Reindeer."
Republicans favorite Christmas song is " White Christmas."
Young Republicans favorite Christmas song is "White Christmas".
Cheapskate Republicans buy an artificial Christmas tree.
Tightfisted Democrats buy a real tree, but they wait until the week
before Christmas when the lots lower their prices.
Democratic men like to watch football while their wives, girlfriends or
mothers fix holiday meals.
On this, Republicans are in full agreement.
Republicans see nothing wrong with letting their children play "Cowboys
and Indians".
Democrats don't either, as long as the Indians get to win.
Republicans first began thinking like Republicans when they stopped
believing in Santa Claus...
Democrats became Democrats because they never stopped believing in Santa
Claus...

Subject: [sfraves] (BSP) SPEAK OUT_Sunday Dec. 7th_Feat. "Uncovered" documentary

--0-1143392750-1070751524=:8036
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


On Sunday, December 7th, we are showing a screening of the new documentary Uncovered: The Whole Truth about the Iraq War. The documentary clearly describes, in the words of experts and former intelligence officials, how President Bush and his administration manipulated evidence to take our country to war.  
There are over 2,000 parties across the nation taking place simultaneously for this event and will be brought together through a huge cross-country conference call. At 5:30 PM, party attendees will be able to dial in to a call featuring director Robert Greenwald, the MoveOn team, and guests from parties all over the country. You'll also be able to submit questions for Mr. Greenwald and the team online. 
Here's a little more about Uncovered: 
MoveOn.org doesn't usually sponsor documentary films, but this movie is a really important one. It's built around interviews with over 20 intelligence and military experts, many of whom are speaking out for the first time. True to the MoveOn ethic, director Robert Greenwald lets the facts speak for themselves. And the results are pretty shocking. 
Uncovered combines expert interviews with extensive research to go behind the walls of government. Interviewees include: 

   Joe Wilson, the former Ambassador to Iraq who exposed that the famous "16 words" in Bush's State of the Union address about uranium in Niger were false. In retaliation, senior White House officials appear to have blown the cover of Wilson's wife, an undercover CIA agent. 


   John Dean, White House lawyer for President Nixon during the Watergate scandal. 


   Rand Beers, former Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for combating terrorism. 


   David Albright, a physicist, nuclear weapons expert, and former weapons inspector with the IAEA Action team. 


   Rt. Hon. Clare Short, the British Member of Parliament who recently resigned her position as Tony Blair's secretary for international development because Blair did not support a UN coalition to rebuild Iraq. 

It's a powerful film and we hope you will come to learn the truth.

The schedule will be as follows:

Sunday, December 7th from 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM

4:00 PM Screening of the documentary (approx. 1 hour in length)

5:30 PM Nationwide conference call

Following the call we will have DJs T-Ray (breaks/house), Cyzmik (progressive house/trance), and Roy E (trance) playing until 10:00 PM. 

There will be no cover, $2 beers and $3 wells until 6:00 PM, free video games and lots of free parking.

hello, this is your on-line ravers calender...perhaps this is not moving you, but it is not all about the feelings, now, is it?...."after several hours of road travel, someone, of course, had to stop for a whiz, so stop they did, and secretly, the girls congregated and talked about how much they had a big ole crush on you-know-who, and how good you-know-who is at you-know what, and it all went exactly as planned..."...more later...:)

Hey -- my TV show premieres tonight in San Francisco on Channel 29 at 
8PM -- it's called citiZine and it's an alternative look at what life 
could here in San Francisco -- if you've got cable and live in the city 
-- this is the perfect show to watch before you head out for the night. 
And if you don't have cable, or even if you do, we'd love to have you 
at our premiere party where we'll be watching our show as it airs. 
Space is kinda limited -- so if you'd like to come -- give me a call at 
(805)895-9220 and I'll give you directions.

Josh

Once again -- the show's called citiZine -- 8pm Channel 29 in the city 
of SF

NOTE: You can place an absentee ballot at City Hall tomorrow between
10am and 4pm (enter city hall and take the elevator down one floor.)  I
can't remember if you can vote absentee on Monday or not.  Anyone know?

Newsom is definitely no democrat.  He even made a campaign contribution
to Bush in 2000.  There's an article in The Nation about Democrats
supporting Gonzalez (http://www.mattgonzalez.com/article.php?id=269)
(only 3% of SF voters are registered as Greens.)  This course of action
is totally in line with my feelings towards the democratic party after
they've rallied around someone like Newsom (who was given a D by the
Sierra Club, vs. Gonzalez's A+.)  And Gonzalez used to be a Democrat
before switching to the Green party in 2000.  The New York Times had a
bit to say about it all in today's paper:
http://www.mattgonzalez.com/article.php?id=270  It's a good read.

Also, there's an event tomorrow night that Heidi posted about a little
while ago: Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War at the
Sublounge, and it's also being shown at the UNCOVERED Film Screening and
Party for Matt at the Punch Gallery (doors at 6 and film at 7.)

And remember to make sure you help a couple of friends make it to the
polls too!

Found this on someone's web log.  Don't know the origin:


Breaks lovers like to be known as the elite dancers
Drum-N-Bass lovers wanna be known as the hardcore mofo's
Disco lovers just wanna be sexy
House lovers don't wanna be known as ravers
Trance lovers appreciate the unity the music can create.
Psy Goa lovers are the spiritual hippies in the scene
Techno lovers are the old schoolers who never really grew up.


Love,

Apollo

What about the hardcore and hard house/NRG kids?  I think they are the ones 
that know they are ravers, but are in stubborn denial.  He he (pronounced:

Subject: [sfraves] Fun Fun Review

LoL... it was a trip lastnight... Hello 2day... so unexpected, but so fun fun....

OK... so the night started out when JBlaze & I talk on the phone & like well we made plans 2 go out & he told me about this party happening & I was like ok... ok...

So we call the voice mail (3-Way) & listen 2 the "instructions" lol... ok... Jblaze remarked during the vm that the party didn't sound 2 "fun fun" w/ all those specific instructions... LoL...

So anywaze... we go & it was fun fun! I had a fun fun time actually!!  LOLOLOLOMAO... I mean... there was an Awesome vibe of people there & lol.. it was kinda fuinny 'cause every new person I met there.. i mean...seriously... almost all of them I met.. they were like, "Oh... you're name's Osby... Oh shit.. I heard so much about U".... & like I dunno... that kinda freaked me out...

But no... there was an Awesome vibe... people were really nice... lol.. it was fun... Oh shit... I finally saw fuckin Larry aka ChinaOnNitrous (old skool sfr if some of y'all remember) & that was so Dope!!  LoL.. him & I spent the night basically play fighting & pretending we hated each other but we talked soo much & totally caught up & man... it was Dope!  Love that kid so much! Oh yeah... there were alota people there who I ain't seen in months.. that was fuckin' dope!! man.. so fun!  (Hi Christie Ruiz if your still on here =)

OK.. the music was sick!!  Good shit man... ok.. alota surprises... when JBlaze & I got there... welll checked out the rooms & when we finally got up 2 the last room... it was Psy-trance spinning & I dunno... I went up hella close 2 the DJ booth 2 c who was spinning & it looked like this lil' 13 year kid who was on the decks playing & I was like WOW.. then the Dude looked up @ me... it was Michael Lui!!  LoL... how fun fun!!  LoL... so yeah... his set was Awesome!!  I Loved it!!

OK... but what really trip me out was when Jmarr went on after him... OK... soooo confusing but so pleasing... he was like doin' cross fader tricks w/ his record & Michael Lui's record & it was breakbeats... @ 1st I thouhgt, ok, well... he's gonna sin trance & probably is jus usin' the breakdown in the song, la la la... ok.. but I was trippin... he played a whole fuckin' set of BREAKBEATS!!! OK.... YUMMY!!!  I Loved it man... he even got like 80 Nostalgic & played the RockBerry track from like early 80's & Shake it by Salt N Pepa & even oh gosh.. I loved it... then he played alota Acid Breaks, but not like the Acid breaks that Konkers spins... but his tracks had alota acids licks in them.. Oh Gosh man.. I Loved it... alot Future breaks in his set... Good shit man... 

I mean.. all the DJs were Awesome lastnight!!  Oh gosh man... Tronic was there playin this totally fun fun Hardcore set!!  OK.. if i remember correctly... there was this hardcore track he soun w/ Gun N Roses like sampled... but it was totally fun fun man... but then mean etard girl was there well... the small blond etard meaie was there... she's never nice 2 me...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Fun Fun Review

Hey, what's up Osby?
    I actually saw you last night, but I didn't have the chance to say hi 
(my bad).  Anyway, last night was pretty damn Fun-Fun.  Unfortunately, the 
venue (commonly called "Jared's", The Dojo, The Dungeon, or Hell) was hotter 
than fcvk but it looked really nice.  I was actually at a party there the 
night before as well and I liked the Viberite decorations a lot more.  They 
are a really cool crew and I had a blast last night... So, the sign had a 
ton of bright red cherries on it and said, "No matter how many you eat, 
you'll never get your cherry back!"  HA HA HA.  It was amazing.  J-Marr 
played Push-It and the crowd went nuts.  Who thought that they'd ever hear 
Salt and Peppa at a rave.  Great sets from Tronic and Carlos Alfonzo as 
well.  I saw JonnyR, and it was good.  There were more crackies there than 
usual, and there were a lot of people who smelled like a combination of B.O. 
and Vaporub (how depressing), but I still had a really good time.  Big ups 
to Viberite for bringing good sound, good vibes, and an overall great party.
Peace.Love.Unity.and.Noise....
Joey Frisco

Subject: [sfraves] 12/25 CHRIST ON CRUTCHES!!! (a co-op party)

hey there y'all:

i live in a berkeley co-op with some nice speakers and
a pretty good space for dancing.  i'd like to put
together a small shindig for the night of xmas (thurs
12/25).  we're talking like 50-100 people, 9 - 1
pounding techno music; 1 -> late chiller stuff. 
(berkeley has a fairly strict noise ordinance and i
just can't afford to get slapped with a
fine...however, most of our neighbors are frat boys
and they'll be hibernating for winter, so i can assume
that somewhat loud music won't be a problem...)

so, is anyone interested in participating?  we have to
keep this small and intimate, but i'd like to extend
the invitation to the community, especially if there
are any djs/musicians out there who'd like to perform
and any
jews/atheists/buddhists/hindus/muslims/nonxmascelebrating
christians etc etc etc out there who have absolutely
nothing to do on xmas and wanna hear some phat beats.

i'd like to make this a completely co-operative and
free event, so i would love as many helping hands as
possible.  please get back to me if you're interested.

thanks!

*emma*

Subject: [sfraves] Today NRR

I was at this crazy little warehouse.. I guess it's the 'SPAZ' space?
Really low-key. Not raveish at all, although I saw some people poiing (is
that a word?) to the weird trippy music.

Those cats are pretty amazing. They're doing some pretty exciting things.

Anyway. I have a very unsettling sight to report:

I'm sitting there, pretty zony, when I see this little tiny kid tottering
around holding a record. I'm like -huh! The kid likes records! that's
cool.

So he walks up to the decks. waves at them with the record. His mom gets a
milk create or something and he climbs up on top.

Fits the record into place. Lays down the needle. Switches the fader over.

What the fuck.

"How old is he?"
"Year and a half."
...then:
"Yeah, he can't beatmatch for shit, but he's getting there."

I fear the skills this kid will have in 15 years. :b

Subject: [sfraves] Endangered Species...Get Freaky

--=====================_7980044==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I rarely go to club or any other dance events these days with security 
measures that violate my person;  that is, pat downs and searches of 
personal items.  Anything beyond an ID check and I walk away.  So my 
partying recently has been limited to undergrounds and club venues, like 
Club 6 and  Barneveld,  where patrons are treated with respect and not like 
potential criminals.

I was delighted, therefore, when I heard that the latest edition of "Get 
Freaky" was to be held at 550 Barneveld.  Haven't been there since Thump 
moved to the DNA.  Love the venue, but the recent parties there have been 
commercial or mediocre.  "Get Freaky" was neither.  Rather, it was a 
rebirthing of those energetic, creative, innovative and magical nights I 
experienced in the seminal days of the rave/club scene in San Francisco in 
the early nineties.

Brandon has characterized "Get Freaky" as Thump with breaks.   Indeed, "Get 
Freaky" has the same respectful, loving vibe as the early Thump 
parties.  And there is the same ecstatic, sweaty, sexually infused dance 
floor peopled with folks who love the music and dance with both the body 
and soul.  But "Get Freaky" is darker, harder and more cutting-edge than 
Thump.

Many of the psytrance people seemed to have migrated to this party, but 
with an attitude and dress that is more modern primitive and tribal than 
dayglo.  Costumed dancers were the rule here.  There were a large number of 
people who appeared to have raided the props department of "Road Warrior" 
whilst adding some touches from Burning Man encampments.  Half-naked dudes 
with bondage gear.  One guy who appeared to have mud smeared over his upper 
torso.  All very stimulating.  Earthy.  Tribal.  Hot.  The moisture dripped 
from the ceiling onto the dance floor in the main room reflecting back the 
steamy body work of the dancers on the floor.  Outside in the smoking area 
there were fire dancers supported by drummers and keyboards.  I really love 
this kind of party.  This is what San Francisco was and is becoming 
again:  a maelstrom of sensually-infused spirit.

San Francisco.  We arrived in the middle of Lorin's set and, towards the 
end he stopped the music and made an announcement.  Lorin quoted a recent 
statement by Jeb Bush during a Cabinet meeting last month.  While pointing 
to a environmental map showing various wildlife, Bush said:  "It looks like 
the people of San Francisco are an endangered species, which may not be a 
bad thing.  That's probably good news for the country."  Well, Jeb, SF is 
still wild and free and will continue to be so.  "Get Freaky" was packed 
with Matt Gonzalez supporters, myself included.  I haven't worked so hard 
on a political campaign in years.  The endangered species in SF were the 
artists, musicians, crafts people and "freaks."  Well, we are coming back 
and reclaiming our little city state and to hell with you.

I have often said that positive, paradigm breaking cultural and artistic 
change arises in discordant, challenging times.  We are on the cusp of 
change, especially in the dance and rave communities.  The music I danced 
to at "Get Freaky" was a clear indication of a movement I have been feeling 
in my feet and yearning for in my heart for many moons.  Adam Freeland's 
set was astonishing.  Breaks?  Well, sure there were breakbeats but dancing 
to his set I experienced a concretization of my belief that house, breaks 
and hip-hop are converging, whilst sampling some of the great dance music 
from the past, to create something new and wonderful.  KraftyKuts did both 
a hip hop set in the side room, and then went on to throw down 
"experimental" breaks in the main room infused with dub, reggae and hip hop 
beats as well as trance-like interludes that broke into wild, 
psytrance-like beats.

"Get Freaky" was an epiphany for me.  It confirmed my belief that our 
revolutionary community of ravers and dancers is far from dead.  Rather, we 
are moving into a new age of musical and social innovation and I'm happy 
and lucky to be a part of it all....once again.  As Jacques Attali 
wrote:  "Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead 
of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually 
become visible."  This new world is about to envelope us.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Another reason I love this area....

So, at least once a week on my way to work, between the BART and my office 
building, there's a guy playing jazz/blues guitar on the sidewalk next to a 
little coffee shop hut thingy. Now, this isn't anything extraordinary on 
it's own, but this isn't your typical panhandling street musician. This guy 
is fucking GOOD at what he does, and he's not panhandling! He's just playing 
to play. What makes it even more special (to me anyway) is the fact that on 
the days he's there, about a block before you see him, you will hear these 
random, sweet notes floating through the air lazily, almost like a feather 
caught in a gentle breeze. The closer you get the more sweet the tune, and 
no matter how shitty a mood I'm in, at least while I can hear him, all that 
negative energy is gone. As I walk past him towards my building, the notes 
seem to follow, and one by one drift off like a cloud sticking to the wing 
of a plane as you fly through it...slowly dissipating until you've gotten 
further along down the line.

Anyway...it always puts me in a good mood, so I thought I'd share. (and I'm 
trying to keep my spirits up cuz I'ma be one lonely SOB this Xmas)

Anyhoo...what's going on this weekend party-wise??? Anyone, Bueller??

How'd do y'all feel about your kid's interaction with music?  I personally 
want to do the headphone's to my future pregnant wife's belly thing, unless 
I find out that is damaging of course.  And I want him to pursue any music 
he is interested in, and get him lessons(yes, it WILL be a him).

I need an enlightening topic of dicussion on this gloomy morning(although,

Subject: [sfraves] BE.ES.PEE !! Sticky II !! 12.13.03 :: SF :: $10 :: FREE spirits (drinky kind) :: 9 - 4am+

I'm sure a lot of your remember the last Sticky party from 420 this past
April. If you were there then you also know what to expect in terms of food,
drink., and most important music and friends! This Saturday, December 13th
we once again bring you Sticky!

The holiday madness is upon us and it's time to get everyone under one roof
for a family reunion. We've prepared a solid lineup the SF Bay's finest
house, breaks, and downtempo for your listening enjoyment. The key to any
Sticky event is the space. Remember how amazing that last spot was?? Well
we've got another NEW space that really is NEW! No, really... it's badass
space that hasn't been used for a party until now. The space is a large,
cozy 2 room loft with ample outdoor space complete with a garden in back and
fire pit! How many spots in SF do you know like that? I sure as hell haven't
seen the like. The fire pit will surely add to the charm and warmth that
surrounds this holiday season.

Like the last Sticky, all drinks and food are complimentary. Translated...
free open bar with free food to match. Drink up, eat lots and be funky like
always! Food and drink wise we'll have a lot just like the last time. I
don't think anyone was hungry or complained about lack of "spirits"

This party is being powered by Evite and we would *GREATLY* appreciate you
letting us know via Evite if you intend to come. The link is below. You can
use PayPal too!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re: Today NRR your baby's future

Classical is always a good base music to train any child.  It
encompasses all forms of instrumentation, (strings, percussion, brass,
composition, harmony and melody etc) and also many a study has shown
that it improves intelligence or at least the intelligence quotient and
concentration.  (IMO, any music without words leads to higher
concentration on a task in front of you, I've been listening to a lot of
Wagner and Beethoven lately while reading on the train and I seem to be
retaining more from the books I'm reading than normal.)  And in
conjunction with sonograms, the babies will know the low end of the
spectrum as well which is the bass we all love (that's is just my guess
of course) ;)

As for parents listening flavor and growing up.. My dad listened to 50's
bubblegum, and my mom liked classic rock.  I hated both styles growing
up but now..  I sometimes gotta listen to some Buddy Holly or Everly
Brothers (not to mention it helped me fall immediately in love with the
Avalanches) and you can take my classic rock when you pry it from my
cold dead hand.  I still haven't found a better music for road trips on
a sunny day.  :)

1) Uh, I dunno.

2) The bay area is famous for great underground hiphop. Some of the bigger
names that have come out of the area: Tech Nine (N9ne? something like
that), Andre Nickatina, and Del the Funky Homosapien (Hieroglyphics).

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Bill of Rights Day - December 15

(Forwarded message from Lance Brown)

Hi folks,

I've put together a central site to help people organize their  
celebration
of Bill of Rights Day. This year is sort of the "beta" version, but  
there
are still tons of ideas and resources there -- and I will be adding more
steadily all week.

http://billofrightsday.com
  The domain name is just now starting to work -- if it doesn't work for  
you
then try again in a few minutes, or a few hours.

One special feature is a step-by-step guide to putting together a  
Funeral
for the Bill of Rights. There's still time for you to do one this year  
and
I *highly* recommend it. There is a sample press release, poster,  
handout,
and instructions for the rest, here:

http://billofrightsday.com/archives/ 
cat_funeral_for_the_bill_of_rights_guid
e.html

There's a place to list your event, there are sample resolutions,  
letters,
and op-eds, and lots more. Come grab an idea or a template and rock the
holiday. And pass this on right away, so other late starters can take
advantage of the booster shot!

http://billofrightsday.com
"Bill of Rights Day is December 15th. What are you going to do about  
it?"

Be Well, Be Free,

	There's also Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and Consolidated -- not 
totally hip hop, particularly the latter band, but very good stuff.

Darn, I was looking forward to a little Dungeons and Dragons Hiphop

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ** vote gonzalez**

I wish I could vote in SF.  Especially since I spend more time here than
I do at my home.  Like most of the voters who are going to be the wild
cards in this, I for the first time in my life actually want to vote
because I feel for the first time actually changes can be made.  If
you're in SF and aren't going to vote, please cast a vote for Gonzales
pour moi :)

I was chatting on the net today with this nice young lady and she told me she 
lived in a small town and loved techno music and also she wanted to buy 
turntables & all the cool neat DJ crap that us DJ's have. 

I told her my points on how to get started and what not but maybe we can all 
help her out...

Kanye West and Mase are 2 dif. peoples. Mase retired from rappin and is now a 
preacher who found god. kanye west is one of the inhouse producers for 
Roc-A-Fella records (along with just blaze, whose making some slammin raved out 
115bpm party  tracks at the moment; check "fire" by joe buddens or rah digga 
"party and bullshit 2003"). he did "izzo" and "bonny and clyde 2003" for jay z and 
did a verse on jay z's "the bounce" on the blueprint 2. recently he;s been 
doin his own stuff as far as rappin and producing and the results is "thru the 
wire" coming out on his forthcoming lp "college drop-out".

he;ll put out old mateiral for years to come like biggie and pac...while hes 
alive.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Tips Please On How TO Get Started DJ'N *not for me*

I will give my two cents as I just bought some Technics in August.  If she 
is passionate about tables, then I highly recommend getting Technics, she 
will never have to replace them.  If she just wants to try it out, she could 
go for those DJ in a box deals, but I still would go against that.  If you 
ask anyone on this board, or ask anyone who is passionate about tables, they 
will suggest Technics all the way.  Some good forums to gain information 
are:

djforums.com
www.futureproducers.com (go to the DJ section)

If she does a few searches in those forums, she will come up with all the 
information she needs.  DJ forums has some really good tutorials and even 
has a comparison of Technics to other tables, I think.

When I first got my tables, I started with two identical progressive house 
records, moved on to two identical drum and bass records, and now Im having 
a blast mixing hiphop and dnb...next investment will be final scratch.

Peace

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Tips Please On How TO Get Started DJ'N *not for me*

I'd suggest working your ass off to get your beat matching on point before 
you try to learn any tricks.  Beat matching is the most fundamental and 
important thing when mixing.  It doesn't matter how many tricks you can do, 
or how on point you can cut if your beats sound like sneakers in the dryer.  
After that, I'd work on phrasing and cutting.   Then programming a set, I 
guess.  If you can figure out all of those things, you're in a better place 
then half of the people who pretend to be dj's.  Oh, and once you've learned 
to beat match fairly consistantly, learn to pitch-bend (adjusting the pitch 
live without touching the platter).  This makes your live performance sound 
a lot cleaner (I'm still working on my pitch bending, touching the platter 
is a hard habit to break, if I had to start over again I'd learn to only 
pitch bend).  Once you've mastered the fundamentals, you can learn new ways 
to mix, fade, cut, drop, and scratch; but I'd wait until I had the other 
stuff down before I worked on the advanced stuff.
Cheers and goodluck,
Joey

I recently discovered "Balder's Gate: Dark Alliance" for the x-box (also
on the playstation 2).

Man, that game is fun.  Very true to DnD, but with incredible graphics
and audio.  

I mean, I got so tired of using my imagination with real DnD... :)

Seriously, though, Dark Alliance is the bomb, yo.

Add a sentence or two when you have time.  Sense this is a rave list I would
like the story to be about raves; music, parties, finding the place,
whatever.  I would also like to publish it when it is done, so if you could
not go over an "R" rating I would appreciate it.
This is my first time trying this, so if you have any comments let me know.

 -Andrew RB

The story: 
As usual we had to drive for two hours looking for the place.
   "Map point my ass!"
   My buddy from the back sit said sarcastically "Oh man! I'm sure glad we
got those tickets in advance."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tips Please On How TO Get Started DJ'N *not for me*

Dear nice young lady who wants to learn to spin,
I learned to spin when i was 15.  I live in New York City and I used to live in 
the Bay Area as well.  If you're not already on the list, join NYCRaves.  Then 
you'll be able to chat with more East Coast deejays and find out about events, 
etc.  They're easy to find on the web.  Let me know if you have problems 
joining.

Just like the other guys said, get good at mixing before learing all the tricks 
and scratching and stuff...  There are videos and books out there that you can 
buy now, but nothing beats practice!  Practice does NOT make perfect!  Perfect 
practice makes perfect! 

Good luck :)

In the front seat, Steve0 sat next to me in silence, feverishly
sucking on his blowpop.  He'd never rolled before, and had
taken his "e" an hour ago with the intention of a smooth
entrance past security.

Abruptly, Steve0 stopped his slurping.  "Oh you guys!  You know
that I don't care what we end up doing tonight!  I'm just so
happy that we get to spend time with each other.  You're my
bestest friends!  I love you..."

I tried to casually scoot away from Steve0, but was limited by
my ability to be able to drive properly.  He promptly filled
the gap between us and started stroking my leg.

This, however, was the least of my worries. The drugs had taken hold.

"Take the wheel you filthy beast!" I howled as the asphalt -- solid, mere
moments ago -- twisted and churned beneath the wheels of my  mom's
minivan, black lava lapping against the doors in slowly mounting waves.
Soon, they would crash overhead and that crap would be into the air ducts.
We were not equipped to breathe asphalt.

Steve0's saucerlike eyes rolled in terror as his focus shifted from wang
to wheel, darting back and forth in panic. "I don't want to die man!" he
whined.

"WE WILL IF THAT GODDAMN ASPHALT GETS INTO THE AIR DUCTS!" I bellowed,
thrashing in my seat. I gave him a rough shove aside, reaffirming my role
as captain of this ship. Never send an etard to do a man's job.

Horns blared somewhere, far in the distance - lights strobed across my
field of vision. A sharp jerk to the left seemed to calm things down,
silencing the screams of my charges.

"Will you kids stop--"

"There!" Jessie, from the back seat, jabbed a finger past my face, the
motion sending distorted ripples through the already thickening air.
Another sharp tug on the wheel, and I applied the emergency break to calm
the angry roar of the engine.

"Someone take the wheel. I'm going to shake this joker down for
information," I mumbled, clawing at my seatbelt and launching myself out
the driver's-side window. The door was rigged. I knew it.

Brush some gravel from the old skivvies (they'll love my tie-dye
longjohns, I mused) and a sharp tug to the ole beanie as I get to my feet.
Give him the look. There, in the shadows, a terrified-looking kid in pants
big enough to fit two dogs and a moderately endowed chinese girl. I put on
my most reassuring smile, and began my sauntering approach.

dude, this is hardly smut.

don't tell me you've never rolled/been with someone who has for
the first time?  gimme a break.  at the very least, you've seen
"groove" right?

people get all touchy-feely while under the influence:  if you
want it to be about raves/parties/etc. then there you go.  i've
seen and done some pretty stupid stuff at events.

if you want it to be about a mormon dance, then i apologize.

It wasn't until now that I really noticed his
fasionable attire- 70's terry-cloth shirt, short
tennis shorts with a stripe on the side, could it all
have been for me?
My mind raced at the thought of this new side of
things-
I tried to concentrate on my driving but this was just
too much- I focused ahead but stole glances, and
always watched him out of the corner of my eye.
I saw his eyes occasionally look up at me, then away,
never interrupting his incessant rhythmic stroking-
I thought I noticed a bit of drool coming off his
chin, but I dare not look directly over at him.
Then I noticed him running his tongue over his lips,
taking the drool with it.
I suppose I was right.
With a sudden grunt, he seemed to fall over on to me-
before I could even react, his head was laying on my
leg.
I looked down, yes, drool.
He looked up at me with his big brown eyes with a
quizzical look, as if he wasn't quite sure what he was
doing.
His tag glinted in the oncoming headlights-
"Crotchmaster" it said- his tongue was now slurping
again.
This was just getting messy all over my pants- "Bad
Dog!" I yelled out.
Steve0 reluctantly went back to his side of the car.
I focused on the road again, but quickly looked back
at him very confused-
Who dressed my dog was in that shirt and shorts?
Some questions were never meant to be answered I suppose.

This, however, was the least of my worries. The drugs had taken hold.

"Take the wheel you filthy beast!" I howled as the asphalt -- solid, mere
moments ago -- twisted and churned beneath the wheels of my  mom's
minivan, black lava lapping against the doors in slowly mounting waves.
Soon, they would crash overhead and that crap would be into the air ducts.
We were not equipped to breathe asphalt.

Steve0's saucerlike eyes rolled in terror as his focus shifted from wang
to wheel, darting back and forth in panic. "I don't want to die man!" he
whined.

"WE WILL IF THAT GODDAMN ASPHALT GETS INTO THE AIR DUCTS!" I bellowed,
thrashing in my seat. I gave him a rough shove aside, reaffirming my role
as captain of this ship. Never send an etard to do a man's job.

Horns blared somewhere, far in the distance - lights strobed across my
field of vision. A sharp jerk to the left seemed to calm things down,
silencing the screams of my charges.

"Will you kids stop--"

"There!" Jessie, from the back seat, jabbed a finger past my face, the
motion sending distorted ripples through the already thickening air.
Another sharp tug on the wheel, and I applied the emergency break to calm
the angry roar of the engine.

"Someone take the wheel. I'm going to shake this joker down for
information," I mumbled, clawing at my seatbelt and launching myself out
the driver's-side window. The door was rigged. I knew it.

Brush some gravel from the old skivvies (they'll love my tie-dye
longjohns, I mused) and a sharp tug to the ole beanie as I get to my feet.
Give him the look. There, in the shadows, a terrified-looking kid in pants
big enough to fit two dogs and a moderately endowed chinese girl. I put on
my most reassuring smile, and began my sauntering approach.

quizzical look, as if he wasn't quite sure what he was
doing.
His tag glinted in the oncoming headlights-
"Crotchmaster" it said- his tongue was now slurping
again.
This was just getting messy all over my pants- "Bad
Dog!" I yelled out.
Steve0 reluctantly went back to his side of the car.
I focused on the road again, but quickly looked back
at him very confused-
Who dressed my dog was in that shirt and shorts?
Some questions were never meant to be answered I suppose.

Subject: [sfraves] SF liberation radio benefit : Dec 11:1015 folsom: live, dance, and
 djs

Hi folks,
I'll be hosting some of the folks involved with this benefit on the
radio tomorrow morning.  Be sure to listen in, and be sure to support
the cause to.  SFLR has been a GREAT resource for SF over the years,
including amazing coverage during the war protests.

90.1 FM, 9a-Noon (http://kzsulive.stanford.edu)




SFLR is a micro-radio station that has broadcast at
93.7 FM in the S.F. Bay Area for the past 10 years.
SFLR has been a dedicated outlet and resource for
communities underserved by the media mainstream. On
Aug. 19, 2003, S.F. Board of Supervisors supported the
station, citing the need for media diversity in
general, and directed the SF police to leave the
station alone.

On Oct. 16, 2003, Appr. 10 federal agents, 10 S.F.
police, and 5 FCC agents equipped with battering ram
and firearms raided SFLR studios. The FCC confiscated
all equipment in the station. SFLR has been a vocal
critic of the Bush administration policies regarding
the war on terror and on media consolidation in
general.

Currently 10 parent companies control the radio
spectrum. Viacom and Clear Channel alone control 42
percent of listeners and 45 percent of industry
revenue. The FCC and Clear Channel have shut down any
initiative to let communities have their own micro
power radio.

We are responding with nuclear armeggedon.

no, just kidding. we are responding with art,
intellect, media, conversation, live music, and ripper
deejays... 1015 folsom has donated the space for our
insane installation. this benefit is for Liberation
Radio's cause, all the acts artists and producers are
donating their time to make one deafening, fire
spewing act of bass driven futility. was it over when
the germans bombed pearl harbor ?? hell no.

Line-Up:

Live: F-Space, Cookie Mongoloid, Tom Jonesing,
Transcender, Danny Shorago and more

DJ=92s: Adam Ohana, Laird, The Brass Tax / Boombox djs,
Space Cowboys vs. Halon Crew on battledecks with live MC

San Francisco Liberation Radio Raided!


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 16, 2003
SAN FRANCSICO -- Approximately 10 federal agents, 10
San Francisco police, and 5 FCC agents raided San
Francisco Liberation Radio (SFLR) studios yesterday.
The raid began at 11 a.m., and lasted for
approximately 2 hours. They arrived equipped with
battering ram and firearms, although neither was
necessary. The FCC confiscated all equipment in the
station at the time, including a 16 channel Mackie
sound board, microphones, a computer, CD, record, and
tape players, and so much more.

SFLR and its supporters view this attack within the
context of media consolidation. Currently 10 parent
companies control the radio spectrum. Viacom and Clear
Channel alone control 42 percent of listeners and 45
percent of industry revenue. Since the passage of the
1996 Telecommunications Act Clear Channel grew from 40
stations nationwide to 1,240. In 28 of the 30 major
music formats, 4 companies control over 50 percent of
listeners, and the same holds true for two thirds of
the nations news radio listeners. A debate about media
ownership, competition, localism, and diversity is
currently raging in the halls of Congress, in the
nations court systems, and on the streets. SFLR has
contributed its view of grass roots media activism to
this debate, and for this it has been targeted.

SFLR has been a vocal critic of the Bush
administration policies regarding the war on terror in
Iraq and elsewhere, as well as the California state
and local policies including San Francisco's targeting
of homeless people. The Bush administration has made
every effort to silence criticism of the government.
Dick Cheney, in a rare speech just several days ago
warned against public dissent. Donald Rumsfeld has
clearly insinuated that criticism of Bush
administration policies is killing the American troops
in Iraq. And yet the killing of innocent civilians in
Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and Oakland continues on
a daily basis. The next major anti-war demonstration
is taking place on October 25th, and includes a major
convergence in San Francisco. SFLR sees this
unprecedented attack on the station within the context
of these national and international events.

The crowd there was pretty Groovy... I mean... there were what seemed
like a good bunch of preppy people, but a few of them were kinda dancing
& was diggin' Felix's set... well.. it was pretty much a mix crowd
there... but it was all Groovy people though & I had fun for as long as
I was there... I mean.. the dance flor ain't all to big either, but it's

Miami Club Owners Speak Against RAVE Act

Louis Puig, owner of Space34 in Miami, recently blasted the government's 
crackdown on clubs in a written statement: "The notion that Space34 and 
this nation's night clubs are the source of drug abuse in our society is a 
blanket statement that is nothing short of ludicrous.  Listening to music 
and dancing is not a crime.  Our government is using the unconstitutional 
Amber Bill / Rave Act / Crack House Law to try and shut down night clubs, 
concerts and public gatherings.  These establishments should not be blamed 
for the inefficiency of our nation to control the importation, 
distribution, sales and use of illegal drugs.  Shutting down night clubs 
will not stop people from doing drugs."

Crobar Miami's manager Paulo Pincente spoke out against America's RAVE Act 
in DJ Magazine:  "It is jeopardizing the very existence of nightlife in the 
US.  One irresponsible clubber caught with drugs on the premises can 
potentially force the closure of an entire club."  And, the RAVE Act is 
only the tip of what's in store.

If sponsors of two bills in the U.S. House have their way, the CLEAN-UP 
Meth Act of 2003 and the Ecstasy Awareness Act of 2003 will give federal 
prosecutors additional means to shutdown electronic music events and 
venues.  If you haven't already done so, please visit the EM:DEF Action 
Center (link below) and write your Representative to voice your opposition 
to these bills.

New York Cabaret Laws Up for Repeal

The city of New York may repeal a controversial 1926 law which requires 
bars and nightclubs to obtain a special cabaret license if they allow 
dancing.  In 1997, Mayor Giuliani stepped up enforcement of the cabaret law 
as the Nightlife Enforcement Task Force targeted bar and nightclub owners 
in his Quality of Life campaign.  The Bloomberg administration at first 
continued the campaign, but with complaints by activists and business 
owners Gretchen Dykstra, the commissioner of the city's Department of 
Consumer Affairs announced that it will submit a plan to the City Council 
to repeal the law, replacing it with a "nightlife license" addressing 
issues neighbors are concerned about: noise, dirty sidewalks, and 
disorderly patrons.

Legalize Dancing NYC is a group of business owners, dance enthusiasts, dj's 
and concerned citizens working to repeal the jazz era laws that allow the 
citation and closure of bars when their customers are caught dancing.  The 
organization has built a base of support and secured an attorney to 
represent their cause.  Legalize Dancing NYC's next challenge will be 
getting the City Council to approve the repeal plan introduced by 
Bloomberg's office.

Not everyone in the nightclub industry agrees with repealing the cabaret 
laws.  Robert Bookman, a lawyer for the New York Nightlife Association, 
says clubs that went through the expensive and lengthy process of getting a 
license should not see their competitors receive the same benefits with 
none of the cost.

EM:DEF encourages our readers to review the points of view and take action 
accordingly.  If you support the repeal, sign the Legalize Dancing NYC 
petition on their web site.  If you are a resident of New York, e-mail your 
city council member urging them to support the repeal.  Visit the links 
below to learn more.

 He may have one the election, but it was an amazing

IMHO. Considering the resources they had to deal with.
AFAIK this is the closest a Green has gotten to a
major position. We got all the propositions we wanted
passed.

Yep, if the Greens would have won, I am sure it would have helped convinced
Nader to run and put Bush in the white house again.

yes, I am still very bitter about the Greens.

I confess I was bummed out last night...but the results were very 
encouraging.  One must consider that the very well-entrenched, well funded, 
and highly organized Democratic establishment was behind Newsom.  Matt had 
been campaigning for a few months with a very limited budget vs Newsom's 
year-long effort and millions in contributions.

Change is in the air, and I believe it has nothing to do with political 
parties (ie, Green vs Democrats).  This was one of the most energetic 
campaigns I have been involved with in SF, and Matt did much to move the 
apathetic and cynical into the ranks of the involved and hopeful.  This is 
just the beginning.  The challenge as I see it now is to maintain the raw 
political structure Matt created rather quickly.

Love,

Apollo

Our new guy just told us he has to go... and we need a super cool roomie!!!
Our place is awesome and you should be too :)

Roommate Ad:

***PICS*** Master BR avail. NOW --- __Exquisite Views of SF!!__

We are looking for 1 person to share our spacious, 4-bedroom townhouse, 1 
full and 2 half baths and a GREAT outdoor deck where we enjoy spectacular 
sunsets nightly and incredible postcard views of San Francisco from Yerba 
Buena Island (the lush hill next to Treasure Island, halfway across the Bay 
Bridge)!  Imagine watching all the fireworks shows in the City from the 
comfort of your own home...  Ours is arguably the best unit and view on the 
island! Plus there's lots of tranquil outdoor space on both Yerba Buena and 
Treasure Islands for hiking, biking, picnics and more.  And we rock too!  
The room is available NOW.


THE VIEW from our apartment

(the living room, kitchen, all bedrooms and the back deck all have views 
similar to these images)

The main living space is large with two areas (dining, and a living room 
with high ceilings), a full kitchen (gas), and a huge back-deck.  Did I 
mention the sweeping view of the City? Plus there are a few surprises up our 
sleeves. Basic utilities are INCLUDED with the rent! (see full Amenities 
list below)

San Francisco, Berkeley, AND Oakland are all VERY CONVENIENT to the islands, 
since we're halfway across the Bay Bridge. It's only 4 minutes to downtown 
San Francisco (7-10 with traffic) by car (my commute to and from Oakland is 
a *breeze*) and it's an easy, quick MUNI hop to downtown SF 24/7. 
Additionally, there's a convenience store, an ATM, a Cafe (B'fast/lunch 
only) and nice space for hiking/biking on the island.


THE ROOM:

Master Bedroom: 13.5' x 11.5', Great view of SF skyline!, high ceiling, 
gigantic closet (it runs the full length of the room).  Also, attached to 
this room is a 1/2 bath with a large linen closet.  ($740)  Available Now!


AMENITIES:

Free parking! (also a short, easy MUNI hop downtown)

Free utilities! (electric, gas, H2O and waste removal)

Also: laundry, dishwasher, disposal, DSL / LAN, high ceilings, very safe, 
quiet neighborhood, sunny space, postcard City and sunset view from all 
rooms, large outdoor deck.

We share costs of iDSL, NetFlix, the w/d rental (cheap), bottled H2O, and 
biweekly Planet Organics deliveries.  And we have housecleaners come 
every-other week.


US:

Beth, Danny, and Jessica.  We're all between 24-27 and are very chill but 
like to throw killer parties on occasion, super-friendly, open, ecclectic, 
and looking for someone cool to fill the one remaining void in the house...

Namely, we're looking for someone who wants to build a harmonious, 
cooperative, respectful household that isn't centered around the TV and 
isn't just people locked away in their room.  We don't have to be best of 
friends, but we'd like to at least enjoy your company since we will share 
common space.  (The 3 of us get along famously!)  Mature, respectful 
individuals, please.


YOU:

Employed, 24-33ish, responsible, cool, interested in a respectful, 
cooperative and creative atmosphere, okay with a mish-mash of partying and 
quiet and living in an unbelievable place.

Deposit is $700.

No pets.

Email us and tell us a bit about yourself, like what you're looking for in a 
household/roommates, any questions you may have, and some days/times you 
would be able to meet with us.

Hope to see you here soon!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Newsom

Why blame the green's for a vote that came down to the supreme court and
problems with florida?  In the areas where greens actually voted, they
were mostly democrats anyway and would've won with the democratic
electoral college vote in that area regardless.  If you're going to
break a 2 party system you've got to keep hacking at it.  Just because
it failed the first time does not mean you give up.  If that were true
we wouldn't have this country in the first place.  The puritans would've
been slaughtered/died of starvation with no more colonization, and Spain
would probably now have most of the US and still probably have Mexico.

Yep, if the Greens would have won, I am sure it would have helped
convinced Nader to run and put Bush in the white house again.

yes, I am still very bitter about the Greens.

Subject: [sfraves] Gatekeeper Inspection Announcement

My name is Deepfog, though you ought to know that by now if you've paid 
attention for the last, oh, 10 or so years.  A few years ago, I decided 
I am the gatekeeper of San Francisco.  And why not?  Some guy named 
Norton declared himself the Emporer of San Francisco, at least I don't 
rule with an iron fist.

Unless I get pissed off.  And some of you invariably piss me off, so 
I'm going to fly in for an inspection of the city, its contents, its 
inhabitants, its ravers (are there any left?) ... and I'm certain I'll 
be issuing *lots* of citations.  Because for one, you people have moved 
from the East Coast and driven up the rent in my city!  Not to mention 
the late night coalition is still being run by that purple-haired 
pervert!

And, and ...

I will be meeting with the other gatekeepers, Gatekeeper Jr. and 
Gatekeeper  Sr. to discuss the current situation in San Francisco and 
what we intend to do about it, if anything.


See you January 1st.   And don't beat yourself up if you can't figure 
this email out.  I've been trying unsuccessfully to figure myself out 
for years.

--0-136292742-1071137665=:29558
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Word.......as a still somewhat beginner DJ I can definitely agree with Joey.  I thought it was going to be the easiest thing in the world to beat match two records when I first started spinning (seeing as I have a musical background and am good at math.)  I wanted to try to incorporated all theses neat little DJ tricks into all my little mixes and look cool.  All that happened was I sounded like shit and made an ass of myself in front of a bunch of my friends.  Best advice I could give would be: Master your beat matching.......Don't let the tables beat your ass, any two records can mix.......When you are at home, no matter how many people you have over (unless you are having a party and you are the DJ) you are learning, not preforming, Don't worry about looking cool, just keep your head in your mix and get it right.......Don't freak out and over compensate if the beats start train recking.........If your headphones have a nob on your mixer that pans from channel to channel USE IT,
 you will learn to love it and thank me later.........Keep one ear in your headphones at all times so you can tell what sound is coming from what record (very important for new DJs who haven't gotten to know their tracks yet, also good with new records)............LEARN YOUR RECORDS........Don't be afraid of your pitch control adjuster, if one record keeps losing the beat adjust the pitch accordingly..........AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST, this shit takes time, DON'T GIVE UP!!!
-Graham
Hope that helped........

Joey Frisco <josephwhunt@hotmail.com> wrote:
I'd suggest working your ass off to get your beat matching on point before 
you try to learn any tricks. Beat matching is the most fundamental and 
important thing when mixing. It doesn't matter how many tricks you can do, 
or how on point you can cut if your beats sound like sneakers in the dryer. 
After that, I'd work on phrasing and cutting. Then programming a set, I 
guess. If you can figure out all of those things, you're in a better place 
then half of the people who pretend to be dj's. Oh, and once you've learned 
to beat match fairly consistantly, learn to pitch-bend (adjusting the pitch 
live without touching the platter). This makes your live performance sound 
a lot cleaner (I'm still working on my pitch bending, touching the platter 
is a hard habit to break, if I had to start over again I'd learn to only 
pitch bend). Once you've mastered the fundamentals, you can learn new ways 
to mix, fade, cut, drop, and scratch; but I'd wait until I had the other 
stuff down before I worked on the advanced stuff.
Cheers and goodluck,
Joey

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: tonight = midori mushi (not thirstybear)

no thirstybear this week, some other DJ is bringing his crew
in.
but i'll be spinning solo at my favorite sushi bar again: 
midori mushi!

THIS THURSDAY (and maybe more thursdays to come)
midori mushi
465 grove x gough
7pm-11pm :: free
415-503-1377

you thought thirstybear management was crazy?  wait until you
meet gerard.  he's fucking nuts.  like, really nuts.  but sort
of in a good way.  i think.

i'll be spinning something good - don't know what, but it'll be
what *I* want, not "muzak for marina yuppies".  hah.  

if that doesn't get you, the sushi will.  it's quite possibly
some of the best i've had in years.  people who know me, know
that i love my sushi.  if you end up going, be it tonight or
some other night, you have to try the "speak soft" rolls. 
they're teh shit.

so come out...or don't come out - i'll be plastered either way.
 one thing for sure, you shouldn't miss the "sticky" party this
saturday.

What?  If half the Greens who voted for Nader in Florida voted for Gore
instead, Bush would not be in office now.

Voting green is a great fantasy.. but the reality of politics dictate you
fight your political wars one battle at a time.  And the battle now is
to remove Bush by any means necessary.

What good is a 3rd party... when all it will do is insure constant victory
for the Republicans?

follow the money - the people with extravagant lighting displays pay other 
people to set it up, and don't mind forking over a couple hundred to PG&E 
every night.  I'm not sure where the affluence is on the peninsula, but I 
could talk about the East Bay... Also, Chico has a neighborhood that goes 
off too.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Newsom

But they voted their consience and in a democratic society that's just
what we need to do.  Democrats and Republicas are almost exactly alike
now.  I'm reading a book where it used to be the republicans for civil
rights and democrats under president Wilson who is proclaimed to be a
hero was a white supremacist who tried to stifle the initial struggles
of womens sufferage, resegregated public offices and replace white
people in positions that were majority black again.  Change takes time
without forceful revolution and if people keep voting republican or
democrat, no change will ever be made as the parties both become more
and more the same.  We may lose at first and it may cost us dearly, but
the mistakes that Wilson made and the people of that time remember, his
would be sucessor lost by the largest landslide in presidential history
to a republican who hadn't campaigned at all.  We've got to be the
change we want to see, not continue to choose the lesser of two evils in
our minds.  Bush's popularity rating for reelcection is very low, and
you're right, if more people vote green and Dean loses because of it
that doesn't mean it wasn't in vain.  3% registered voters in San
Francisco were Green yet Gonzales still pulled 47% of the vote.  People
want change.  People are waking up.  Bush has made too many mistakes for
people not to start seeing this.  I'm sure a lot of greens will vote
Dean to get bush out of office first then go back to what they believe
in.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Newsom

I'm not talking about the individuals in power alone.  I'm talking more
about the parties themselves, the lobbying, the co-sponsored bills.  I
mean when you have Hatch and Kennedy writing bills together, that's just
enough right there to see ultra-conservative mormon and drunken liberal
catholic working together as if they were the same party.  The special
interests and their own personal interests are what run them.  They're
so well established that it doesn't really matter who's in office
because both are going to pass bad bills, and make up for it with a few
good bills.  Clinton's track record was better than Bush, but Clinton
was no way near being an incredible president, what with the Rwandan
massacre and our stuff over in Kosovo.  Its all about charisma and
telling people what they want to hear to join your cause.  What I see in
the green party although I myself don't claim a party is more of a
rebel, get things done, anti-big business aspect to them which reminds
me a lot of the radical republicas.  The whigs and the torries were
finally replaced, we need to start trying to replace the dems and repubs
because they've become too comfortable, too uncaring and too greedy.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Republicans and Democrats -- how different are they, really?

	When you look at the big picture, the two establishment parties are 
almost exactly alike. A few years back during the Clinton 
administration, there was a huge fight over the budget. There was talk 
of the government experiencing a temporary "shutdown" because the two 
sides couldn't agree. Guess how much of a difference in the federal 
budget the Republicans and Democrats were fighting over? Four percent! 
In the big picture this is practically nothing!

	Republican politicians talk a good game of being fiscally prudent and 
standing up for ordinary taxpayers. The reality is that they vote for 
bigger government and more spending right along with the Democrats. Now 
that Republicans control the presidency and both houses of Congress, 
spending is going up even faster than when Clinton was in charge. Of 
course government spending more money sooner or later means government 
taking more money out of your pocket.

	Democrats likewise talk a good game about being for civil liberties 
and civil rights. The reality is they go right along with Republicans 
in pouring billions of dollars into the war on drugs, imposing stiffer 
and stiffer criminal penalties, and passing unconstitutional laws that 
trash the Bill of Rights and ramp up the police state. It was a 
Democratic Senator who sponsored the anti-rave "Reducing America's 
Vulnerability to Ecstasy" legislation.

	Bush has killed innocent civilians by bombing other countries. So did 
Clinton, usually supported by Democrats in Congress. He bombed Sudan 
and Bosnia, and sent troops to Bosnia, Kosovo, and Somalia. Democratic 
presidents got the United States into both World Wars, the Korean War, 
and the Vietnam War. Both Republican and Democrat leaders use military 
power as a tool not to champion freedom and democracy around the world 
where people are oppressed, but in order to advance U.S. interests or 
maintain the global status quo on behalf of their buddies who run the 
other governments of the world. Both parties have supported an 
expanding military budget and maintaining a large nuclear arsenal even 
after the Soviet Union collapsed from the weight of its own bloated and 
super-powerful government.

	Both Republicans and Democrats favor continuing the "winner take all" 
voting system and restrictive ballot access and campaign laws that 
place alternative parties like the Libertarians and Greens at a 
disadvantage. Each establishment party seeks to keep its supporters 
afraid the other party is going to do something horrible to them, thus 
they keep Americans voting for one or the other half of the two-party 
duopoly. In reality, Democrat and Republican leaders share the same 
primary concern: Maintaining their ability to control us and spend our 
money.

								<<< Starchild >>>


"The only partisan difference was that the Democrat bashed the budget 
before making the case for more money, while the Republican praised the 
budget before asking for more."

	-Michael Lynch of Reason Magazine, commenting on a "Hardball" TV show 
exchange between representatives of the two parties over Bush's budget, 
April 12, 2001 (http://reason.com/ml/ml041201.shtml)

This site has some pretty good data. I've been a fan of Moore but
I am starting to seriously question him now (sigh).

Yeah- that's how I felt too... I was never a big fan
or anything, but seeing that film was pretty thought
provoking.
Specifically with Charlton Heston- my opinion of him
had been one of basic integrity and decency.  Surely
not the racist, insensitve lunatic that he's portrayed
as.  But when I fist saw this information it all made
sense, and I then knew what that "uneasy" feeling was
when I was watching it.

It's kinda like when you found out Santa wasn't real
isn't it?

Subject: [sfraves]nrr: Help me find a club for NYE!!

Since this is my first NYE being 21, I really want to get down at a club.  
Preferably with house and hiphop.  I know the DNA lounge is playing house 
and atmospheric soul, and they have a 40 cover, which isn't bad compared to 
other clubs.  This will deprive my hiphop loving folks though!  Do you know 
of any clubs that play both house and hiphop?  I'm running out of time and 
I'm unsure of which club to pick.

Thanks all.

Yea, but no matter if you factor in the movie or not, Charleton Heston IS a 
racist, insensitive lunatic.

Can we say fundamentalist Christian anyone?

Gee why don't ask Bush what he thinks of Clinton? Ask me what I think of DJ
Scribble? Ask Schwarzenegger what he think of Bustamante....you guys getting

i gotta read the rest of that site when i have time (i'm at work). 
thanks for the link.

scanning over it, it looks like MMoore's tactics would probably go 
along just fine in Washington. do the ends justify the means?  i'm 
still wrestling with that.

Just something I ran across on his site.
 
* http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/wackoattacko/ *
 
*shurgs* he's just a liberal/green pundit. why should he be any different from the rest?

thanks for the link.

scanning over it, it looks like MMoore's tactics would probably go 
along just fine in Washington. do the ends justify the means? i'm 
still wrestling with that.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Republicans and Democrats -- how different are they, really?

Did you even read the link I posted?

Apparently not, else you wouldn't have missed out on
this:
(I'm cutting and pasting the Race section because
you're a lazy fuck, and like commenting on things
before you read them)

8. Race. Moore does not directly state that Heston is
a racist--he is the master of creating the false
impression --but reviewers come away saying "Heston
looks like an idiot, and a racist one at that" Source.
"BTW, one thing the Heston interview did clear up,
that man is shockingly racist." Source.

    The remarks stem from Heston's answer (after Moore
keeps pressing for why the US has more violence than
other countries) that it might be due to the US
"having a more mixed ethnicity" than other nations,
and "We had enough problems with civil rights in the
beginning." A viewer who accepts Moore's theme that
gun ownership is driven by racial fears might conclude
that Heston is blaming blacks and the civil rights
movement.

    But if you look at some history missing from
Bowling, you get exactly the opposite picture. Heston
is talking, not about race, but about racism. In the
early 1960s, the civil rights movement was fighting
for acceptance. Civil rights workers were being
murdered. The Kennedy Administration, trying to hold
together a Democratic coalition that ranged from
liberals to fire-eater segregationists such as George
Wallace and Lester Maddox, found the issue too hot to
touch, and offered little support.

    Heston got involved. He picketed discriminating
restaurants. He worked with Martin Luther King, and
helped King break Hollywood's color barrier (yes,
there was one.). He led the actors' component of
King's 1963 march in Washington, which set the stage
for the key civil rights legislation in 1964.

    Here's Heston's comments at the 2001 Congress on
Racial Equality Martin Luther King dinner (presided
over by NRA director, and CORE President, Roy Innes).
More on Heston.

    Most of the viewers were born long after the
events Heston is recalling. To them, the civil rights
struggle consists of Martin Luther King speaking,
people singing "We Shall Overcome," and everyone
coming to their senses. Heston remembers what it was
really like.

    If Heston fails to explain this in Bowling, we've
got to note that Moore (despite his claim that he left
the interview almost unedited) cut a lot of the
interview out. Watch closely and you'll see a clock on
the wall near Moore's head. When it's first seen, the
time is about 5:47. When Heston finally walks out, it
reads about 6:10. That's 23 minutes. I clocked the
Heston interview in Bowling at 5 1/4 minutes. About
three-quarters of what Heston did say was trimmed out.
[Why the clock indicates six o'clock, when Moore is
specific that he showed up for the interview at 8:30
AM, will have to await another investigation!]

Subject: [sfraves] BE.ES.PEE !! Sticky II !! SATURDAY !! :: SF :: $10 :: FREE spirits (drinky kind) :: 9pm - 5am

This is the LAST BSP you will see from us. Tickets are close to gone (no...
really... you guys are starting to wake up out there!) and it seems like
once again we're going to end up selling a few extra at the door. Door
tickets are $15 so don't slack and end up paying more! Even if you did pay
$15 you would still be getting a party with insane amounts of FREE liquor,
beer, wine, and the usual quality food spread. I don't know how much more of
an excuse you need to come out with the rest of your friends on Saturday
than this!

Reply to this email or hit me up on good ol' aim: sninesix

:: r y a n ::

<!-- Original.BSP.below -->

I'm sure a lot of your remember the last Sticky party from 420 this past
April. If you were there then you also know what to expect in terms of food,
drink., and most important music and friends! This Saturday, December 13th
we once again bring you Sticky!

The holiday madness is upon us and it's time to get everyone under one roof
for a family reunion. We've prepared a solid lineup the SF Bay's finest
house, breaks, and downtempo for your listening enjoyment. The key to any
Sticky event is the space. Remember how amazing that last spot was?? Well
we've got another NEW space that really is NEW! No, really... it's badass
space that hasn't been used for a party until now. The space is a large,
cozy 2 room loft with ample outdoor space complete with a garden in back and
fire pit! How many spots in SF do you know like that? I sure as hell haven't
seen the like. The fire pit will surely add to the charm and warmth that
surrounds this holiday season.

Like the last Sticky, all drinks and food are complimentary. Translated...
free open bar with free food to match. Drink up, eat lots and be funky like
always! Food and drink wise we'll have a lot just like the last time. I
don't think anyone was hungry or complained about lack of "spirits"

This party is being powered by Evite and we would *GREATLY* appreciate you
letting us know via Evite if you intend to come. The link is below. You can
use PayPal too!

SELLING OUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

Christopher Scheer, AlterNet

The near-defeat of Democratic nominee Gavin Newsom in the San Francisco 
mayoral race is yet another example of the self-destructive strategy of the 
party leadership.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Yes really- that rebutts nothing-

Look how weasely he is:

"The Truth: Heston took his NRA show to Denver and did
and said exactly what we recounted. From the end of my
narration setting up Heston's speech in Denver, with
my words, "a big pro-gun rally," every word out of
Charlton Heston's mouth was uttered right there in
Denver, just 10 days after the Columbine tragedy."

Right- great Michael, that's technically correct-
every word *after* the cut to you was spoken by Heston
at some point in his speech that day.  But Doug, do
you *really* not have a problem with how his words
were cut up and re-arranged to present a face that was
very much *not* the entire message of Heston's speech?
You don't mind being deceived like that?

Yeah-

Just as a note, the rubuttal to this (Michael Moore's
I-hesitate-to-even-call-it-a-rebuttal) is also linked
to from the original site I linked.

Wow that sentence doesn't *even* make sense- well- I
think you know what I mean.

"Yeah Michael, because the guy is a contributing
editor to a gun magazine, suddenly his facts arent
facts anymore."

The narcissitic personality thing really has me
leaning :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Republicans and Democrats -- how different are they, really?

Yea, this is part of that speech Heston made...enjoy.

"But on the other hand, I find my blood pressure rising when Clinton's 
cultural shock troops participate in homosexual-rights fund-raisers but 
boycott gun-rights fund-raisers... and then claim it's time to place 
homosexual men in tents with Boy Scouts, and suggest that sperm donor babies 
born into lesbian relationships are somehow better served and more loved.

Such demands have nothing to do with equality. They're about the currency of 
cultural war—money and votes—and the Clinton camp will let anyone in the 
tent if there's a donkey on his hat, or a check in the mail or some yen in 
the fortune cookie.

Mainstream America is depending on you—counting on you—to draw your sword 
and fight for them. These people have precious little time or resources to 
battle misguided Cinderella attitudes, the fringe propaganda of the 
homosexual coalition, the feminists who preach that it's a divine duty for 
women to hate men, blacks who raise a militant fist with one hand while they 
seek preference with the other, and all the New-Age apologists for juvenile 
crime, who see roving gangs as a means of youthful expression, sex as a 
means of adolescent merchandising, violence as a form of entertainment for 
impressionable minds, and gun bans as a means to lord-knows-what. We've 
reached that point in time when our national social policy originates on 
Oprah. I say it's time to pull the plug."


Yea...he says he was involved with MLK way back when, but then turns around 
and spews this kind of shit. He's not intolerant or leaning entirely on 
stereotypes at all...noooooooo...not ol' Chuck.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Republicans and Democrats -- how different are they, really?

Did you even read what you just pasted?

His views expressed in your excerpts below are not
fighting against the groups he mentions, rather he is
upset by the back-handed hypocritical nature of what
drives tolerance and acceptance.
 
The paragraph immediately preceeding the one you
pasted is this:

"The gay and lesbian movement is another good example.
Many homosexuals are hugely talented artists and
executives... also dear friends. I don't despise their
lifestyle, though I don't share it. As long as gay and
lesbian Americans are as productive, law-abiding and
private as the rest of us, I think America owes them
absolute tolerance. It's the right thing to do."

My take on him (after reading his entire speech here:
http://www.vpc.org/nrainfo/speech.html ) is that yeah,
he's an old guy, and consequently has some
old-fashioned ideas about certain things, but on the
whole seems to be all about an America where everyone
is equal- period.  We all have the same rights and
opportunities, and nobody has to feel bad about who
they are.
That's what I'm about too.

So that's that- in any case, the racist and intolerant
way he was portrayed by Moore was ridiculous by any
measure.

(and go look up the word "stereotype"- a stereotype,
by definition, is true)

"Four percent!
In the big picture this is practically nothing!"

That's the kind of thinking that gets us into the situation we're in in CA.
Try and understand the difference in the mid 90's and now.  And try to
understand the difference between huge increases in spending and huge
increases in the annual deficit.  Not the same thing.

Moore isn't the only one responsible for this mess of people believing the
crap he created in
that movie.  The MPAA also is, or whoever is in charge of the academy
awards.  The movie
was entered as a Documentary and voted on as such, etc.  Documentaries do
not have to be
completely true (many documentaries will show evidence that's inconclusive,
then suggest
what popular theory best fits the evidence).  But Moore's movie fabricates
information, then
tells you that in no uncertain terms this is the only true theory.  He makes
my skin crawl,
what a creep.

Read the first site and quit listening to this slob Moore.  Evidence is
evidence, so read it.

"Well of course it was staged! It's a movie! We built the "bank" as a set
and then I hired actors to play the bank tellers and the manager and we got
a toy gun from the prop department and then I wrote some really cool
dialogue for me and them to say! Pretty neat, huh?"

---As I said earlier, Bowling was in the category "Documentary" and you tell
me that when
someone watches it as it is called (by Moore, the academy, etc.) they aren't
going to believe
that scene wasn't stagged?  Can't have it both ways Mr. Moore.

To sum up:  Clinton's cronies participate in fund raising for nothing more
than someone's
sexual orientation, yet boycott against fund raisers designed to support the
constitution
(right to bear arms).

I fail to see the problem here?  He's not denouncing homosexuals, he's
denouncing those
indicated for what I just said.

Subject: [sfraves] Need INFINITE BEAT bsp for NYE [was Re: [sfraves] Thank You!!]

Hey out there, sorry I couldn't make it to UPLIFT, just wiped out from work
and saving some energy for Sticky II.

I was seeking the BSP (info) for the Wish party on New Year's Eve (Infinite
Beat)--it might be underground, though, so if necessary, please reply off
list.

Otherwise,I will be stuck going to a huge gay massive (circuit party) at the
Mezzazine, Flesh & Fantasy NYE, with Falcon porn superstars and go-go gods.

Everyone, we need your help...
 
First of all, thank you to everyone who attended Intensify on Friday. Kuma was once again blown away by Northern California's enthusiasm....everyone did an outstanding job.
 
We have just viewed pictures from the show and literally half of the images are corrupt due to a bad memory stick. If anyone took pictures at Intensify we will be more than glad to make it worth your while as we'd love to post the pictures on our site.
 
Please let us know by replying to this or email us at xtortproductions@yahoo.com
 
Thank you all for your support and get ready for VERSUS on Jan.30th

Ah yes, the aircraft carrier that was in sight of land, so a helicopter 
would have done.  Then the turkey dinner.  Even Stars and Stripes had 
issues with that performance:

A Baghdad Thanksgiving's Lingering Aftertaste

By Dana Milbank

Friday, December 12, 2003; Page A35

Stars and Stripes, the Pentagon-authorized newspaper of the U.S. military, 
is bucking for a court-martial.

When last we checked in on Stripes, it was reporting on a survey it did of 
troops in Iraq, finding that half of those questioned described their 
units' moral as low and their training as insufficient and said they did 
not plan to reenlist.

With the Pentagon just recovering from that, Stars and Stripes is blowing 
the whistle on President Bush's Thanksgiving visit to Baghdad, saying the 
cheering soldiers who met him were pre-screened and others showing up for a 
turkey dinner were turned away.

The newspaper, quoting two officials with the Army's 1st Armored Division 
in an article last week, reported that "for security reasons, only those 
preselected got into the facility during Bush's visit. . . . The soldiers 
who dined while the president visited were selected by their chain of 
command, and were notified a short time before the visit."

The paper also published a letter to the editor from Sgt. Loren Russell, 
who wrote of the heroism of his soldiers and then added: "[I]magine their 
dismay when they walked 15 minutes to the Bob Hope Dining Facility, only to 
find that they were turned away from their evening meal because they were 
in the wrong unit. . . . They understand that President Bush ate there and 
that upgraded security was required. But why were only certain units turned 
away?"

Russell added that his soldiers "chose to complain amongst themselves and 
eat MREs, even after the chow hall was reopened for 'usual business' at 9 
p.m. As a leader myself, I'd guess that other measures could have been 
taken to allow for proper security and still let the soldiers have their meal."

The 1st Armored Division officials told Stars and Stripes that all soldiers 
had the opportunity to get a proper Thanksgiving meal -- possibly more than 
the newspaper's editors will get in Guantanamo next year.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

So even after Moore says it was stagged you think it's real?  I don't get
it.
But I stand by my point. Hey, here's another...how about playing the sax
(badly) on TV to appear hip and young to the voting audience?  It's
politics,
so what.

Yes I did.  Here's where he said it:  ""Well of course it was staged! It's a

some really cool dialogue for me and them to say! Pretty neat, huh?"

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Sticky!

So, sticky was the pooh last night!  That's a good thing.  We had an amazing 
time and it was great meeting some SFR folks.  It was nice seeing Angie and 
RedStickMan again.  Angie, it was really cool getting to know each other a 
bit more and learning about KCK vs. KCMo'.  'Stick, Sorry we didn't have 
more of a chance to talk (other than the sushi party plans, lol).  I was 
baby-sitting much the night, but I know that Magnasty and Poshta had a 
really good time despite their drunken swordsmanships.  Actually they were 
both still drunk this morning when they woke up on my futon, ha ha.  If that 
isn't a sign of a good xmas party, what is?  Anyway, Thanks to the sticky 
crew for blessing us with a night of memories and drunken madness.
Wink, Wink,
Joey (don't call it) Frisco

PS.  Drop me a line the next time you head up to Horizon and we can see what 
kind of trouble I can stir up for ya. ;0)

With that being said, does anyone know where I can acquire any black market babies? I'm interested in the intenational sale and distribution of these wonderful products. :p

Subject: [sfraves] .: 2night | Dirtbox Radio | Relapse | Lycan | BLOOD EVERYWHERE! :.


Good afternoon, and welcome to your weekly Dirtbox Radio Promotional
Email.  We here at Dirtbox Radio strive to present to you the finest in
promotional emails, and hope that you enjoy reading them as much as we
enjoy writing them.

Dirtbox Radio begins broadcasting at 7pm Eastern Standard Time tonight, as
we have been doing for nearly .  Keeping with the tradition of bringing
you talented guest DJs from around the DC Metro area, we are proud to
present you with the following guest DJs:

9:30-11pm EST _Relapse_

When Relapse first came out to play on the show over a year ago, it was
obvious that he has a deep-seated love for drum 'n' bass, and the talent
to make it audible.  Focusing on the darker, tech-heavy side of drum 'n'
bass, his mixes are quite precise, energetic, and feature a wide variety
of artists.  As of late, Relapse has been holed up in his studio working
on tunes, so hopefully we'll twist his arm into playing an original or two
for us tonight.

08-9:30pm EST _Lycan_

Lycan initially caught our interest spinning breaks as Kenobi, when he
rolled out here with the Dartainian crew.  His energy and enthusiasm is
contagious, so when he mentioned that he spun drum 'n' bass as well, we
had to get him back out here.  Like so many others around the DC Metro
area, Lycan proves that talent is not just the domain of world famous DJs.

?? _Davey A_

We might just get the one like Davey A on the show tonight, as he's back
in town from West Virginia at the moment.  Dave's a good friend of the
Dirtbox Kru, a damn nice guy, and a solid DJ.  We're always glad to have
him on the show, to be blessed by his mixing and selection prowess.

To join the show tonight, just follow the links below:

Good god man, read!  See below where I said "Yes I did."?  Ok, good.  Now,
again, Mr. Moore's quote specifically states he stagged the whole bank
thing.
Get it??

So you didn't watch the interview with MM where he tries to defend his 
"movie."  get over it already.  He said it was a staged scene.  I've seen both.

If anything has ever gotten more NRR, this is it, please at least mark it as
such.  Better yet take it off list, or join a M. Moore mailing list and yak

Subject: [sfraves] going away party tonight

 To my friends and acquaintances. 
 Tonight is my going away party. Be there or be
square.  8ish till midnightish at the catclub. Forrest
Green is going to be spinning up some electro breaks,
another DJ TBA, and hopefuly Dr. Hal will make an
appearance. 
 I'm leaving on Thursday morning, so this is an
opportune time to come say "Farewell", "You're the
daddy", "F*ck you" or to send thugs to kick my
buttocks.

Best

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Republicans and Democrats -- how different are they, really?

It's pretty clear in that segment of his rant that the scene wasn't
staged.  He says, "Yeah, we staged it, neat, huh?", and then says:

"When you see me going in to the bank and walking out with my new gun
in "Bowling for Columbine" – that is exactly as it happened. Nothing
was done out of the ordinary other than to phone ahead and ask
permission to let me bring a camera in to film me opening up my
account. I walked into that bank in northern Michigan for the first
time ever on that day in June 2001, and, with cameras rolling, gave the
bank teller $1,000 – and opened up a 20-year CD account."

Looks like sarcasm, to me.

To me, even if the movie had been a ruse in toto, it shed light on a
desperately underexposed subject and stirred thought throughout the
nation.  The "other side" lies, cheats, and steals its way into power
and credibility, and I'll be damned if I'd condemn Michael Moore for
using those same tactics in opposition.

As it stands, if what he says about "not one lawsuit has been filed" is
true, then it stands to reason that he was in the right.  A large,
well-funded organization like the NRA would have sued the living sh*t
out of him if they thought they had a leg to stand on concerning libel
or slander- let alone good 'ol Heston!

I don't know if that's a joke or not, as I know
nothing about that particular cultural aspect of North
Korea- but yay for North Korea!

Next time I'm in that situation, I will conjure up the
tenacity and resolve of none other than Kim Jong II
himself! :P

Subject: [sfraves] COMPRESSION WAS SO DAMN AWESOME LASTNIGHT

OK... so like still feeling hella bad 4 missing out goin' 2 Sticky 'cause my poor ass is still broke & I kinda had the company of non ravers I was entertaining Sat night who had 2 get a few hours of sleep b4 they treked 2 some place like Mid Cali 2 visit some1 in prison... I couldn't make it ( I wanna see reviews SFRAVERS! =) 

So Jblaze ( he's now renamed Jaze 4 legal reasons & that name sounds Cooler =) & we made plans 2 go 2 Compression on Saturday night when i got home 4 Sunday & Sunday night came & it was on!! There was a DJ spinning frm LA who I caught when i was down there earlier this year that I couldn't miss him & his MC (NIGHTSTALKER (knowledge, 45psi, LA) with MC XYZ (45psi, LA)) & well... I was on GL anyway 'cause The Sleeveless Chicas hooked me up, but like Jaze & I went early 'cause well... the Sleeveless Girls opened up the night doin this Awesome Tag Set.. I Loved it... I meann... their set was pretty not mellow, but not hard.. there was alota like recent years tracks released that that played, some old skool, but man... I Loved it!!

OK... then close 2 midnight, NightStalker & MC XYZ came on & ooooooooh my goodness.. Hello 2Day... strait away... this Dark evil HARD jungle track starts bumping outta the speakers & I was in Hevean!!  Infact... the whole set was pretty dark & hard... i mean... it was so hard not 2 dance during this set.. it was so hard not 2 dance during this whole night so far 'cause even Sleeveless played tracks that made me get ouuta my seat like mondo times....

BUt yeah... Nightstalkers set was sick... I mean... he even played  few hardcore tracks during his set actually... the 1st hardcore track he spun  was Dope 'cause well... it went from Hardcore 2 breakcore 2 Jungle like all w/in like the 1st 3-5 mintues... (hmmmmm... a SwitchCraft track maybe?)... then the other Hardcore track he spun he jus' totally stopped spinning or like there was this long ass breakdown during 1 of his tracks... the he said...

"Who wants me to bump some hardcore?"

Ofcourse I was yeling my ass off 'cause Hello 2Day...

then he played this strait up evil hardcore track & me & Jaze were dancing so hard.. LoL... the break dancers didn't what the fuck was goin' on 'cuse there were 2 of them like batling the whole night 2 the Jungle... LoL.. so they jus' stood there... but they were dope!!

@ the end of his set... I totally had 2 talk 2 him & tell him what an Awesome fuckin' Job he did spinning!!  I mean... I Love seeing DJs when they get off behind the decks when they spin & this guy is like a cartoon character toy thing responsive to bass & percussion 'cause he moved accordingly to all his tracks,,, Loved it man!  So Dope! =)  Oh Yeah... the 2nd Hardcore was produced by Omar Santana 'cause I asked him & we had a talk about that also!!  This DJ NightStalker Dude is Hella Dope man!

Then UFO went on & it was Sick... he played off his computer when he started off & it was Sick... he started out w/ some hip hop then started playing this well.. it was like marching band music 4 a few minutes... funny song.. then back 2 some hip hop i think... then strait in2 Jungle... Jaze & I didn't stay 4 his whole set & I didn't get 2 talk 2 UFO 2 much lastnight... but man.. what a Groovy time it was lastnight!!

The crowd was kinda small... I mean.. there were some people I knew... but aparently.. there was this bowling thing that was sponsered by XLR8R (sp) magazine in Daly City so I didn't get 2 hang out w/ the usual Jungle Fam... but I did C Sooz who i ain't seen since my Borthday... the ;last timeI went 2 compression... & met some new people.. It was toatlly a fun night thought... good shit man... Loved it!!! =)



Fun Stuff man =)



Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

yea, she's like one of those anomalies in the matrix, too.  she refuses 
to make any sense, or die, either.  buuut she's one of those native san

What is wrong with you?  I mean, he can't say it more plainly.  If you'd
like
to think the sky is green, also, go ahead.  I'm over this, some people just
need
to be right, and at this point I know i'm not one of them so let's let it
lie.

"Well of course it was staged! It's a movie! We built the "bank"
as a set and then I hired actors to play the bank tellers and the manager
and we got a toy gun from the prop department and then I wrote some really

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR Republicans and Democrats -- how different are
 they, really?

Here's the whole quote from
http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/wackoattacko/ :


--
So, how crazy are the things they've said about "Bowling for Columbine?"
Here are my favorites:

    "That scene where you got the gun in the bank was staged!"

Well of course it was staged! It's a movie! We built the "bank" as a set
and then I hired actors to play the bank tellers and the manager and we
got a toy gun from the prop department and then I wrote some really cool
dialogue for me and them to say! Pretty neat, huh?

Or...

The Truth: In the spring of 2001, I saw a real ad in a real newspaper in
Michigan announcing a real promotion that this real bank had where they
would give you a gun (as your up-front interest) for opening up a
Certificate of Deposit account. They promoted this in publications all
over the country . "More Bang for Your Buck!"

There was news coverage of this bank giving away guns, long before I even
shot the scene there. The Chicago Sun Times wrote about how the bank would
"hand you a gun" with the purchase of a CD. Those are the precise words
used by a bank employee in the film.

When you see me going in to the bank and walking out with my new gun in
"Bowling for Columbine" . that is exactly as it happened. Nothing was done
out of the ordinary other than to phone ahead and ask permission to let me
bring a camera in to film me opening up my account. I walked into that
bank in northern Michigan for the first time ever on that day in June
2001, and, with cameras rolling, gave the bank teller $1,000 . and opened
up a 20-year CD account. After you see me filling out the required federal
forms ("How do you spell Caucasian?") . which I am filling out here for
the first time . the bank manager faxed it to the bank's main office for
them to do the background check. The bank is a licensed federal arms
dealer and thus can have guns on the premises and do the instant
background checks (the ATF's Federal Firearms database.which includes all
federally approved gun dealers.lists North Country Bank with Federal
Firearms License #4-38-153-01-5C-39922).

Within 10 minutes, the "OK" came through from the firearms background
check agency and, 5 minutes later, just as you see it in the film, they
handed me a Weatherby Mark V Magnum rifle (If you'd like to see the
outtakes, click here).

And it is that very gun that I still own to this day. I have decided the
best thing to do with this gun is to melt it down into a bust of John
Ashcroft and auction it off on E-Bay (more details on that later). All the
proceeds will go to The Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence to fight
all these lying gun nuts who have attacked my film and make it possible on
a daily basis for America's gun epidemic to rage on.

"All the proceeds will go to The Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence to
fight
all these lying gun nuts who have attacked my film and make it possible on
a daily basis for America's gun epidemic to rage on."

---Or more to the point, the morons who make a movie and call it a
documentary,
don't correct the academy who nominated it as a documentary, or the people
who
watched it believing it to be a documentary.  Or perhaps the idiodic
portrayal of
some bank (that was authorized to do the required background checks) who did
a gun give away and trying to dupe the public, instead of perhaps doing
actual
documentary work at a gun show where it's well known that loop holes allow
for
gun sales that break laws and put guns into the hands of people who
shouldn't (and
are not legally allowed) have them?  Perhaps Mr. Moore would have been
better off
not being a lying sack of shit scumbag.  I rest my case, he's a pile of
shit.  Thank you.

I suggest you go back and read the site- it's clear that he says what
you've quoted here in *jest*.  Even the language used clearly points to
the rediculousness of the accusation.  "We wrote some really cool
dialogue", and "Neat, huh?", right?

Yeah, I guess some people just need to be right- you're absolutely
correct, at least about that.  

Cheeky emoticon.

Yeah, everyone let's show up in mass numbers and show those dumbasses at
Thirsty Bear what they are losing. I didn't think you could get rid of the
Ambient Mafia, I thought they got rid of you....hmmm, sounds like someone
may end up with cement boots in the bay...

Mike, you sounded way toooo much like Ossby. Hello 2Day.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Modern Vernacular for Office & Life

Totally NRR, but this is the funniest stuff I've seen in a while... The
first several may resonate more with corporate drones like myself...

BLAMESTORMING:
Sitting around in a group, discussing why a deadline was missed or a
project failed, and who was responsible.

SEAGULL MANAGER:
A manager who flies in, makes a lot of noise, craps on everything, and
then leaves.

ASSMOSIS:
The process by which some people seem to absorb success and advancement by
kissing up to the boss rather than working hard.

SALMON DAY:
The experience of spending an entire day swimming upstream only to get
screwed and die in the end.

CUBE FARM:
An office filled with cubicles.

PRAIRIE DOGGING:
When someone yells or drops something loudly in a cube farm, and people's
heads pop up over the walls to see what's going on.

MOUSE POTATO:
The on-line, wired generation's answer to the couch potato.

SITCOMS:
Single Income, Two Children, Oppressive Mortgage.What yuppies turn into
when they have children and one of them stops working to stay home with
the kids.

STRESS PUPPY:
A person who seems to thrive on being stressed out and whiney.

SWIPEOUT:
An ATM or credit card that has been rendered useless because the magnetic
strip is worn away from extensive use.

XEROX SUBSIDY:
Euphemism for swiping free photocopies from one's workplace.

IRRITAINMENT:
Entertainment and media spectacles that are annoying but you find yourself
unable to stop watching them. The O.J. trials were a prime example.

PERCUSSIVE MAINTENANCE:
The fine art of whacking the crap out of an electronic device to get it to
work again.

ADMINISPHERE:
The rarefied organizational layers beginning just above the rank and file.
Decisions that fall from the adminisphere are often profoundly
inappropriate or irrelevant to the problems they were designed to solve.

404:
Someone who's clueless. (From the World Wide Web errormessage "404 Not
Found," meaning that the requested document could not be located.)

GENERICA:
Features of the American landscape that are exactly the same no matter
where one is, such as fast food joints, strip malls, subdivisions.

OHNOSECOND:
That minuscule fraction of time in which you realize that you've just made
a BIG mistake.

WOOFYS:
Well Off Older Folks.

CROP DUSTING:
Surreptitiously passing wind while walking thru a cube farm, then enjoying
the sounds of dismay and disgust; leads to PRAIRIEDOGG

Subject: [sfraves] very NRR: Saddam Hussein and "his own people" (not)

hi, just a quick rant about how many people in the media refer to Saddam Hussein using chemical weapons against "his own people." He used them on Kurds, who are not his people. His people are Sunni Muslims and are from the central part of Iraq, whereas the Kurds are in the north (and minority Shiite Muslims are in the central part and the south as well). 

It's as if, say, we had a white supremacist President, and he undertook policies that were outrageously hostile to African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Mexican immigrants, etc. They would not be considered "his people" because he would see them as adversaries. If a homophobic President enacted anti-gay policies, they would not be directed at "his own people" but at his enemies. 

However, it does appear that Saddam Hussein had members of his extended family executed -- sons in law. Those could be considered "his people." And, perhaps he DID use chemical weapons against some Sunni Muslims (his people). 
He claims that it was Iran that used chemical weapons against the Kurds. This is not impossible as Iran borders on the Kurdish part of Iraq. 
Of course, it was the US that armed Saddam Hussein in the 1980s so Iraq could fight Iran, but that's a whole different subject. It was to Israel's benefit that Iraq and Iran were at war, so neither country could go after Israel. 
Who's next in this real game of Risk? Syria? Iran? And thanks to the current regime, soon we'll have the proliferation of "small" nuclear weapons to worry about. 
It's interesting to see how many anti-Bush books are in the NY Times bestseller list. Many people will find Michael Moore, Al Franken, Molly Ivins, and Noam Chomsky books under the Christmas tree this year. 
Dude, where IS my country?

lol Nick. Advent calendars, by definition, go until Christmas. You don't have to read it. I'm sure that after Christmas, Geri will have some other daily entertainment for you to either read or ignore, as is your wont.

And thank you, Andrew and your partner on the keys RFM, for another great 
set!!!!

Yes, Sticky was a tight little underground with a great vibe.  So many 
friends I barely had time to dance.  It was a very pleasant surprise to see 
Becca again after so many months.

One of the memorable moments of the night.  We went upstairs to the 
"naughty" chill room to take in Andy W's ambient set.  Quite a departure 
from what I usually hear him spin, with some good hip hop in the mix.  In 
the middle of his performance someone knocked over a large floor to ceiling 
mirror and the thing broke all over the dance floor near the 
decks.  Shortly after this a fuse blew and Andy's equipment went out.  Then 
a woman engaged us in an animated conversation about 7 years' bad luck for 
the poor guy who smashed the thing.  Ha...who knows.  At that point we went 
downstairs to take in the rest of Adnan's set.

Unfortunately about three or so the neighbors complained about the sound, 
so some of us stood about outside in the garden and talked then agreed to 
go to someone's home for an afterparty with Andan providing the entertainment.

All in all, a good party and happy evening.  Thanks John and the rest of 
the Sticky crew!!!

Much love,

Apollo

I suggest you re-read it.  What he is saying:

A) Yes, it was all stagged, but....
B) It was stagged based upon a real fact (i.e. that bank that did the gun
promotion)

So he's admitting the stagging, which goes against the grain of a
documentary, plus
butchers it a bit (his stagged scene isn't exactly as it would have happened
at that
real life bank that does background checks), and then lets his movie be
portrayed as
a documentary lol.  Look at the way the scene is shot, bad camera work and
lighting,
as if it was just "spur of the moment".  Right, whatever.

Apparently I am absolutely correct about it, see below.

> hi, just a quick rant about how many people in the media refer to Saddam
Hussein using chemical weapons against "his own people." He used them on
Kurds, who are not his people. His people are Sunni Muslims and are from the
central part of Iraq, whereas the Kurds are in the north (and minority
Shiite Muslims are in the central part and the south as well).

Actually the Shite are the majority.  Now ya know.  ANd when the media use a
term like "his own people" let's not get semantic and not understand that is
what is meant is "the Iraqi people", of which Kurds indeed are.

> It's as if, say, we had a white supremacist President, and he undertook
policies that were outrageously hostile to African-Americans,
Asian-Americans, Mexican immigrants, etc. They would not be considered "his
people" because he would see them as adversaries. If a homophobic President
enacted anti-gay policies, they would not be directed at "his own people"
but at his enemies.
>
> However, it does appear that Saddam Hussein had members of his extended
family executed -- sons in law. Those could be considered "his people." And,
perhaps he DID use chemical weapons against some Sunni Muslims (his people).

He did execute members of his family, tens of thousands of Shite, don't know
how many Sunni, and did use (not perhaps did use) chemical weapons to kill
about 470,000 Kurds.  These facts stand alone, regardless of our actions now
in Iraq, why we went, and the rest.

> He claims that it was Iran that used chemical weapons against the Kurds.
This is not impossible as Iran borders on the Kurdish part of Iraq.
> Of course, it was the US that armed Saddam Hussein in the 1980s so Iraq
could fight Iran, but that's a whole different subject. It was to Israel's
benefit that Iraq and Iran were at war, so neither country could go after
Israel.

The Kurds would disagree with you, and if Chemical Ali (God rest his sole)
could speak, i'm sure he'd correct you're attempt to place the blame
elsewhere.  Please don't forget that it was Iraq that invaded Iran.  Iran
doesn't give a rats about Israel, so let's not jump to any unnecessary
conclusions.  Again, Iraq invaded Iran, and the Iranians are Persians first
and could give a toss about Jews.

It's not Sadaams fault, it's not Clinton's either.  It's Bush and those
damned Jews!   Of course all the loose nuclear material and missle
technology (Silkworm mean anything to you?) is Bush's fault and all from the
U.S.  Of course!   Guess all those books in the best seller list just prove
the media is liberal and has brainwashed most of the masses.  It's hilarious
when the masses think they're brainwashed by those not doing the washing =P
Ya gotta laugh about it eh?

Another VERY interesting book was penned by Brzezinski (1st Director
of the Trilater Commission (in '73), the Advisor to the President on
National Security Affairs during the Carter Administration, a member
of the President's Chemical Warfare Commission under Reagan, as well as
a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board under
Reagan and Bush 1.
http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/brzezinski/ and
http://speakers.com/zbrzezinski.html) in '97 called "The Grand
Chessboard: American Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives" which
outlines a strategy that we seem to be following AWFULLY closely.  Check
it out if you get a chance.  Maybe you can place some bets in Vegas and
make some cash.

-- 
"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President or
that we are to stand by the President right or wrong is not only
unpatriotic and servile but it is morally treasonable to the
American public."

-Theodore Roosevelt, 1918

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

The revolution came and they blew it, made a hole three centuries deep and
filled it.
They swept in all the streets, all the freaks and all the finest.  Now we're
wading,
we're knee-deep, and I can't tell you what the time is because the nearest
clock is
ten miles up and I am too short-sighted, but that's life.  Now there's four

Yeah- watch out for them muffins!  I skarfed one after our set and was
seriously zonked.  Anyway, Delaney and I (dj2 to those who don't know)
had an awesome time playing- the support was really, really
appreciated.

This was definitely one of those parties where I saw many great friends
I have not seen in forever and had a wonderful, chill time.

Kudos to all involved,
Love y'all,
George of dj2

Oh my god, those muffins were delicious!
I was pigging out on one, pretty hungry actually, when Justin Hale walked up
to me (early in the evening) and said, be careful! (hehehe there was already
a warning message posted nearby)

But it was too late! So I was also a stoner. What fun. Thanks for the
memories and for the muffins disguised as cupcakes.

i had a great time as well - unfortunately, near the end of my
set i was so spaced out by the muffins that i forgot that i was
actually spinning at the party.  pretty stoney.

unfortunate about the mirror and the party getting shut down
early - good thing no one was hurt.  much props for a party
well done!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: Sticky!

about the power: someone bumped the cord accross the room... that took about 2min to trace back and
plug back in.

about the mirror: yes, it took the nestea plunge, landing about a 2 feet from my left foot.  funny
thing is that not a single person was near it.  after it was cleaned up (which seemed about 30
seconds) i went and looked at the wall and found that the 4 dinky screws that were weakly screwed
into the bare wallboard had vibrated clean off (due to Andy's dropping a track off Face Value
moments earlier no doubt ;)

at any rate, the mirror had one too many muffins on it's own :)

s t i c k y : gawdamn, i say gawdamn-g a w d a m n - had needed one of those for a while now

Subject: [sfraves] Thank You from STICKY!

We just want to say thanks to everyone who made it out to STICKY! on 
Saturday. What an incredible Christmas get down! Everyone who came brought 
their Christmas cheer and energy and the place was filledl with smiles and 
fun! From the decorations to the visuals to the sound in both rooms to the 
bar to the kitchen to the rainy fire garden, this place was decked and ready 
for action! Thanks to all the cast and crew, you guys rawked and put on a 
fantastic show!

If anyone has any pictures or reviews (especially from other lists I’m 
probably not on), could you please forward them to me? We’re making memory 
albums from each of the Sticky! parties.. Thanks.

Some of our personal highlights.. feel free to share yours…
Ryan covering himself in beer while fixing the jockey box.
Diane’s plastic cup Christmas light decorations.
The "fireplace" dj booth complete with hung stockings.
Watermelon jello-shots.
Putting out the fire pit in the garden because the storm winds were blowing 
hot coals toward the house.
Long Islands and Vodka Crans.
DJ2’s killer live set to a packed house.
Those potent blueberry and chocolate muffins.
Pop Pop’s secret eggnog recipe.
The easy-up blowing off the front entrance.
Boomerang Fidget’s intellectual rap session during his set.
Was that HOT cheese on the nachos? Who licked that bowl clean?
Muppet visuals.
Pucker shots.
The full size mirror that fell and broke into a million pieces right in 
front of the venue owner as we were negotiating why we needed to shut down 
and how late we could actually go.
Adnan rocking the joint something fierce.
And last but certainly not least, the 1001 compliments we got on the party 
during the course of the night.. Even when I had to shut Science down after 
only half a record, you were all extremely courteous and stayed until the 
wee hours to help clean up and finish the liquor! I didn’t feel any 
negativity at all the entire night from anyone.

Thank you and Merry Christmas. I know ours is already made.

See you in April,
The Sticky Family.

Subject: [sfraves] Gay Marriage poll, please take!!!

To all who are family, love family, or support equal rights for all human 
beings:

The American Family Association is doing a poll on gay marriage, which they 
are going to present the results of to Congress. Please pass this URL far 
and wide.

They give three options.  In favor, not in favor and in favor of civil union 
with all the privileges but not the name "marriage".  Let's make our Voice 
heard and initiate a positive change to the world in which our children will 
grow up!

http://www.afa.net/petitions/marriagepoll.asp

Only good can come of a unified effort, made in love!

Blessed Be.

Dude, the world is finally ready to accept Phil Collins' cover version of
"Tomorrow Never Knows" and you're complaining about it.  Sheesh!

The history of that track is an amazing journey.

unknown date
Tibetan Book of the Dead (a poetic commentary on the nature of life,
death, and life after death) is written after Buddhism comes to Tibet.

1926
Tibetan Book of the Dead (Bardo Thodol) is translated to English.
Edited by Walter Y. Evans-Wentz and translated by Kazi Dawa Samdup

1964
Timothy Leary bases his "Psychedelic Experience" on this translation, and
tributes the book to Carl Jung, the translator and editor of the original,
and dedicates it to Aldous Huxley who really introduced Western pop
society to the trip in the Doors of Perception and passed away during the
writing of the Leary book.  As an aside, Richard Alpert (now Ram Dass), a
buddy of Leary's wrote "Be Here Now" which is supposed to be a prelude to
this book but really beats the shit out of it like 900 fold and stands
much better on it's own.  The writings of Leary, Huxley, and the Beats
(Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, etc) fuel a popular movement that changes
the very fabric of American culture and late 20th century art leading to a
massive leftward lean (including a redefinition of gender roles, societal
mores, understanding of drugs, anti corporate and government sentiments)
from upper and middle class youth and hipster society.  While not a
popularly accepted theory, many Eastern Europeans and citizens of the
former USSR credit the popular music of that time as the single most
appealling and pervasive instrument in swaying opinion of America (and by
inference the west in general) as a true land of freedom rather than
believing the propaganda of their countrymen (notable persons to have said
this include Vaclav Havel and my father who emigrated here in the late
60s).

1966
Beatles quote passages from the book extensively including most of the
"Tomorrow Never Knows" (from Revolver).  Beatles provide the audio for the
above revolution along with sonic pioneers Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson
Airplane, Grateful Dead, and front runners of the folk and outside jazz
movements.

February 1981
Phil Collins, ever imitating the artistic direction of former Genesis
bandmate Peter Gabriel with a pop spin follows the introspective tone of
the First couple self titled Peter Gabriel LPs with "Face Value".

December 2003
AndyW, ever on a mission to undermine white soul poseurs Phil Collins,
Robert Plant and Eric Clapton for the sorry derivative fucks they are
plays Phil Collins' version of "tomorrow never knows" for a room partially
full of people already annoyed with his sad attempts at hip hop and social
commentary using vinyl as a carrier.  Somehow feeling this is horribly
wrong and knowing it, Andy is shaken by the glass falling... almost as if
in response to his demonstration of how far a message can be twisted by
sad white nerds like Leary, Collins and ultimately himself.

I've actually met Timothy Leary and he's a stellar guy (RIP), just not too
fond of his writings and never quite understood why he'll be remembered as
the catalyst for the cerebral aspects of the 60s at the expense of Huxley,
Kesey, etc.  I haven't met Phil Collins but he wrote Sussudio and for that
I will never forgive him.

In any case, I had buckets of fun at Sticky... and while this mail might
have been tangential, it's not the worst.

:)

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: ISO older DJ Dan mixes...

A friend of mine on the East Coast is trying to track down a few DJ Dan 
mixes, and I figured I'd hit up you folk 1st to see if you might have 'em, 
and if I can get copies somehow...

Here're the names (to the best of my ability):

Live @ Funky Tekno Tribe

Live @ Tree

Live @ Syrous

All are probably recorded somewhere between '94 - '97.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!!

hello, this is your holiday ravers advent calender...adventure for the unventurous...there's no larry flynt here folks, but we can all dream, can't we..."so, after several sets of choice music...meaning, actual well mixed house, trance of vurtually all styles, except for the ones that are played much to fast, but too fast isn't a style, too fast is lame, the young and extraordinarily talented couple decided to chill for a spell with their friends who they are actually able to engage in conversation with without feeling or being insulted...you see, this is a special group of raver friends, much like ones we all know, who know that if they don't feel so hot, it actually has something to do with physical conditions rather than some sort of floating fantasy....oh, and there were candy canes for all on the ship of bananas...hot weather too..."...more later...:)

Subject: [sfraves] Support EQUAL Federal Marriage Laws!

Hello Everyone,

I am appalled at what i've just found on the below mentioned site. Maybe 
it's my own naivety, but I didn't realize that anti-homosexual activists 
actually rallied together on websites to *write to our congress-folk* 
against the very causes which would bring us equality. well, i've revised 
one pre-written letter i found on this site, and pasted it below. please, i 
urge you, visit this site, and email in your letter supporting hetero- and 
homo-sexual federal marriage (feel free to use my letter, or better yet to 
speak your own words against a Federal Marriage Amendment). i think it's a 
beautiful thing to use the very tool meant by our opposition to separate us, 
as a tool to speak our voice. For those of you that I wrote to earlier, 
regarding the poll, thanks so much for your responses. It brightened my 
heart today to see the poll numbers change from 82% against and 13% for, to 
74% against and 21% for, in a matter of a few hours. Please, take this extra 
step to make an even bigger impact, and encourage anyone you know who 
supports equality to do the same.


http://capwiz.com/afanet/alert4171001.html

The Supreme Court of Massachusetts has ruled that homosexual marriage is now 
legal in that state. This means, according the the "full faith and credit" 
clause in the U.S. Constitution, marriage between homosexuals may be 
accepted in all 50 states.

I am writing today to express my support of homosexual marriage. I plea that 
you vote against a Federal Marriage Amendment that would limit the 
definition of marriage to between a man and woman only.

The future of democracy, equality and human and societal progress is at 
stake if this amendment should pass!

Please let me know if you are AGAINST a Federal Marriage Amendment.


In love and light and for the future for all of us who don't fit into 
america's ideal family structure.

Blessed Be.

Subject: [sfraves] new mix: The Control Structure

I swear, I haven't been living in a hole (musically, at least) since the
release of my last mix, "Even Deeper". I've just been slowly amassing a
collection of vinyl so devastatingly good that soon, no tech-house DJ in
the bay area will be able to stop me!

Those of you who enjoyed my closing set at Harvest are in for a treat.
Blurring the lines between house and techno, this mix is deep, dark, and
painstakingly mixed for your pleasure. It's certainly been a long time
coming. Download and enjoy:

<http://alterior.net/audio/shazbot-the_control_structure.mp3>

Featuring:

01. Jeff Samuel - Gbbbump [Karloff]
02. Maetrik - tns-3 (feat. ill73) [Morris Audio Citysport Edition]
03. Mike Shannon - Shogun [Pacific Technics]
04. Rarefaktion - Disto [Click Tracks]
05. Stereofuse - Hot Slot [Salo]
06. Jeremy P. Caulfield - Drowning [Trapez]
07. Billy Delessandro - Mister Sinister [X Force Inc.]
08. Misc. - Fruhling In Beton [Sender]
09. Oliver Hacke - Clip Zwei [Trapez]
10. Joshua Collins - Reform (Rachael Starr Mix) [Honchos]
11. Nathan Fake - Outhouse (Beaty Tool Mix) [Border Community]
12. Smithmonger - Little Sunmonger [Oblong]
13. Maetrik - Freaky Flow (Random Factor Point to Point Mix) [Big Chief]
14. Lusine - Push [Ghostly International]

I'm burning CD's of this one, so give it a listen and shoot me an email
with your address if you'd like a tracked disc with a shiny label sent
to your door. Constructive criticism of mixing and track selection is
welcome, too :)

Cheers,

I would strongly recommend against giving the AFA your email address AND
filling out a survey that you are against gay marriage on the same frikkin
page.  Or giving any credence whatsoever to this shit.

Don't give these fucktards your email address and city and state and
opinion.  It's like registering with the Nazis... don't give them anything
to abuse.

I mean, look at this shit:
http://www.afajournal.org/2003/novdec/111203sodom.asp

Your congresspeople KNOW what the numbers are from less biased surveys.

If you really want change, stuff those ballots with fake emails and fake
contacts info that are PRO their stupid agenda, so the GOP and the
Religious Reich will have "guts" to take their homophobic agenda public
(did you know the GOP won't even let the Log Cabins (aka gay Republicans)
on the floor of many official functions as a group) and we can actually
vote on some real issues next election instead of soft stances everywhere.

I know it sucks, I know it seems like we're not a day past 1965 in terms
of tolerance sometimes, but fer chrissakes work smart not hard.

Hey everyone

I have a question.  I'm rather stumped by it.  I have a laptop that =
doesn't have a linein.  Just a mic and headphone jack.  I have a sony =
vaio grx570 laptop.  Anyway I was wondering if there was a usb device or =
something available that automatically does a linein?  I don't want a =
whole soundblaster unit for my laptop that costs 100$ so i was wondering =
if any of you guys had any advice on the situation.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Support EQUAL Federal Marriage Laws!

This does bring up an intresting, if tangential, thought....

No doubt the republicans were all beside themselves, and just bursting 
with hate and outrage, when the Supreme Court (just the week or so 
before Pride this year, no less) slapped down those texans and their 
*local* anti-homosexuality laws.  But Massachusetts' supreme court sure 
seems to kicked over the anthill.  Since this morning, we've got a 
sitting president openly saying, to just about any member of the press 
who'll listen, that he'll support amending the constitution to redefine 
gays as second-class citizens, circumventing the advances in human 
rights that have been forced through the courts so far.

So.... if he and the rest of his despicable little christian buddies 
succeed... if the constitution... if the supreme "law of the land" is 
successfully changed; so as to take away basic human rights rights (or 
prevent them from ever being attained), and make sure that it is 
acceptable to treat a minority of ten percent (If you believe Kinsey's 
numbers) or more (My own guess, just based on the number of gay or bi 
vs. straight people I know) of the population as sub-human beasts...

... would gay USians qualify for aslyum or refugee status in one of the 
more civilized nations of the world?  Even before this latest 
maleficence, I've been thinking, for quite a while, that an extended 
relocation to... say... Vancouver or Toronto would be a welcome relief 
from the downward spiral the US seems to be taking.  This latest just 
increases my desire to get off this ride, by any means necessary, even 
more.


cya,

Yeah, there's no gay christians and republicans, so clearly any roadblock to
your goal is their fault /sarcasm.  Your own hate betrays you, young JohnB

you can use the mic input on the laptop just like a line-in. it's got an
auto gain on it or it should... yeah you could buy a usb external input but
that's really for those that don't have any form of input like the iBooks
and some of the TiBooks. Otherwise use what you have built in.

I was just looking around hyperreal.org and I saw that sac, SF, Fresno, and 
So-Cal all got there own little list set up. But out of all of them witch one 
is the best? 


my finger is pointing towards sfraves@hyperreal.org Just because they are not 
about to much drama such as sacraves/sacdrama list. 


But is there more list to sing up on for north California? I would like to 
check out most of the list for my self just to see how they are.

well thanks a bunch 

Is there outer e-list sites besides hyperreal.org? If anyone knows please let 
me in thanks.

here's a few of mine...

	www.cinderblock.com/new/demo 2_7_02.mp3
	www.cinderblock.com/new/Live_at_FNF_2003.mp3
	www.cinderblock.com/new/lunar_moment_live.mp3
	www.cinderblock.com/new/sunday_morning_bliss.mp3


"Lunar Moment live" is probably my favorite of the bunch. it's from my 
set at Mercey Hot Springs.
"Live at Friends & Family 2003" is my 6 am morning breaks set, very 
similar to "Sunday Morning Bliss", which was a giveaway for peeps 
driving home from Camp & Sons last summer, just to keep that afterglow 
burning...

enjoy!  feedback always appreciated.

Oh and I also want to add Anton Styles to this list... Another excellent
breaks DJ that you have to hear...

http://www.viberation.com/ryan/mp3/anton_styles/ - state of emergency and
malfunction are breaks mixes. the other is techno. on state of emergency
note that he does a lot of layering and mixes in samples that aren't part of
the records. it's good shit. too bad not many people know him...

2 sets from Science. Filthy Needle Breaks is from last Fall. Excellent
breaks CD. The other is from when he played Ascension when Viberation hosted
one night. More on the 2-Step side of things. Still excellent. I have 2
other sets laying around that aren't online.

Whats up peoples. Fonetic is going down tonight in San Jose once again, and will be the last one for the year. Hopefully some of you guys and girls will make it out tonight. I will be playing the early slot tonight along with residents dj's Cronos, Less Carter, and a special guest.
 
 Again this is the last one for the year so it would be great to see some of you out there and to end the year with a bang!
 
Fonetic is for the 21plus and is located at Cabana at 396 S. First street in downtown San Jose.
 
 Hope to see some of you on the dancefloor!

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the

visible."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] what is the best e-list to be on? www.hyperreal.org (RAVES?)
 California

There are a lot of lists in California.  Some of them are underground lists 
and you have to be invited in order to join.  You may want to check out some 
of the forums that are popular (aka above ground or whatever).  Bayraves.com 
is a good place to start.  I kill countless hours at work browsing the 
ridiculous threads, downloading posted mixs, and telling people how 
intelligent they are ;)  Another one you may want to check out is 
Deciblast.org.  It's a bit smaller than bayraves but has the same shit and 
some other features as well.  There is also ravesf and some others.  I hope 
that helps a bit.
-Joey

It's rare, but I think you actually said something I can comprehend and

Ah yes... google is my friend...  So easy to hunt down obscure

Well, the christians wrote into their "holy" book, as a tenets of their 
ideology, things like Leviticus 20:13:

http://www.godhatesfags.com/main/faq.html#God's_hate

... which says that gays are abominations, and must be killed.  So 
while it's possible, on paper, for a gay or bi person to *technically* 
be a christian, (After all, you can't help it if your parents had you 
baptized, and The Church never actually got around to excommunicating 
you.), in practice, it makes about as much sense as a jewish nazi, or a 
religious socialist, a black klansman, and the like.

Likewise with the republican party:

http://www.rnc.org/GOPInfo/Platform/2000platform4.htm

They have written into their platform and ideology the tenet that gays 
do not deserve the same rights as other humans, and their support for 
legislation (And, now, an constitutional amendment) establishing as 
much; effective making them second-class, sub-human, non-citizens in 
the eyes of the GOP.  In addition, a major plank in their platform is a 
strong support for "religion".  And while they are not so un-PC as to 
outright *SAY* that ("religion" == christianity), the implication is 
pretty obvious from public statements of the party leadership.  So 
while it's possible, on paper, for a gay or bi person to *technically* 
be a republican  (Hell, ANYONE can hump it down to the Post Office, get 
a new voter-registration card, check that little box next to the word 
"Republican", and send it in.), in practice, it makes about as much 
sense as... well... a jewish nazi, or a religious socialist, a black 
klansman, and the like.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: Support EQUAL Federal Marriage Laws!

John,

Your hatred is an abomination.  Leviticus is part of the OLD 
TESTAMENT.  The OLD TESTAMENT was written BEFORE Christ.  Christianity is 
based on Christ, which is the gospels; the NEW TESTAMENT.  Judaism is based 
on the OLD TESTAMENT alone!  <sarcasm>Please hate on the jews equally! 
</sarcasm>

Personally, I'm all for civil unions, and against gay marriage.  Marriage 
is a specific religious term that means the union of a man and woman for 
procreation.  I think the term "marriage" should be wiped off the books 
entirely; it's NOT a secular term.  So I agree with RNC's:

"We support the traditional definition of "marriage" as the legal union of 
one man and one woman, and we believe that federal judges and bureaucrats 
should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages."

However, this is pretty damning: (again, from RNC)

"For the same reason, we do not believe sexual preference should be given 
special legal protection or standing in law."

The belief that homosexuality is a choice is far outdated.. I don't know of 
anyone under 70 that thinks like that.  I'm all for equal rights.. but gays 
have no more right to marriage than I do to a ba-mitzvah.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: Support EQUAL Federal Marriage Laws!

The church and christians are increasingly two different things.  But the
lack
of an ordained marriage for gays is just the way it's gonna be, that's how
the
book is written and unfortunately not likely to be looked over in that
regard.
But what does that matter?  A marriage that's not religiously approved is a
marriage nontheless.

As to republicans, what is said is this, and the rest of your rant is just
so much
banter:  "For the same reason, we do not believe sexual preference should
be given special legal protection or standing in law."  All this effectively
says is
gay marriage will not be tolerated.  That's it.  There is nothing more or
less
here, though you may wish there to be.  I disagree that gay marriage
(legally,
not religiously) should be against the law.  But i'm not overly upset about
the
way things are now, either.  A) I'm not gay.  B) What are we talking about?
Tax issues and the like?  You tell me.  I think it's dumb to be illegal, but
otoh
I don't see why you have to shout fire because someone lit a match in the
bathroom.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Leviticus / Gay Christians

While I have the bible out, I thought I'd note some of the other rules from 
Leviticus 20.  paraphrased.

Anyone that worships Molech should be stoned to death by the community.
God rejects anyone that worships Molech.
If the community ignores someone worshipping Molech, God rejects the community.
If anyone goes to a seance, they are no longer in God's family.
Anyone who curses their mother or father shall be put to death.
If you commit Adultery, both Adulterers must die.
If you fuck your dad's wife, you and the wife die (stepmom sex?)
Father fucks daughter in-law.  Both die.
If a man marries a woman and her mother, all three shall be BURNED to death.
Bestiality = death to man & beast.
Incest = driven from the community.
and it goes on..

When was the last time you saw a community burn some people to death?  The 
old testament is known for fire and brimstone.  The God of the OT is an 
angry and wrathful God.  Chances are you can find a passage or two to 
support any extreme viewpoint.  The New Testament is about LOVE for your 
fellow man.  Christ forgave the "bad people" that the Jew's cast out of 
their temples.

I ain't no bible study person..nor very religious in such things..but if you
are taking this from the bible.. didn't the bible also say that jesus died
for our sins.  Doesn't it also say that most of the 10 commandments boil
down to the golden rule?  Simple answer since I don't want to get caught up
in this.  Just wanted to add a penny or two.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Leviticus/Gay Christians (NRR)

	An amusing Biblical fact is that Lot had incest with both of his 
daughters -- they get him drunk and fuck him in order to become 
pregnant, as supposedly they can't find anyone else to bear his 
children and ensure the continuation of his line. This was the family 
that God saved when he decided to murder everyone else in Sodom and 
Gomorrah for wickedness (including Lot's wife, who made the mistake of 
looking over her shoulder when they were leaving). To the Christian 
God, having incest is evidently preferable to being a witness to God's 
destruction of a couple cities full of people. (This is all from 
Genesis Chapter 19.)

	So it's really pretty hard for me to take what the Bible may say about 
sexual relations seriously. And of course the notion of "marriage" 
being "between a man and a woman" is largely based on this 
Judeo-Christian tradition. There's nothing that says a different 
cultural or religious tradition can't be started now (or hasn't already 
been started) that includes the concept of two or more people of the 
same gender coming together and calling it marriage. Christians don't 
own this word any more than they own the word "Christmas" or have the 
right to require that people celebrating the holiday must focus on 
Jesus and not Santa Claus.

wow today i was shopping around for Christmas gifts and you would never guess 
what i had to buy my self. i was in the video game section of Walmart just 
picking up some cheap gifts when i was walking buy the electronics sections. 

so like every guy i had to stop and give my self some eye candy. i had to 
touch and pick up all the cool things they had on display but i walked over to 
the gaming section and saw this game called "True Crimes Streets Of LA" i asked 
someone to get it out of the casing so i could look at it. wow there is mass 
killing and car jacking in this game. also you drive 26o square feet of LA. 
just to shoot and jack cars. but there is more to this game there is some store 
line but i have not gotten far on it yet. 


So I was just passing the word about how this game kicks ass. 

The graphics on it are dope I mean I have a Nintendo Game Cube and it looks 
like a xbox :-) there sweet and I love all the guns you get also how you 
upgrade your style of shooting and fighting RPG style. 

This is a must have game if you are a fan of GTA-GTA3 it is just so much 
better. There is this night club scene or building you get to go into in downtown 
Hollywood and they are playing a Techno song by Bad Boy Bill.


Well, anyway take care.

State firefighters rejected air drop request for Cedar Fire because of =20=

night regulations

(10-30) 23:43 PST   SAN DIEGO (AP) --

The first helicopter pilot to see the patch of flames that would become =20=

the catastrophic Cedar Fire radioed for aerial water drops, but state =20=

firefighters rejected his request because it came minutes after such =20
flights had been grounded for the night.

Within hours, the flames cascaded out of control and killed 13 =20
residents between the mountains east of San Diego and the city. It =20
eventually became the largest wildfire in California history.

Southern California was already besieged by flames Saturday evening =20
when the San Diego County Sheriff's helicopter went to search for a =20
lost hunter who allegedly lit a beacon fire.

Pilot Dave Weldon told The Associated Press on Thursday that he saw =20
state firefighting planes on a nearby airstrip as he approached the =20
mountains at 110 mph. He called down for help because his dispatcher =20
had relayed reports of smoke in the area, but he got no response.

That was around 5:45 p.m. A few minutes later, he spotted smoke from =20
the fire, then only about 50 yards on each side and not spreading.

As he steadied his helicopter against wind gusts, Weldon's concern =20
mounted. Just before landing, he called for backup, asking another =20
county helicopter to speed to the scene with its 120-gallon water dump =20=

bucket. And he urged the dispatcher to contact state firefighters and =20=

renew his request for air tankers.

The problem was that under state safety guidelines, no flights can go =20=

up into waning daylight. On Saturday, the cutoff was 5:36 p.m., said =20
California Department of Forestry Capt. Ron Serabia, who coordinates =20
the 12 tankers and 10 helicopters now battling the 272,000-acre blaze.

The sun set that day at 6:05 p.m.

The helicopter with the dump bucket flew within five miles of the fire, =20=

before state officials told it to turn back, Weldon said. The air =20
tankers never took off. Weldon was told crews would attack the fire in =20=

the morning.

"We were basically just offering our assistance fighting their fire, =20
and they turned it down," said Weldon, who with his partner delivered =20=

the hunter to law enforcement officials who cited him for setting an =20
unauthorized fire. "I was frustrated about it, but I wasn't surprised."

Weldon said the county helicopter wouldn't have been allowed to drop =20
water after dark and said that it alone couldn't have done the job, but =20=

he thought a well-placed drop from the air tanker might have =20
extinguished the flames.

On Thursday, California's top fire official said he was not aware of =20
the events and cited state night-flight restrictions.

"If the air tankers and helicopters cannot safely fly based on =20
daylight, they cannot respond," said Ray Snodgrass, chief deputy =20
director of the CDF. "We certainly don't want to kill any pilots."

The call from the county dispatcher came minutes after pilots had left =20=

the airstrip in Ramona for the night, Serabia said.

Serabia was off Saturday, but said that if word had arrived sooner, a =20=

plane could have dropped 3,200 gallons of chemical retardant within =20
eight minutes. What's more, pilots might have slipped in a second =20
flight because once a plane is engaged, it can fly up to 30 minutes =20
after cutoff.

"The aircraft would have been able to suppress the fire, or at least =20
hold it in check," Serabia said.

Still, he said hindsight was pointless.

"It's easy to say 'What if we did this,' or 'What if we did that,"' =20
said Serabia, a 35-year veteran firefighter. "I'm not going to =20
second-guess it. That's what we have to live with -- what happened, =20
what transpired from that point after cutoff."

The rules may help save pilots, but they were cold comfort to the son =20=

THE AGONY OF ECSTACY

Those 20,000-strong mega-raves at the Orange Show Fairgrounds in San
Bernardino are no more.  Big downtown events are fewer and farther
between.

Superstar DJs are finding fewer and fewer gigs on the rave circuit.  And
fans of euphoric trance and emotional ecstasy are relegated to a handful
of smaller, legit venues, places such as Pomona's Glass House, downtown
L.A.'s Orion, and Qtopia in Hollywood.  Not like it was.

At Qtopia, for example, raving is still alive but not so well.  The
promise of techno-hippie pastures filled with hugs and uplifting tunes has
given way to kids crashed out on the dirty concrete and vibing to
infantile trance.  On a recent Saturday night at the club, all the
trappings of e-culture are in evidence, but little of the original uplift.
Green lasers pierce man-made fog as ravers begin hitting the ground with
ecstasy-induced fatigue.  Pot smoke clouds a concrete patio outside,
nearly every single inch of which is covered in graffiti art.  Cholos,
skaters, and club kids bounce to the sound.

Dancers are in overdrive, but the vibe is one of a culture being driven
posed to the thousands who would attend raves in the '90s.  There are
strange sightings on the dance floor.  A girl holds her face in her hands,
crying.Asian-American girls hold up a wall, pointing and giggling.  Go-go
girls in club-kid platforms and super-small boyshorts dance in front of a
stack of eight speakers that let out an aural assault, but are later
thrown out of the club, apparently for being too provocative.  Rave toys
of the sort once listed by the federal government as drug paraphernalia -
blinking red pacifiers, glow-in-the-dark necklaces - are sold at two
stands.  The party's logo, an anime-style Michelin Man sendup, is depicted
on banners in Day-Glo colors.  In each image, he holds a Popsicle.

Authorities from the federal government to the San Bernardino County
Supervisors have cracked down on ecstasy and raves.  ( In San Berdoo, you
can't have a party of 200 without a permission slip from the county.  )
Venue owners are afraid to host events, and researchers have unleashed
dire, if not always accurate, information about ecstasy, once the drug of
choice.  But the agony of ecstasy may be to blame for the decline of rave
culture, especially in a Southern California scene once known as the
country's e-culture capital.

The drug produces inner warmth and familial buzz, a feeling pop culture
journalist Simon Reynolds described as "an oozy yearn, a bliss-ache."

But frequent users often fall into a hole of depression and despair.  The
lucky ones drop out of the scene.  The hardcore graduates move on to
ketamine, GHB, and speed.  Ecstasy's natural five-year cycle puts the rave
scene on a roller coaster, chewing up new converts and spitting them out
when they've hit bottom.  With its deep depression, isolation, and wild
psychological swings - not to mention the potential effects on jobs,
family, and friends - ecstasy can be a long, dark, and lonely road.  Last
year's decline, after skyrocketing increases in ecstasy use in America,
suggests that ravers have had enough.

Annual emergency-room visits for ecstasy users ages 20 to 25 declined by
39 percent last year, according to the federal Substance Abuse & Mental
Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ).  Total e-related visits to the
E.R.  peaked in 2001, but then dipped the next year.  Ecstasy use had seen
a steady, steep rise, with a peak of more than two million new users in
2001.  But last year saw its first decline since 1993, according to
SAMHSA.  The percentage of high school seniors who had tried ecstasy also
dipped last year after peaking out at more than 9 percent in 2002.  With
such tools as the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act and the federally
funded Partnership for a Drug-Free America's television commercial
campaign, the authorities and politicians are taking some credit for the
decline.

"I think those campaigns do make a difference," says Trinka D.  Porrata, a
former Los Angeles police narcotics detective who has become an authority
on ecstasy culture.  But she says the kids' own experiences are the
biggest influence.  "People either get totally screwed up on drugs and
spiral down completely or they get off of it.  There are kids out there
who aren't totally stupid - rational kids who say, "Wait a minute, it
could happen to me."

While the government has been warning youth - wrongly so, according to the
recent retraction of federally funded research - that ecstasy causes brain
damage, and pro-psychedelia cheerleaders have been touting the so-called
therapeutic benefits of the drug, the young unbelievers will continue with
their own personal research until they come to their own conclusions.
This year, their thumbs-down has led to e-culture exodus.

"It's a cycle - people are fucked up or they see their friends are fucked
up, so they chill out," says one longtime Southern California scene
observer who promoted his own raves at the dawn of the '90s.  "A couple
years down the line, you're naturally going to have a decline."

Everyone has their theories about the decline of raves and ecstasy use.
Rick Doblin, the Harvard-trained Ph.D.  ecstasy public policy expert and a
proponent of the drug, thinks the feds' campaign against the drug and
against raves has indeed had some impact.  "There has been this major
federal anti-rave act," he says.  "I do think the ways in which they have
intimidated promoters has had a chilling effect on free speech and
expression."

Word on the street, however, is oblivious to the crackdown.

"I stopped taking ecstasy because a lot of people started dropping dead
from that shit," said 16-year-old Kai as she tried to get into the party
at Qtopia recently.  "I went to rehab over it."

Clubbin'

Outside the club, 23-year-old Shaun has E for sale, at an all-time low of
$15 a pill.  The ecstasy boom of late has produced a glut of pills, some
manufactured stateside in places like the East Bay, and much of the rest
imported from the Netherlands.  It's more available than ever, even if the
market has thinned out to club nights like this one which draw only a few
hundred dancers.

"You still have massives and undergrounds," Shaun says, "but now it's all
about the clubs."

Shaun says the crackdown of late has made things a little more
uncomfortable, and he stays on his toes.  Gone are the days of "X"
baseball caps and "ecstasy" T-shirts for dealers.  He wears a
glow-in-the-dark plastic bracelet.  "If you wear bracelets like this, or a
pacifier, the cops will pull you outside the club," he says.

Still, business is not bad, and Shaun says he's a smart salesman.

"When I first come to a party, I sell them for $15, undercutting every
other dealer," he says.  "Then at the end, when people are jonesing, I
charge $20.  I walk out of a party making $500 a night."

Inside, a girl who looks not much older than 16 circles the main room
again and again, advertising "X - X." Stopped by a stranger, she looks
alarmed, positively busted, her face flush with guilt.  After being
assured there are no narcs within earshot, she admits business hasn't been
too good for her $20-a-pill enterprise.  Wearing a red sweatshirt and
beige denim pants, she says she's 18, the minimum age for admittance.

"A lot of people are getting out of the scene," she says.  "I think it's
because a lot of the ecstasy is bad."

The DJs - older scene veterans including Mars and Thee-o - spin the same
three-chord trance that's been in favor at raves for the last five years.
Dreadlocked Mars gets on the turntables and rinses out a
140-beats-per-minute version of 'O Fortuna' - a rave hit under its
techno-version guise a decade ago - and the crowd goes wild, hands in the
air.

The party's promoter, Jason Sperling, says the scene has indeed fallen on
hard times.  His Skills crew does big events in the Bay Area, and he
claims to have had 9,000 customers at his last rave.  The federal
government's focus on raves has made club proprietors reluctant to risk
their businesses on rave-like events.  Rave is a dirty word.

"Our problem is venues,"4 Sperling says.  "Everything ends at 2 a.m.  Not
too many venues will let us do these late-night shows.  They don't want
too many young kids gathering.  The scene is slowly moving into legitimate
clubs, but it's slow because not everyone is 21."

Mainstream media, however, is not too shy to capitalize on the remnants of
e-culture, even while its core is marginalized, even criminalized.  During
the rainy drive home from the club, three radio stations are playing rave
music.  KROQ ( 106.7 FM ) weighs in with British 'progressive' house.
'Party Station' KDL ( 103.1 FM ) has pop trance.  And Power 106 ( 105.9 FM
) spins 'old school' techno.

Perhaps one of the surest signs a subculture has lost its edge is when
corporations co-opt its trappings for a big buck, and here in the
entertainment capital of the world, e-culture is for sale everywhere:
Mobile phones come with glow-in-the-dark accessories; psychedelic,
blinking lights; and ring-tone downloads set to trance.  Clear Channel,
the country's largest radio chain, and a conservative one at that, owns
KDL and has booked the king of trance DJs, Paul Oakenfold, at the
mainstream Wiltern Theatre in Koreatown.  It begs the question, where do
you draw the line when it comes to regulating culture? The unsuccessful
congressional RAVE Act would have held pacifiers, glow-sticks, and
repetitive beats as evidence that a club owner or party promoter
reasonably knows ecstasy use is going on at an event.  But we doubt the
feds will go after Clear Channel anytime soon.  With this kind of absurd
cultural policing, on top of what turned out to be faulty claims about the
dangers of ecstasy, it's no wonder kids have turned to their own
experiences to learn the hard way about the dark side of e-culture.

Agony

Chris, a 22-year-old office manager from Atlanta, felt so compelled about
the real dangers of E that he posted his story on an e-culture website for
all the world to see.  Last year he went through several cycles of
bingeing, only to end up in wild swings of depression or anger.

He did it "to escape reality, because of all the anxiety I had to deal
with," Chris says.  He was in a near break-up with his fiance.  "All the
while, I was making the problem that much worse.  I went into a deep
depression.  I couldn't deal with normal everyday problems - they made me
feel like I was going to blow up at the smallest thing.  Carrying around
that kind of attitude tends to push people away from you."

Six months off of E has helped Chris put his life in order and get back
together with his girl.  He still likes electronic music, but the scene is
where he used to be, in a black hole.

"The party scene definitely went downhill, and drugs are to blame for it,"
he says.  "A lot of heavier drugs like meth got popular.  The whole
feeling of it has changed.  It's not a friendly place to go.  There used
to be a feeling of unity.  Now people are all sketched-out on meth, others
are coked-out.  It's dirtied-up the scene in my opinion."

Many like him are graduating to greener pastures.  Chris warns the new
kids that "one of my friends abused ecstasy and sank into a depression and
never wanted to leave the house or even his room."

"I'd tell them before they try ecstasy to research it," he says.  "You
need to respect drugs like that.  It's a hard line to draw between using
and abusing.  If you end up in a hole, it's just not worth it, no matter
how good it felt."

That's probably good advice, according to Dr.  Charles Grob, a foremost
authority on the psychiatry of ecstasy who's based at L.A.'s Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center.  "If you give people honest info, they're more likely to
use good judgement," he says.

"If there's a dip right now in ecstasy use it has nothing to do with the
government's dubious anti-ecstasy campaigns," he says.  "These ebbs and
flows are cyclical."

The federally funded anti-drug campaigns started in 1999 with the
$54-million "club drug" media blitz and rolls ahead to this day.  The
latest commercial from the Partnership for a Drug-Free America depicts
young people frolicking in a pasture.  It's an almost humorous rave-style
mock-up of a major-pharmaceutical spot.  But the scene grows dark,
teenagers hit the ground and hang their heads low.  Subliminal messages
such as "depression" flash on screen.  Effective? Grob says not all of the
government's messages have been honest, making any official anti-E
arguments a hard sell with today's teens.

He points to the controversial research of Johns Hopkins University's
Dr.George A.  Ricaurte, a favorite scientific tool of the feds in their
war on e-culture.  His 2002 study concluded that even a single dose of
ecstasy could result in permanent brain damage.  But it turned out
Ricaurte's test subjects, baboons and squirrel monkeys, had been injected
with meth instead of E.  He withdrew the federally funded study, and the
journal Science retracted its publication of his findings.  Grob says that
kind of science will backfire with youth, who need to hear about the real
risks of E before learning the hard way.

"If the federal government's goal is for safety and welfare, Ricaurte's
research has blown up in their face," he says.  "Science in the service of
political agendas is very dangerous and distressing and
counterproductive."

"There are serious medical risks, especially in these dangerous rave
settings," Grob says of the drug.  "The younger the age, the more
psychiatric risks there are, for sure."

He warns that frequent use can lead to higher tolerance, higher doses, and
even graduation to the harder drug methamphetamine.  "Although they don't
get much effect from the MDMA, they're into the scene, so the meth will
energize them so they can dance all night," Grob says of these graduates.
He also says he has seen many people recover successfully from the effects
of long-term ecstasy abuse, and that there's always hope - and help -
available.

Former Los Angeles Police Department Detective Porrata would like to see
greater awareness of the dangers of driving on ecstasy ( which might have
contributed to a notorious 1999 car crash that took the lives of five
local ravers, for example ).  And she wants more warnings about eye damage
caused by lasers beaming into teenagers' dilated pupils at raves.  Ecstasy
causes this wide-eyed phenomenon, and Porrata says she's talked to doctors
who have seen vision problems as a result of too much eye candy.

Acting Out

This spring, Congress passed the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, a
renamed version of the RAVE Act.  It applies the infamous 1986 "crackhouse
law" to any illicit drug use at concerts, clubs, festivals, and live
performances - making club owners and promoters responsible for the
behavior of their paying guests.  Before it was rewritten, the Reducing
Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act equated raves with drug dens and
defined them as places where glow sticks, water consumption, and
repetitive beats are found.

After the nation's electronic music community protested, the language was
cleaned up to remove the rave slant and paraphernalia.  As it stands,
fines and penalties for venue owners and promoters found guilty of hosting
parties where drugs are knowingly used and tolerated can reach $750,000,
with the possibility of 20 years behind bars.  The new law could apply to
a rave, a reggae concert, and to a DJ set by Oakenfold at the Wiltern.

"This bill has drawn serious grass-roots opposition, and I know that I am
not alone in hearing from many constituents about their serious and
well-considered objections to it," a concerned Sen.  Patrick D.  Leahy
[D-Vermont] told the U.S.  Senate.  "Business owners have come to Congress
and told us there are only so many steps they can take to prevent any of
the thousands of people who may attend a concert or a rave from using
drugs.  They are worried about being held personally accountable for the
illegal acts of others."

Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Drug Policy
Alliance have promised to challenge the law the minute a rave promoter or
venue owner ends up in court.  Clearly, however, many club-owners and
promoters would rather not be in court at all and have shed the rave scene
in favor of hip-hop or house music events.

Some argue that the latest rave and ecstasy crackdowns only force those
who want to dance till dawn into dangerous, underground locales.  But
Detective Porrata says good riddance to mega-raves.

"When they say they have to go underground, they admit they have to keep
it about drugs," she argues.  "The culture is really depressing.  Going to
a rave is like standing in the middle of a giant ant farm, with people
milling about because they have that energy for mindless rotation.  I find
raves really sad."

The Roots

The Los Angeles rave scene took root in the late 1980s when the Levy
brothers from the U.K.  held "Moonshine" parties near downtown that
featured ecstasy-friendly acid-house music.  The return of homegrown DJ
Doc Martin from San Francisco in 1990, along with the launch of rave 'zine
Urb that year, solidified the city's capital status for stateside rave
culture ( despite the dubious claims of some authors that New York's scene
took off first ).

In boom-and-bust cycles, L.A.'s e-culture hit a low point in the mid-'90s,
when many burned-out ecstasy users simply dropped out of the scene,
although the hardcore moved on to the more economically potent
methamphetamine.  Gritty inner-city parties buoyed their need for speed.

In that era, a small club held in a deco residential hotel on Beverly
Boulevard, not far from the LAPD's notorious Rampart Station, was haunted
with lost souls hanging on to the music but too far gone to realize they
had hit the curb.  Speed was snorted in the bathroom and the hardcore
passed out next to booming loudspeakers.  By sunrise a chill-out lounge
was filled with zombies, some barely conscious, others passed out on the
dirty floor.  Every few hours or so an LAPD cruiser would stop out front
and officers would chitchat and joke around with the promoter.

Rave culture resurfaced again in 1996 with a local radio station, Groove
Radio, and concert-style electronic music events.  By 1997, the music
industry was abuzz about the potential of electronic sounds, a promise
that never quite filled the pockets of major-label suits, but one that
fueled e-culture's biggest wave yet.  From then on, the scene continued to
grow, consuming new micro-generations of followers hooked by MTV's Amp
e-music video show, Moby's No.  1 album Play, and college radio shows
across the nation.  Blockbuster sponsored a rave tour.  Microsoft paired
up with the foremost rave website, Raveworld.  Mitsubishi, which,
ironically or not, had its symbol become a popular stamp on ecstasy
tablets, featured a psuedo-pop-locking raver in a television commercial.

The growth continued until 9/11.

After that, there was "a national mood of cynicism," says ecstasy
proponent Doblin, head of the Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies.  "The open-hearted optimism associated with raves and
MDMA is out of fashion now.  It seems so hippyish and naive to talk about
peace, love, unity, and respect."

Today the mainstreaming continues, but the underground foundation has been
eroded.  Raveworld has been taken over by leading skateboard magazine
Thrasher.  MTV no longer airs Amp, although e-music videos do make it into
its mainstream rotation from time to time.  The music plays on in Hummer
advertisements and on commercial radio.

"There's been several cycles in the scene," says Gary Blitz, national
coordinator of the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund, which
formed to defend a New Orleans rave promoter unsuccessfully prosecuted by
the feds under the old crack house statute.  "No one wants to listen to
what their older brothers or sisters listened to.  It can't be the same as
it was 10 years ago."

Back at the Hollywood party, a young man standing outside admits that
things aren't as hype as they were only a few summers ago.  But he says
another cycle of teenagers is coming through the pipeline, ready to take
over where the dropouts left off.  "Us young people will bring it back,="
he promises.  "It's already coming back.  And the drugs will be around
till the day that I die."

TOMMY CHONG'S NEW JOINT

Serving nine months in federal prison for putting his face on a bong, one
of America's most beloved comics contemplates the war on stoners,
thoughtcrime and reuniting with Cheech.

The joke, of course, is that this is Sgt.  Stadanko's revenge.  The
arch-nemesis of every Cheech & Chong film, actor Stacey Keach seemed like
he'd play the greasy, bumbling narc forever, but now U.S.  Attorney
General and religious jihadist John Ashcroft has taken over the role, and
he's not playing it for laughs.

Sitting in the visitation area inside Taft Correctional Institution, a
privately run federal prison plunked in the Iraq-like oilfields of
California's Central Valley, Tommy Chong found out the hard way that
Ashcroft's Department of Justice is now busting thoughtcrime.  The
65-year-old writer and director of some of America's most beloved comedies
is astonished to find that his movies, in part, earned him nine months in
the federal pen.

"They came after me because of the movies, Up in Smoke, Cheech & Chong,
and because of my act since 1968," says Chong.  "They took my character to
be my real persona."

Is that your real persona? I have to ask.

"No," Chong chuckles.  "It's a character.  It's like the Furry Freak Bros.
Cheech & Chong are like comic-strip characters.  Everybody knows that the
real Cheech isn't the Cheech from Up in Smoke, and the real Tommy Chong
isn't the Tommy Chong from the 'Hey man' dude.

"But I was selling bongs with my picture on 'em.  And they said, 'Well,
this is Tommy Chong.' But I was like Christopher Reeve doing a Superman
promotion.  [U.S.  Attorneys] never saw it that way.  And they wanted to
make an example of me.  Really, what they wanted to do was to shut down
the whole culture."

Clearly, Chong's playing both sides.  He's not the headbanded,
acid-guitar-wielding ur-stoner from the movies, but he is sometimes
indistinguishable from that character, and he has embraced that image in
public.  Just like a lot of other performers.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, for
example, used quotes from his ultra-violent Terminator movies, like "Hasta
la vista, baby," when campaigning for governor.  Chong was right to assume
that this was not a crime.

Until now.  The current U.S.  Department of Justice ( DOJ ), unlike any in
the last 30 years, has changed the rules.  Since 9/11, the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) has run ads equating
marijuana use with supporting terrorism, and the DOJ has taken that
outrageous pronouncement to the next level, equating glassware sales with
drug dealing.

On Feb.  24, federal agents launched two simultaneous national sweeps for
purveyors of drug paraphernalia, Operation Pipe Dreams out of the U.S.
Attorney's office in western Pennsylvania, and Operation Headhunter out of
the Northern District of Iowa.  Under an apparently little-used 1980s
federal law, they scooped up umpteen thousand bongs, pipes, roach clips
and even rolling papers from mail-order and Internet suppliers whose
shipments crossed state lines.  One of those was the Gardena, Calif.,
business run by Chong's son Paris, called Nice Dreams Enterprises, doing
business as Tommy Chong Glass.

Fifty-five individuals and companies were busted across the country that
day.  A few others got prison time.  The one who got the longest sentence
was Tommy Chong.  He reported to prison on Oct.  8, and he'll be there
until July 2004.  A judge recently rejected requests for home detention or
early release.

"Tommy's the only one that's gotten a federal sentence," says Allen St.
Pierre, spokesperson for the National Organization to Reform Marijuana
Laws, or NORML.  "He had no prior arrests.  He was no flight risk.  He is
a cultural icon and a taxpayer, probably higher than most of us.  And
certainly did not fit the basic criteria of who should go to jail for
paraphernalia."

But there's one criterion he fit just too neatly.  Every burnout in
America would hear about it and get scared.

"[Chong] wasn't the biggest supplier.  He was a relatively new player.
But he had the ability to market products like no other," said U.S.
Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan at Chong's sentencing.

"They went after Tommy Chong because he was just what they needed," says
St.  Pierre.  "If you have to think of one individual that would represent
the government's efforts to enforce prohibition, or a representative of
the negative stereotype, then, out of a country of almost 300 million
Americans, there's really only about three or four people who fit that
bill: Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson and Tommy Chong."

Dave's Not Here, Man

If only life really were like the movies.  Then Chong and some of the
inmates would fashion several pairs of gargantuan rave pants out of
sweetleaf and, during a prison foam party featuring a jail appearance by,
say, Cypress Hill's DJ Muggs, escape in a paisley Beetle full of girls in
fuzzy bikini tops, dank smoke pouring out all four windows.  Leaving
Stadanko blissed-out in the center of the cafeteria dance floor, having
found his new high.

Instead, Chong's new reality is a lot more like some crappy, badly
soundtracked episode of Cops.

The investigation into Nice Dreams Enterprises was months in the making,
as agents of the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ), posing as
a head shop in Beaver Falls, Penn., just northwest of Pittsburgh, tried to
order glassware from Nice Dreams.

"The reason they didn't indict me until later is because our company
wouldn't send the order to Pennsylvania," says Chong.  The company was
wary of the U.S.  Attorney's office in the area, which is one of the
country's most conservative.  "They faked like they were a head shop,
saying, 'C'mon, man, your stuff's selling so great, we need $6,000 worth.'
I heard the tape where they [Nice Dreams] turned 'em down.'

But, eventually, the order was filled.  The federal paraphernalia law
makes it illegal to transport across state lines any device for the use of
illicit drugs.  Such laws were common at the state and municipal level in
the 1980s, but a 1994 U.S.  Supreme Court ruling made a somewhat ambiguous
federal law available to DOJ prosecutors.

"The decision was called 'Iowa vs.  Poster-N-Things,'" says NORML's St.
Pierre.  "It basically boils down to this.  What would a reasonable person
think the product is going to be used for? If you're a prosecutor, and
you're gonna bring charges on paraphernalia, you would want to bring
forward all of the cultural affectations that the products in question are
being sold in."

Which means that bongs for sale in a store might not be protected by
California law, which requires they be clearly marked "For Tobacco Use
Only." According to the Supreme Court, if there are High Times magazines
also for sale, stickers and T-shirts with pot leaves on them, even NORML
pamphlets on the countertop, this might indicate that the devices are to
be used with marijuana.

Nice Dreams, being an interstate glassware seller by mail and Internet,
was guilty by association with its own products.  The company sold Tommy
Chong urinalysis kits to test for THC, the psychoactive ingredient in pot,
a Tommy Chong Get Clean shampoo and Tommy Chong Urine Luck, a urine-sample
additive that would guarantee a clean test for marijuana.  Plus, of
course, stuff with pot leaves and Tommy's face on it.  Which was taken as
evidence that this stuff was meant for The Chronic.

"So you get that before a jury of 12 reasonable people," adds St.  Pierre,
"and the reasonable person, more often than not, says, 'No, I think that
that bong with the big marijuana leaf on it, sold in that place with all
these other things around it, with drug testing kits and stuff, that was
probably not for tobacco.'"

Assistant U.S.  Attorney Mary McKeen Houghton pointed out at the trial
that almost a pound of marijuana was seized at Chong's house-but he was
never prosecuted for possession.  They had a bigger target in mind.  The
glassware itself-and, strangely, only glass bongs and pipes were seized,
not plastic, bamboo or any other thing-has now been criminalized.  It's
not about what consumers do with it; it's what they might do with it.
That is what's known as a thoughtcrime, a crime that never actually
occurs.

As in George Orwell's book 1984, thoughtcrime has now become dangerous.
On Feb 24, agents of the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA )
kicked at the door of Tommy Chong's home at 5:30 a.m., automatic weapons
drawn, red laser sights flashing down the darkened halls.  Chong and his
wife, Shelby, who is also a comedian, were asleep.

"Oh, it was a full-on raid," says Chong.  "Helicopters, them bangin' on
the door.  They come in with loaded automatic weapons, flak jackets,
helmets, visors, about 20 agents.  They bust in the house.  They took all
my cash, took out my computers, and they took all the glass bongs they
could find."

Down in Gardena at the Nice Dreams plant, a similar raid took place,
though it was more civilized.  Agents simply walked in and carted away all
the glassware, computers and business records.

"I thought it was a joke," Chong says.  "I thought they had the wrong
house.  You hear about these guys coming to the wrong house all the time.
And then when I found out about the bongs, I was really mad, because my
son Paris had just started to make money with the company.  I was just
outraged."

Sister Mary Elephant

Mary Beth Buchanan, U.S.  Attorney for the Western District of
Pennsylvania, is also playing both sides of Chong's publicity.  On the
press and on the Internet.  Comics were among the first to read the
writing on the wall.  Jay Leno, no friend of the marijuana movement,
slammed the government in a monologue, as did Jon Stewart.  Lane, an
ice-rink marketing director, co-wrote a still-unsold script with Chong
about a dope-smoking hockey team, subtly titled Biff Spliff and the
Potheads.  In November, Lane organized the Free Tommy Chong Brigade to
march in Pasadena's annual Doo-Dah Parade, where, he says, he received "a
tremendous ovation."

"I think [Chong's arrest] galvanizes the movement, if anything," Lane
adds.

"It definitely has a chilling effect," counters NORML's St.  Pierre.
"High Times magazine would be a very good example.  They started to lose a
very high percentage of their ad base immediately based on that.  So that
has an immediate chilling effect on a magazine that, in essence, is the
First Amendment vehicle for the drug-policy movement.  Paraphernalia is a
billion-dollar industry."

Chong is one of them who lost a lot of money selling bongs.  The company
was still $500,000 in the hole on paper, he says, and he didn't recoup.
But his newfound notoriety is creating the ultimate springboard back into
Cheech & Chong.

"It all helps," he says.  "I'm getting so much fan mail here that I'm
going to have to hire somebody to help me answer it.  Mail call here is
like two sacks, one for me and one for the rest of the people."

Before he went to prison, Chong was already writing a book, The Cheech &
Chong Story.  Now he's definitely going to write up material about going
to prison-and the stories he's heard from other inmates.  "Oh, absolutely!
I'm definitely writing it.  But I'm not going to do anything radical until
I'm out of here," he says.  "And I got a year of probation to look forward
to."

That's time he's going to use for introspection, for his drug-education
classes ( "I teach them more than they teach me" ), for building sculpture
and for savoring his new relationship to his old buddy Cheech.  Which
already seems to be off on the right foot.  "They said on the Internet
that part of the reason I got a sentence is because I never gave anybody
up, you know?" he deadpans.  "But I woulda gave up Cheech in a minute!
[Long laugh.] I woulda told on him, man! And I know everything about him!
And I still will if they'd give me some time off!"

Then you believe that the state (our Republic) should be involved in 
religious matters, such as the definition of "marriage?"  I think our 
Constitution makes it clear that the state has no business here.  Let the 
various religious sects define what they wish to "bless."  What is needed 
from the state, whether at the local or federal level, is a definition a 
domestic partnership that will enable those, both gay and straight, to 
manage property and other needs with the same clarity and legal support as 
those who are now considered "married."  Over 50% of the population in the 
US is now single or involved in non-traditional partnership.

As for Christians, Jews, and other religious groups:  it is now possible to 
find many congregations throughout the nation who will "bless" your union 
if that is what you want.  Again, "marriage" is a religious issue, and 
should not be a part of the Democratic, Republican or other platforms.  Any 
attempt to define marriage by the state is, to my mind, akin to the 
establishment of religious belief and therefore is prohibited by the 
constitution.

I must say that the definition of "Christian" and related "family values" 
in this country are a continuing source of frustration for me.  I have read 
the Gospels over and over again, and I see very little relationship between 
those who call themselves "Christian" -- some of our leaders claim God 
talks to them -- and the spirit of the message of Christ.  Christ was not 
materialistic.  His focus was on love, compassion, peacemaking, integrity 
and fidelity, and giving.  What we have here is an economic and political 
system that seems to reward greed, violence, and falsehood at the expense 
of all the virtues extolled in the Gospels.  Christians.  Nope.  More like 
secularists who practice situational ethics and use the platform of 
Christianity to justify their unchristian actions.  I respect Christ, 
whoever he was, but I have a genuine loathing for those who use his name to 
promulgate violence on others, justify personal bigotry, and fill their 
wallets at the expense of the poor.

These people say that gays and "deviants" are destroying "family 
values."  What a crock.  Materialistic capitalism destroyed the family, not 
folks who just want to love each other in bed without being persecuted for 
that love.

Much love,

Apollo

hey kidz

damn, these days society seems more confused than ever, , ,some of the =
shit you see on tv is rediculous while other things are kind of =
inspiring/suprising.

Like the international male commercials on tv. . . I love the fact that =
some peoples' view and opinion of homosexuality have broadened in such a =
way. Finally a commercial on regular daytime tv that supports gay men. =
Even with the popularity of lesbianism, there are now commercials =
supporting the gay or curious man. I have yet to see gay female =
commercials, but just this fact itself kinda shows a huge opening of the =
minds of tons and tons of american people. The commercials are kinda =
cool too, like the big guy working out, whos all sweet n friendly, =
talking about finding a man he could finally talk to. . .=20

but then there are all the anti-marijuana commercials (most have ceased =
to appear like the lil miss muffet sat on her tuffet ones), that show =
these "bugs on drugs" who can't play basketball. .. etc .. I'm happy to =
not see all those "marijuana, it's more dangerous than we all thought" =
commercials which are just totally rediculous. Like the dumbasses who =
drive thru the drive-thru at some fast food place multiple times just to =
realize that none of them have money. . .meanwhile some irresponsible =
(non pot head) parent tells their lil girl it's cool for her to drive =
back and forth in front of commercial driveways all day long, resulting =
in her eventually getting hit by a car. . . now who's fault is that ?

and one of the most irritating commercials I've ever seen was that =
fuckin Christian Childrens Fund one, where some idot white santa clause =
looking guy tells these kids that "Their only crime is being born poor".
First, they're saying these kids are born poor. . . like theres some =
"poor gene" in their blood at the time of birth that controls their =
eventual fate. Then, this fucker is sitting their saying it's the kids =
fault and actually a crime for being born under unfortunate =
circumstances. . . fucken christians, seriously. . . this commercial =
totally puts out the message of pitying less fortunate people rather =
than simply understanding their situation and sympathizing with them =
(which is quite diffirent). Someone really needs to smack these people. =
. .=20

and someday if I ever see santa again, I will. . .=20

but yeah, just a rant. . .=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [nrr] RE: Support EQUAL Federal Marriage Laws!

ACTUALLY Mr. Mundergaarde,

Although I agree with Apollo's viewpoint, specifically that "marriage" should not be part of
governmental law and that people be given the right to assign the same rights to others as "married"
couples do, technically, his rebuttal was completely invalid.  He in fact inferred that by agreeing
with NOT "...[forcing] states to recognize other living arrangements as [currently defined by our
existing laws] marriages," that Sarilion was FOR allowing the government to continue to define
"marriage."  In fact Sarilion stated explicitly that he "[thinks] the term "marriage" should be
wiped off the books entirely."  So Apollo is arguing a different issue than the one originally
stated, as well as using the fallacy of circumstantial ad hominem against Sarilion.

Still, although logically failing to invalidate Sarilion's statements, specifically: claiming that
agreeing with the end result of body's decision requires agreeing completely with all of the
ideology that the decision is dependant upon, Apollo makes valid points.  Not sure who he's making
the points to ;)  It can't be Sarrilion, since he has stated that he and Sarilion are in agreement
on the issue of civil union.

Regardless,

A few weeks ago I basically stated some of the same things as Apollo (paraphrased as i don't
remember EXACTLY):

"I am not for the governmental recognition of 'Gay Marriages.'  What we need are removal of the term
'marriage' from our Laws, not more bad Laws defining it."

Basically the same, although granted less eloquently, and got a slew of infuriating personal emails
from people on this list who began reading me the riot act on how "people like me are the sole
reason the world is a fucked up place."  These people somehow assumed being against "Gay Marriage"
was synonymous with being against "Gay Rights" or against homosexual people alltogether.  Then they
all went flying of on unrecognizable tangents.  I dunno, people love to fight... and when feel they
are on the "just" underdog side, they fight even more blindly ruthless.

Yeah, people love to fight.  I love to argue.

If you know the difference between the two, then you're ahead of most and Apollo, Sarilion, as well
as myself, are probably preachin' to the choir...

Hee, I love how the Religious Right is all concerned about the Morning After
pill being available OTC, saying it will lead to irresponsible sexual
behavior.  Yet at the same time, we get bombarded by Viagra commercials.
Its so sexist.  Men can get boner pills right over the phone, encouraged by
baseball stars and Bob Dole.

But give women a new contraceptive option??   Oh no, that would be horrible.

I think Old Navy commercials are the gayest thing on TV... well, except
maybe for professional wresling.

Speaking of marketing and advertising, anyone see "Merchants of Cool" last 
night on PBS?  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/

Where does marketing end and the individual soul begin?:)

Glad you liked it. That's an unfinished track I was working on a couple
years ago. Enough people have asked me about it that I think I should
try to get it done.

As far as Viberation, we're all still around save for Siphon who moved
to LV. Viberation graphics is still doing visuals, and most of us still
DJ. We just haven't gotten our asses in gear to do a party in a while.

No, I believe, as I stated above (which I thought was pretty clear the 
first time around):

"I think the term "marriage" should be wiped off the books entirely; it's 
NOT a secular term"

I want to SECULARIZE ALL UNIONS.  Regardless of gender.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Leviticus / Gay Christians

Again, this goes back to my other email - at the time the Old Testament was 
written, Christ wasn't around.  Simply put, God wasn't happy with the way 
his people lived, so he sent his son in to die for our sins.  After Christ 
died, the New Testament was written.  The Gospels are accounts of four 
apostle's spreading Christ's message to other lands.  What I took from 
Leviticus is from the Old Testament.  Pre-Christ dying for sins.

I posted some of the other arcane rules from Leviticus to show exactly that 
point - the sexual rules aren't really taken all that seriously.  I'm not 
surprised that someone with such a weak understanding of language, however, 
wouldn't understand that Christians do own both the words marriage and 
christmas.

I understand that, Sarilion.  What I don't understand is how you can 
support the RNC having a platform that states they support the traditional 
definition of "marriage" when this is a religious matter.  This shouldn't 
even be a subject for political discussion, or a part of any 
platform.  Period.  You state that "marriage" is a religious term, then you 
say it should be wiped off the books, and finally you agree with the RNC.

Love,

Apollo

Clearly you're missing the point, so I'll lay it out.

The religious right is against ALL FORMS of contraceptives, including condoms.

Viagra is targeted at old people.  Old people still like to fuck, but can't 
get it up.  The don't have babies either.. but not because of 
contraceptives;  it simply isn't possible as men and women lose their 
potency with age.

"Paradox is veteran International music producer Dev Paradox. His career
started back in 1988 when 'Mixrace' was formed with partner DJ Trax. The
first professional recording by Mixrace was in 1990 and was produced by
the Plastic Jam (of Labello Blanco recordings).=20

=20

After brief relations with Surburban Base and Strictly Underground
Records the first Mixrace 12" surfaced in 1991 on the early Moving
Shadow Records Label. Both producers only 17 at the time released the
early Mixrace Hardcore classic 'Too Bad for Ya/The Future is Before Your
Eyes' (SHADOW 018).=20

=20

Four more releases followed on the Moving Shadow label and in 1995 Dev
and Trax set up their own Stronghold, Mobhanded and Offset Recordings
labels.=20

=20

New artist guises surfaced in 1996 in the forms of 'Alaska' and
'Paradox'. Dev wanted to show his diversity by creating two different
genre's of drumfunk with Alaska being the ambient monkier of the two,
and Paradox exploring the drum patterns of 1970's funk.=20

=20

As Trax started to program breakbeat at different tempo's, Paradox's
sound took off in another direction with a string of releases on
Renegade Hardware, Certificate 18 and Reinforced Records.=20

=20

Eight years on and we're rapidly approaching 2004. Dev has now recorded
for over an amazing 23 record labels including 4-Hero's legendary
Reinforced Records, LTJ Bukem's Good Looking, Certificate 18, Partisan,
Renegade Hardware, Timeless, Total Science's CIA, Blame's 720 Degrees,
Nexus, Danny Break's Droppin Science, Subject 13's Vibez Recordings,
Twisted Funk, Toshiba-EMI, Ninebar, Sonica, 2000 Black, Sheebeen,
Form-3, Holland's Rush Hour Records, New York's Offshore Recordings, and
Italy's Archive Records.=20

=20

In the studio music collaborations have included artists such as
Sweden's prolific Seba, DJ Nucleus, EZ Rollers, Flytronix, Subject 13
and Volcov.=20

=20

Paradox remixing duties include 4-Hero for Talkin Loud/Mercury, Yasushi
Ide for Warner Brothers, Boom Boom Satelites for Sony/Epic, LTJ Bukem
for Good Looking, Justice, James Hardway, NXS, Blue, Trax for Lacerba,
Konami Arcades, Sony Playstation and Japanese Manga Cartoon Company
Marine Entertainment/Avex inc.=20

=20

Paradox is sponsored by Firetrap, Acupuncture footwear, Bloc Eyewear,
and Aerosoul clothing.=20

=20

Dev Paradox is also without doubt a live touring machine outside the
studio. Every month of the year you can catch Paradox's live show truely
worldwide. Dev has visited all corners of the globe and has headlined
live shows in East and West Coast America, Asia and all over Europe from
Iceland to Latvia.=20

=20

Paradox has continued to work with fellow producer Nucleus on countless
projects and 2004 see's their new LP surfacing on Reinforced Records.=20

=20

Drumfunk will take control....... "

"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the 'Universe,' a part 
limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and 
feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion 
of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting 
us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. 
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles 
of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in 
its beauty."
-Albert Einstein

Subject: [sfraves] Progression: Night of delightful dancing

If you thought about dancing last night, and did not make it out to Progression at 26Mix for whatever reason, you missed a great night in a nice venue.

Thankfully, they do it every month and you should definitely check it out, especially if you are a dancer, like me.

It was my first time to 26Mix and I have to say, what a great venue, with the true flavor of San Francisco (old-style neighborhood bar with the neon cocktail sign outside and comfortable, lounge-around feeling inside). For the dancers, there is a large wooden floor, for the lounge lizards, there is cozy seating, a nice, long bar, friendly people, and a wonderful pool table. 

Top that off with an eclectic mix of DJs, including (last night) remarkable talents like Hoj and Cantos (from Sacramento) and you have all of the elements for a hand-clapping, booty-shaking good time.

Jack Triumph, please keep up the good work. I am proud of your monthly party—Progression is a great way to spend a Sunday night.

Greg VP

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  SOUTH CAROLINA STUDENTS TERRORIZED BY POLICE DRUG RAID

--=====================_6679033==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

SOUTH CAROLINA STUDENTS TERRORIZED BY POLICE DRUG RAID

Students as young as 14 were terrorized by police with guns and 
drug-sniffing dogs in an early-morning SWAT raid at Stratford High School 
in Goose Creek, South Carolina.  The raid violated the students' rights, 
the ACLU has charged in a lawsuit filed on behalf of 20 families.

The ACLU complaint is online at:
http://www.aclu.org/DrugPolicy/DrugPolicy.cfm?ID=14578&c=19&MX=1093&H=0

The SWAT team-style raid on school children sparked national outrage after 
a school videotape of the November 5 incident was broadcast on 
television.  A police video of the raid has now surfaced that shows even 
more disturbing detail of police handcuffing students and holding guns to 
their heads while a large drug dog sniffed and tore at the students' book bags.

No drugs or weapons were found during the sweep and no charges were filed.

A copy of the school surveillance videotape, narrated by Goose Creek 
Principal George McCrackin, is online at (Real Player is required):
http://stream.realimpact.net/rihurl.ram?file=realimpact/cms/aclu/20031205_ACLU_DrugBust.rm

The ACLU's lawsuit charges school and police officials violated the 
students' right to be free from unlawful search and seizure and use of 
excessive force. The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring the raids 
unconstitutional and blocking officials from carrying out future raids, as 
well as damages on behalf of the students who were terrorized.

The ACLU said such unconstitutional tactics are on the rise as schools 
increasingly apply the "zero tolerance" approach to perceived drug problems 
in schools.  But these escalating measures have no justification in reality 
since long-term studies show that student drug use has declined in the last 
10 years.

Zero tolerance policies also have a disproportionate affect on minority 
students, who are frequently far more harshly disciplined than their white 
counterparts. A New York Times story about the raid noted that while black 
students make up less than a quarter of the 2,700 students at Stratford 
High School, two-thirds of the 107 students caught up in the sweep were black.

As 16-year-old Joshua Ody, one of the students caught up in the sweep, put 
it: "I felt like I had less rights than other people that day."

the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

but for new years don't you want to go all out crazy?

If anyone knows if this years will be worth wild more then last years let me 
know please...

stopping by the event but i might not stay as long :-\

Subject: [sfraves] Ouch...the grinch stole my christmas....and my couches
 

Hey there party people!....Karyna here and well this is my first posting ever so I hope (cross my fingers) I am doing this properly...well at least I got you to bite with a nifty little subject line...hehehe

No but really, here is my shpeel...my three lovely roommates have moved from what use to be "our" home into a new home, and so now it is "my" UNFURNISHED HOME! (and yes the "lovely" is dripping with sarcasm) and well, this Karyna at the very least needs one couch to watch all of the "Buffy" re-runs on the F/X.  But seriously I really do desperatly need a couch or something of that nature.  So, if you or anyone you know has a not-so-badly-violated sofa, couch, futon, loveseat, lazy-boy, you get the picture...I would be more than eager and willing to take it off of their hands.

Umm...if they have two even better...my living room is obnoxiously huge and one couch really isn't enough (we use to, or they still do, have three).  I would be very grateful, thus far December hasn't been the kindest month to me, I didn't have much notice on my roomies moving plans and such...So, if you know anybody that is looking for a new place I have one room that has yet to be rented (move-in: it's ready right now; price: $600mo + utilities/ deposit $600) It's very convenient for SFSU, city college students...5 minute walk to BART where the SFSU shuttle stops and provides free rides to campus...it's a pretty quite neighborhood and there's plenty of street parking...It's convenient for just about anybody, either by car or public transit you can get to just about anywhere in the city in about 10-30 minutes.

Ok, so if you'd like to check the place out or get further details or help a couchless-gril out please give me a call @ (415)515-8335 and leave a message...I would like to have the room rented out sooner than later, so like by next monday/tuesday I'm thinking...

Hope to hear from anybody and everybody soon...Have a VERY HAPPY HOLIDAYS and 
May the MAGIC of the SEASON be with YOU!

Ciao,
Karyna Fuentes

Ok...so, I couldn't really figure this thing out....boo-hoo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] re: QUESTION http://www.viberation.com/ 

hehe, cool to see your mention, thanks =)

Our site hasn't been updated in years, even since the '99 Brookdale party.
Kind of a nostalgia site now.

Everyone's still doing their thing, although more independently than as a
group.

But we all tend to keep hanging out and workin' it together regularly,
like tonight at Secret Psychedelica. Noah came up from vegas (Happy B-Day
Siphon =)

We recently got new high-power video projectors, if anyone's interested in
visuals support.

Perhaps if the planets align while the iron is hot we may even throw
another party ;-)

what you are asking is an opinion. yes it is going to rock some people and
yes some people will say it is going to suck. since you are not asking about
an underground or an invite only party, i would suggest you go, just watch
out for all the cops and drug sniffing dogs. oh yeah dont forget the $5
bottles of water and the three hour line to use the porta potty. on the
bright side i believe that NO LEFT TURN is playing at PNY so if you do go
dont miss his set, it will probably be one of the only thing worth going
for.

AMBER ALERT
 

 

Please look at the picture and then forward it on. 

Maybe if every one passes this on someone will see this child, that is
how the girl from Stevens Point was found by circulation of her picture
on tv.  The internet circulates even overseas South America, and Canada
etc. Thanks 
Please pass this to everyone in your address book. 


We have a store manager (Wal-Mart) from Longs, SC who has a  9 year old
daughter who has been missing for 2 weeks. Keep the picture moving on. 
With luck on her side she will be found. 
I am asking you all,  begging you to please forward this email 
on to anyone and everyone you know,  PLEASE.   My 9 year old girl, 
Penny Brown,  is missing.   She has been missing for now two weeks.. 
It is still not too late.  Please help us.  If anyone anywhere 
knows anything,  please contact me at: zicozicozico@hotmail.com 
I am including a picture of her.   All prayers are appreciated!! 
It only takes 2 seconds to forward this on.   If it was your child, 
you would want all the help you could get. 
Thank you for your kindness.  Hopefully you can help us.

Have Yourself a Pentagon Christmas

By Nick Turse, <http://www.tomdispatch.com>tomdispatch.com
December 22, 2003

'Tis the season for putting wish lists together! It's the least the toy 
industry expects of you. After all, according to the National Retail 
Federation, $217 billion in holiday sales are up for grabs and an anxious 
toy industry is hoping to take home a sizeable chunk of that (especially 
given last year's weak $20.3 billion toy market).

As for you, it's never too early to head into the mall maelstrom in search 
of the hottest toy in shortest supply for your child. Toy industry pundits 
and child experts are rushing out their lists of recommendations. If you 
want to catch that blank look of disappointment on your child's face this 
Christmas morning, by all means follow their advice. Go buy Hasbro's BTR 
Transformer off the Toy Wishes "Hot Dozen" list; K'nex's Rippin' Rocket 
Roller Coaster, one of FamilyFun magazine's "Toys of the Year" or strip 
those shelves of Mattel's Hokey Pokey Elmo from KB Toys annual "Holiday Hot 
Toy List."

But if you'd really like to "wow" the kids, stick to this list of "Hot as 
Depleted Uranium Toys for a New Imperial Age."

You surely don't want to deny your child the right to strut an 
aircraft-carrier flight deck or duke it out in person with Osama bin Laden. 
So from the Pentagon to you, via us, comes the A (for "Armed to the Teeth") 
list of presents sure to make this a true military-industrial Christmas!

America's Last Action Heroes

What would the holidays be without little muscularized, molded plastic 
dolls holding big guns in a kung-fu battle grip?

Now, thanks to Blue Box International your child can pilot Air Force One 
into Baghdad with 
<http://www.etoys.com/genProduct.html/PID/2431939/ctid/17/ls/default>Elite 
Force Aviator: George W. Bush, the greatest American hero, dolled-up in 
Naval Aviator regalia – a fully posable 12" action figure in "g-pants." 
"Actual figure," warns the maker, "may vary slightly from item shown" 
(which is so totally Mission Accomplished!) Then, for only an extra $29.95 
(plus shipping and handling) your child can feed the troops a turkey dinner 
using the <http://www.talkingpresidents.com/products-af-bush.shtml>George 
W. Bush Talking Action Figure, the aviator's civilian counterpart, clad in 
the more traditional Republican dark suit and red power tie. He spouts 17 
phrases including the apropos Bush-ism "...working hard to put food on your 
family..."

And that's only the beginning! Just imagine your son holding his own news 
conference with 
<http://www.talkingpresidents.com/products-af-rummy.shtml>the Talking 
Donald "Rummy" Rumsfeld Action Figure ($29.99 plus shipping and handling) 
to announce that weapons of mass destruction have just been discovered in 
Bethesda, Maryland. Press his button and catch 28 different phrases from 
"Rumstud" (as the Elite Aviator likes to call him) including the classic: 
"I believe what I said yesterday. I don't know what I said. But I know what 
I think. I assume that's what I said."

And you California parents, don't miss 
<http://store1.yimg.com/I/herobuilders_1761_1965385>the Talking Governator, 
hero of Total Recall, the movie and the election, in plastic form... or 
call him Robot Arnie and fight the world with 
<http://www.etoys.com/genProduct.html/PID/2458879/ctid/17/ls/default>the 
T-850 Terminator in his black-leather get-up.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

AMBER ALERT
 

 

Please look at the picture and then forward it on. 

Maybe if every one passes this on someone will see this child, that is how the girl from Stevens Point was found by circulation of her picture on tv.  The internet circulates even overseas South America, and Canada etc. Thanks 
Please pass this to everyone in your address book. 


We have a store manager (Wal-Mart) from Longs, SC who has a  9 year old daughter who has been missing for 2 weeks. Keep the picture moving on. 
With luck on her side she will be found. 
I am asking you all,  begging you to please forward this email 
on to anyone and everyone you know,  PLEASE.   My 9 year old girl, 
Penny Brown,  is missing.   She has been missing for now two weeks.. 
It is still not too late.  Please help us.  If anyone anywhere 
knows anything,  please contact me at: zicozicozico@hotmail.com 
I am including a picture of her.   All prayers are appreciated!! 
It only takes 2 seconds to forward this on.   If it was your child, 
you would want all the help you could get. 
Thank you for your kindness.  Hopefully you can help us.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: working today?

Yep, I'm stuck at the desk today. It's yucky outside and I'm watching the rain through a window. This office is so boring, we don't even have Christmas "muzak."

Time for some MP3s.

Have a Merry Christmas, everybody.

See you at the UG on NYE.

I'm stuck at work, but it's only a half day here so I'm out at 1pm. It's been kinda slow so if anyone has Madden 2004 or NHL 2004 PS2, I'll be online playing the game while working. My username on the game is ErbilT

Yeh, I just realized that I'm complaining about being at a job in which I have a PS2 with internet access in front of my desk, but it still sucks that I do not have a real holiday break. ::shrugs::

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: working today?

Where I work, we're open until 1:00 and then we're off until Monday. I didn't ask for any extra days. This is a big improvement over my last job: if I was still there, I'd need to work on Friday for sure, and if my boss was nice enough to let me leave early today, he'd dock my pay. The jerk. 

That last job, everybody got a $25 card from Safeway. That was pretty cool, but where I work now, I got a fat bonus. So now I have a new digital camera and some other stuff, hurray!  

Hanging in there until 1:00 ... and then it's over the river (Sacramento River) and through the woods to be with my family. 

Happy Holidays everyone
:)

I am diligently working on last of the office xmas goodies... All the 
Scotchmallows may be long gone from the See's boxes, but I've managed a 
carmel-induced bliss most of the morning; Going home before I'm reduced 
to eating marzipan, however.

OK... so Jaze picks me up & we head 2 the City... we stop by a friends pad & for a while well.. some kinda adventure started... then we treked over to The Top 4 Phuturo...

The crowd was Sik!  I mean... the dance floor was rockin' as hard as the DJs spinning... there was this Mondo Groovy vibe I totally felt...

It was really just an amazing night... other than the Super Amount of energy in the club... I got 2 spend time w/ the Junglist Crew I been hella missin'!!  Hello 2day, Almost all the old schools were out lastnight!!  So Dope!!

I seriously musta danced so long & hard 'cause all the elements mixed 2gether totally filled me up & man... it was just fuckin' Awesome man... there was this moment that was kinda CooL when I was dancing like in the middle of the floor & I had my eyes closed & jus' moved however the music made me... but aside from that... I spent most my time up in the front by the DJ booth w/ Audio Angel dancin' up a storm!

I dunno man.. there's not 2 much else 2 say about how Dope it was last night... I mean.. the energy carried through 'til the end of the night & Jaze & I left totally satisfied with out time there!!  I mean... like right now, I'm still hella Happy about lastnight man... I got this mondo afterglow 'cause yeah... LoL... hello 2Day.. y'all know what I'm sayin' by now... LoL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Sticky Sets Online!

Seems like our (dj2) set was kinda distorting the recorder, and when we
turned up the bass it really farted out.  Oh well..  At least it
sounded good in the room at the time.

Delaney's drum mic seems to never record just right..  Someday we're
going to have to stage a live show in the studio, and have some peeps
come over and pretend to cheer at the right spots :)

Cheers all,

Subject: [sfraves] Happy Holidays, sfraves

--=====================_9477497==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Wishing all of you a happy holiday and a new year filled with love, light 
and liberty.

I, for one, am happy to see 2003 go away.  It was a year filled with much 
darkness, divisiveness and violence IMO.  Hoping there is some positive 
change in the new  year.

A raver from another list forwarded the lyrics to what has become the 
Holiday hit single in the UK.

It's a re-working of the 1982 Tears for fears song "Mad World" sung by the 
unknown Gary Jules.  Just a simple vocal and piano recording with no post
production. The song is haunting and captured the popular mood at the end 
of a rather sad year.

Here are the lyrics for the British Christmas hit of 2003:

 >>

All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
'Cos I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad World
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

 >>

Much love to all of you, sfraves,

Apollo

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the

That is just one promoter at one party in SF.. CWP does not speak for all 
"SF"

Look at Spundaes lineup Tall paul,Dave Ralph and The Scumfrog..

That is a decent lineup for NYE considering that Sasha,Diggers and Sander 
Kleinenberg are already booked in other cities. And not to mention the other 
countless talent that is playing in NYC this NYE..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [NRR]: TRUE CRIM STREETS OF LA (GameCube,XBOX,PS2) 


I saw my homie playing this on his PS2 the other day.

SO BADASS. Kung fu scenes. Chopstick-to-the-neck (squick!) hyperbole
madness, driving, shooting, chasing, arresting, good cop, bad cop, better
drive-bys than GTA could ever hope for...

I dunno. I think it's just about the best game I've ever seen.

Subject: [sfraves] Santa sat on my lap!

So early this morning, a great thing happened.  I was woken up by this 
glorious man, It was Santa Claus. so sexy, full figured and hot as shit.  He 
saw me laying on my mother's couch awaiting his arrival.  I pretended not to 
notice his power bulge in those soft velvet red pants of his, but it was 
hard, very hard.  Santa walked over to me and began carressing my hair, 
stroking my emotions of truth.  He knew me.  Yes he did.  So anyway, to make 
a long story short, Santa swept my chimney and stuft my stocking and now is 
time to eat with the family.
Merry xmas to all.  I hope yer holidaze were as fulfilling as mine  ;P
Danny Picard

okay, that diddit

maybe summayoo remember when I posted about MAD COWS DISEASE a long ass =
time ago. . .=20

it was this disease urinating somewhere in europe from infected cow =
remains that were used to feed other cows. . .=20
It quickly crossed the seas and was found in various places in the US. =
Not much was ever mentioned about it.=20

Cows infected with this become horribly enraged, roaming city streets, =
sticking their tongues in their noses. . .killing every living creature =
in sight just to get=20
to the poor victims lil brains. Once they uncover a human brain, these =
so called "Happy Cows" immediately call upon their cow "homies" and =
commence an
act which can only be assumed to be some type of "tea party". They then =
eat the poor victims lil brain and do some kind of ritual called "The =
Freak" with other "Happy Cows" in celebration of their victory.

When a simple minded McDonalds frequenter is exposed to this virus. . .a =
similar rage comes upon them. But for some odd and (to this date) =
unknown reason the humans infected exhibit a preponderance to eat =
strange objects, touch themselves in frightening ways. . .and the worst =
part. . .they make ugly faces and the faces get STUCK LIKE THAT !

Research is pending, but one somewhat effective way to defeat these vile =
creatures (the human ones) is to "steal their nose". The humans then, =
bewildered at their lost nose, run around blindly until they literally =
run in circles trying to find it. . . twisting their heads off of their =
own necks. . .=20

sounds crazy. . . it IS !

really tho,=20
it is everywhere. It can be transmitted from consuming products from =
infected cows. It's also been known to effect other animals.

Aparrently it takes 10-15+ years for someone to show effects from the =
disease. The disease causes holes to literally be eaten in the human =
brain and exhibits symptoms completely alike with the well known =
"Alzheimers Disease" (thats prolly not spelled right). Basically until =
the individual becomes a vegetable (not literally).

I think I heard Mr Bushy say that its not a big deal.

I guess if he did, TONS of businesses and a HUGE economy based on cow =
products would be disabled. Its sad how the motives of personal gain =
damage the life of so many people just cuz of lil things like anarchy, =
disaster, and riots n such. . .=20

so many people say (fuckerz), "what they don't know wont hurt em".

I havent eaten any type of meat in years. . .almost vegan except for ice =
cream and cheese (sometimes).
Never too soon to start !

guess it'd suck to say like "I wish I never ate that steak back in texas =
fifteen years ago". . . but I suppose by then you really wouldn't be =
able to say much at all. But hey, drool n slobber can say things regular =
words just never could. . .  like my bro Homer. . =
."aarrrggghhuuuuuugggguuuuu". . . .

so the moral of the story. . .
"evolution makes em smarter, but only us people can really make cows =
madd"

"California. . . it might've been the cheese !"

: )

isn't fun to be able to witness the worlds destruction first hand ? Damn =
i'm gonna be jealous of my kids someday. . . the fun they'll have.

I would have to agree with you on that.  Ever since "The Movement" back in the early 90's, I have the upmost respect for Richard "Humpty" Vission.  A lot of his stuff with Pete Lorimer around 96' was kick butt too.  "We're about to take you on a trip!!!"

I mean.. he's a bad ass producer, he produced this Album Pure Sugar that I Love, he produced DJ Mea in this song which is So Dope, & he mixes really good as well as his live set that night @ 550! He's also a nice Cat...

I don't understand how him being here in SF on NYs is corny... He's a really good guy!

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Saturday, January 17, 2004 ** Cold Phusion Winter Music Festival by BR
Productions, Next Level Promotions, and KCRH 89.9FM **

 he COLD PHUSION Winter Music Festival! Line-up TEASER!!! COLD PHUSION
will feature over 40+ Artists performing on 4 MASSIVE stages of sound! THE
WARP BROS: The legendary Warp Brothers - DJ's Oliver Goedicke and J=FCrgen
Dohr. It did not take a long time and their first single Phatt Bass hit
the German market and made it to the top 3 in the dance charts! Shortly
after this they entered the Sales-Charts Europe wide up to the #2! No
wonder that they draw the music business attention, with placing a solid
techno-track in the sales-charts.Shortly after their uplifting style
flooded Europe, the wave swept over to the US, Canada, Australia and
Japan. You might somehow compare the style of the Warp Brothers to Prodigy
or Chemical Brothers but the truth is that they created their own creative
and unique sound, like you can read in an article of the Face magazine.
Although the Warp Brothers are friendly people - they are in possession of
a lethal weapon, which is called Harder House. Remarkable is their success
in the UK sales-charts #9 and Top 10 positions in several Sales -Charts.In
Denmark they were rewarded with gold. Undoubted the Warpies as they are
keenly called by their fans turn it up on stage! DJ DRC: San Francisco's
Pioneer DJ DRC has relocated to New York City and is geared up to take the
Electronic Music Industry by storm. With her Mixed Album "UNDEFINED" in
the works and a list of releases on IMIX, Vision Music, Off World, Merge,
Twin Soul and her own label Undefined Musik, DRC equivocates the
expeditious pace of her new stomping grounds. Her original music is also
featured in two movies, "Vision of Vibe" with Carl Cox and "Intellect"
being released this February 2003, featuring Paul Van Dyk and many others.
DRC's latest single SEEKER can be heard on the SPANKEE clothing line
websight. With all this under her belt and more, it is obvious DRC has
already had her finger on the pulse of the Big Apple/ Manhattan. DRC
Returns to S.F. for a special set at COLD PHUSION! PLUS MORE CALIFORNIA

SOMA Sessions Fourth Fridays @ AsiaSF

For the inaugural session we bring you, all the way from Manchester UK,
the sounds of:

MARCUS INTALEX (Soul:r, MIST - UK)  Marcus Intalex is known across the
globe for his infectious, smooth style of Drum 'n Bass. Only a few years
after his first production efforts in 1995 on Flex and his own Intalex
Productions imprint came anthems such as "How You Make Me Feel," "Love &
Happiness" and "Universe," which firmly positioned Marcus as one of the
world's top D&B personalities. Today, Marcus and longtime studio partner,
S.T. Files continue to blaze trails as M.I.S.T. with their wildly popular
Soul:r label. With over a decade of experience on the decks, SOMA Sessions
is proud to welcome back to San Francisco one of the UK's most in-demand
Drum 'n Bass DJs.

METHOD ONE (Cov.Ops, method-one.com)  By 1994 Method One was both an
acclaimed DJ and and experienced rave promoter in Philly. By 1996 he was
also an established producer. Recording with partner Kaos as Atlantiq,
Method One signed tunes to labels like Good Looking and True Intent while
holding down DJ residencies at Konkrete Jungle and Dieselboy's Platinum.
Since relocating to the Bay, Jason continues to wreck dancefloors with his
diverse DJ sets and release top-shelf tunes on labels such as ASC's Covert
Operations.

new format from the grange....now, we all know that
anyone with any sense or any sort of a social life has
plans for the new year...actually, the more you plan
each and every milli-second, the less actual time you
have for anything that doesn't suit your
sensibilities...we feel lucky that there is only this
much time and nothing more here...countdown
begins....how many days left? depends on your
perspective....live to party...:)

A lot of DJs that aren't headliners in their own city are huge outside of
it...for instance, I'm blowing up in Idaho right now.  I'm all the way up to
a booking fee of three sacks of potatoes, four if it's a Saturday gig.

Seriously, SF itself has names that people here have barely heard of that
tour the world.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Uhh.. Richard Humpty Vision as a headliner?


Damn that 'geigh house' music.

So when's anabolic frolic coming to SF?!?

:P :P :P~ phhbt!

At least SF is just mired in bad prog house and trance. :) It could be
worse. I can see Dannyboy explosively shitting his pants and taking half
the bay with him if it was AF instead of humptydumpty headlining. ;)

Speaking of which, however... I've been listening to a lot of old hardcore
and breaks recently... This' got me thinkin'. I'm too young and too much
of a n00b to have been around for the 'golden age' of 92-95... but does it
occur to anyone that the reason for the lack of energy/vis/whathaveyou in
parties recently is just because the music has changed so drastically? You
listen to some of the older electronic music, and there's just so much
*energy* there (no matter how cheesy the choons..) that you just don't get
in a lot of modern music. Maybe our tastes got too refined for our own
good? Don't get me wrong -- the music out there now is refined,
high-quality, max-produced *quality* music... but maybe in our rush to be
refined artiste`s we've really lost some of the basic energy of raves?

A lot of the music out there right now (aside from jungle, where the vibe
is just... directionless and angry, and techno, which ... well, is techno)
seems to be either amped drug music (coming in fluffy etard trance, speedy
gonzales hardcore, etc) or 'get your groove on' sleazegrind-moozic, best
suited to sipping cocktails and trying to get into them panties at your
local clubaroonie. What happened to all that ENERGY that was in the music
even 6, 7 years ago? Is it the DJs, is it the producers, is it just that
this is the kind of music the crowds want?

Is it that the low-fi nature of electronic music, before we started
superproducing everything down to a razor edge, was more condusive to
getting people on their feet? Maybe there was more for people to connect
with? Imperfection makes the art, and all that?

Maybe I'm just gettin' jaded. But as time passes, the music I hear at
parties seems less and less danceable. The crazy little undergrounds seem
to be waning, replaced with the mass-produced shrinkwrapped rave
experience. Maybe I'm outta the loop. Maybe I'm not doing enough drugs.
But what the fuck is going on?

Don't get me wrong. I've been to a few great parties recently. But, you
know.. a *few*. The music seems a little less lively, the crowds are a
little more bitchy, nerves seem a little more raw. Maybe I'm just seeing a
reflection of the country as a whole?

But where them smilin' faces? Where that thumptythump oontz oontz
dancypantsy whooplah?

this is your rambling nonsense for the day.

I'm too young and too much
of a n00b to have been around for the 'golden age' of 92-95... but does =
it
occur to anyone that the reason for the lack of energy/vis/whathaveyou =
in
parties recently is just because the music has changed so drastically?
..

nope... it's that half the tech jobs in the bay were suddently gone, and =
the other half took pay cuts.  all tech centers around the world =
experienced the same... then it took a few years to really hit the rest =
of the world through trickle-down.  now we're on the rock bottom.  it's =
all uphill from here.

once people are back to working 60hrs a week, making bank, and needing =
to seriously release during those few remaining hours of the week, =
wellfare not being an issue... you'll see more parties, more music, more =
smiling faces.

it will never be quite the same as those years. we can only improve from =
here... but it will take some evolution.

Holy shit, I didn't know Mark Almaria had a name of any kind outside of
Chicago!  I grew up on that kid, he played at over half the parties I went
to my first couple years of ravin'.  Just saw him hangin out yesterday too,
no more fat pants.  :(  He used to play all the underground jams and hits
for us kiddies.  Where do you know him from?

i've always gotten good results by going, in person, to property 
management & real estate offices and asking for their new rental 
listings.

if you get there right when they open, you'll be the first to see 
anything that's available. most places will let you take the key and 
check out the house if you leave a $20 deposit with them.

i know this isn't as easy as an online listing, but it's way more 
effective, and free.

but if you insist on an online listing, i'd recommend metrorent, rent 
tech, or something similar. there are a few in the bay area. for about 
$70 (for 3 months) you get emailed updates of new rentals, and you can 
log in and look up photos and other info. and, after you find your 
place, you can always give your subscription to someone else to use.

hope this helps.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Uhh.. Richard Humpty Vision as a headliner?

Well for starters in 92 the Scene had just gotten to SF a year earlier.. I 
recall parties in 91 being the small UG parties and the first Gatherings and 
FTT parties etc.. by 92 the "Scene" was in full swing it was NEW FRESH and 
if you recall in 91-92 you could do all night dance parties in the city of 
SF perfectly Legally!! which you can not do now or probably will able to do 
again.. At least not at no shady warehouse on any giving street in SF. Some 
of you remember the charter oak days, 16@harrison, Jose's Latin Palace, 
8@townsend etc... And I have some old tapes from back then. Bang the drum, 
Ghetto Gangsta, No rest for the wicked old Carlos and Bones tapes etc.. and 
I wouldn't say the music was better then just different. Some of it is kind 
of weak in terms of production when you compare it to similiar toones of 
today. I mean look at the rave classics.. Liberty citys "Get some luvin" 
Granted it is a good toon but very minimal and weak by comparison. Yet at 
the time it was a big toon. Or DJ Dukes "Wheres my whistle" Which I still 
own a copy of. Every major DJ from the wicked boys to the hardkiss boys were 
banging that toon at that time and if you listen to it today it doesn't have 
that same energy, it was the crowd that had the energy that accompanied the 
track. In addition alot of those old producers that made famous Rave anthems 
back then are still producing tracks till this day they have just evolved 
there sound.

For instance I just found out the other day that Jon Debo was responsible 
for the "Mind warp" tracks on stress.. And if any of you were a DJ or 
followed the wicked boys back in the early 90's they use to play alot of the 
stress tracks including mindward 1 and II same with alot of the old Junior 
boys own and stress guys.

Not exactly sure where I was going with my rant but you get the picture ;)

Alot of factors have changed and made the scene what it is today but one 
thing we can all still agree on is that the simple fact is it is still 
GOING!! more then 12 years or longer if you follow it back to the disco 
history of this subculture being around. That is a pretty good feet 
considering most sub cultures have died out and are now coming back 
Punkers,breakers etc.. So for it to sustain for so long is pretty impressive 
consedering all the obsticles it has had to face.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

I will post a lot more about how Georgia went and it will be way more 
understand than this gibberish i am fixing to type :-)

well for Christmas i went to Georgia to see my granny and grand dad both 
sides of the family it was so grate i felt so like a little kid. well anyway on 
the airplane i was getting down on my GBA (game boy advance) i got the game 
Mario Kart, and Super Mario Advance 4 (Super Mario Bros. 3)  old school game. i 
was playing it for 4 1/2 hours on the airplane ride. wow was it grate, the best 
Nintendo games i played when i was a young kid now on a hand held "SWEET"

But OK the real question I want to know is what games do I need now?

i have these

Mario Kart 
Super Mario Advance 4 (Super Mario Bros. 3) 
defender
The Sims (bustin out)
Golden Sun 
Dragon Ball Z - Taiketsu
Fire Pro Wrestling (1)
GT3 Advance

OK so the thing I want to know is what would be a good graphics wise game to 
buy and also what are some dope games that you all played on GBA and why 
should I buy them. I trust you all because we are all rave friends in heart and 
there is nothing wrong with that :-) 

Hm... do you think there will be a Beat / Dance, Dance Revolution game out 
for the GBA? Kind of like the ones in the arcade?

And is there good mod's I need for the GBA?

Will the GRAPHICS get better with games to come?

And where are good websites for up coming GBA games?

Amen to all that!!!

I wasn't around for the REALLY old school either.  But even in the few 
years *I* have been around, I've noticed a distinct souring of the vibe 
at parties, a loss of energy, and a loss of the blissful happiness that 
first got me hooked into SF's rave scene.  Even happy hardcore, when 
you hear it at a party, doesn't sound "happy" anymore.  And it's not 
JUST a jadedness or depression in myself... the music is more 
aggressive and less cheerful.  Sure, it was corny as hell to hear 
Shooting Star and Eye Opener at every party, and usually more than once 
at said parties... but it was FUN, dammit.

And thanks to Ishkur's guide to electronic music:

http://www.ishkur.com/features/music/index.htm

I've been looking into even older genres lately... the very same ones 
you're talking about, I think... stuff that dates all the way back to 
when I got myself dragged to my first few raves in Florida, hated them, 
and vowed that I'd never go to another...

So, along with Jpop, this "Old School" stuff has been at the top of my 
downloading lists, of late.  And I'm loving it all, uber-cheezy and 
all.  I'm talking about the sort of stuff you see in those old "This is 
Old School" and "This is Rave" boxed sets... stuff like *OLD* Moby, 
before whatever happened that set him on his depressive music thing; 
stuff like "Next is the E", "Voodoo Child", "Go", and so on... stuff 
like OLD Prodigy... stuff like Altern 8's "Activ 8"; which is just so 
corny as to be horrible; it's like the stuff that they play in the 
Arena when a basketball team runs out to the court.

None of it is "refined".  It's not the sort of stuff that the hipster 
martini-sipping crowd would ever denign to listen to.  Like the Jpop, 
which I am also coming to just love, it is horribly corny and cheezy.  
It's not "mature" music by a long shot.  The very vinyl it's pressed on 
would probably shatter if you tried to take it past the threshold of 
SOMAarts or the Tenderloft.

But, also like Jpop, it is FUN!!!  It's cheerful and optimistic.  It's 
bright.  It's happy.  It's high in energy, gets my heart racing, and if 
I ever found a party where they'd play it, it would damn well get me 
MOVING, in a way no party has in a long time.  And I think that kind of 
joy, cheer, and unbounded optimism is what's been missing in the scene 
for quite some time.


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] Why energy seems missing (was Re: Richard Humpty Vision...)

	I think there's some truth to what both Dave and Sean say. A thriving 
countercultural needs an abundance of leisure time, which means that 
the economy must be strong enough that most people aren't spending most 
of their time simply working to pay rent and put food on the table. One 
of the factors behind the countercultural explosion that took place in 
the late 1960s in SF was very cheap rents in the Haight-Ashbury (this 
was before the era of rent control and other government regulations 
that drove up the cost of housing in SF).

	Nevertheless, Sean's original post about a correlation between the 
music and the energy level of raves was insightful. But I would say 
that the music becoming more produced and polished, and with less happy 
energy, is a *result* of the scene changing, not the cause. You could 
have a party with all early techno/trance, and you wouldn't necessarily 
get the same vibe you had with that music in 1993. We can still have 
raves with that overflowing positive energy, but I don't think the 
answer will be found in the music.

Groove on,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Uhh.. Richard Humpty Vision as a headliner?


Damn that 'geigh house' music.

So when's anabolic frolic coming to SF?!?

:P :P :P~ phhbt!

At least SF is just mired in bad prog house and trance. :) It could be
worse. I can see Dannyboy explosively shitting his pants and taking half
the bay with him if it was AF instead of humptydumpty headlining. ;)

Speaking of which, however... I've been listening to a lot of old 
hardcore
and breaks recently... This' got me thinkin'. I'm too young and too much
of a n00b to have been around for the 'golden age' of 92-95... but does 
it
occur to anyone that the reason for the lack of energy/vis/whathaveyou 
in
parties recently is just because the music has changed so drastically? 
You
listen to some of the older electronic music, and there's just so much
*energy* there (no matter how cheesy the choons..) that you just don't 
get
in a lot of modern music. Maybe our tastes got too refined for our own
good? Don't get me wrong -- the music out there now is refined,
high-quality, max-produced *quality* music... but maybe in our rush to 
be
refined artiste`s we've really lost some of the basic energy of raves?

A lot of the music out there right now (aside from jungle, where the 
vibe
is just... directionless and angry, and techno, which ... well, is 
techno)
seems to be either amped drug music (coming in fluffy etard trance, 
speedy
gonzales hardcore, etc) or 'get your groove on' sleazegrind-moozic, best
suited to sipping cocktails and trying to get into them panties at your
local clubaroonie. What happened to all that ENERGY that was in the 
music
even 6, 7 years ago? Is it the DJs, is it the producers, is it just that
this is the kind of music the crowds want?

Is it that the low-fi nature of electronic music, before we started
superproducing everything down to a razor edge, was more condusive to
getting people on their feet? Maybe there was more for people to connect
with? Imperfection makes the art, and all that?

Maybe I'm just gettin' jaded. But as time passes, the music I hear at
parties seems less and less danceable. The crazy little undergrounds 
seem
to be waning, replaced with the mass-produced shrinkwrapped rave
experience. Maybe I'm outta the loop. Maybe I'm not doing enough drugs.
But what the fuck is going on?

Don't get me wrong. I've been to a few great parties recently. But, you
know.. a *few*. The music seems a little less lively, the crowds are a
little more bitchy, nerves seem a little more raw. Maybe I'm just 
seeing a
reflection of the country as a whole?

But where them smilin' faces? Where that thumptythump oontz oontz
dancypantsy whooplah?

this is your rambling nonsense for the day.

It seems to be a constant in the scene that right now isn't as good
as 3-5 years back, when the music was fresher, better, (etc).
When I got in it '93, people were already saying this. And they
still are!

I wonder what makes it so?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Uhh.. Richard Humpty Vision as a headliner?

Usually when people say it was better back in the day, they're referring to
whenever they started partying.  They do it for a couple years, things
shift, everything's not as new anymore, and they long for one of those first
few magic party experiences.  How often do you hear anyone say, "it's even
better now than back in the day" about anything?  Nostalgia, remember the
best, filter out the rest.

It depends if one can provide objective truth about it being better or not
being better.  Sure, nostalgia plays a part in everything, but the delta
between
"it was amazing" and "it sucks" is large, and there seems to be a large
number
of people in this camp over the past 4 years vs. "it was better" and "it's
not
as good".  The later being nostalgia.  Do you really think there's only
nostalgia
as a factor?  I don't.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Uhh.. Richard Humpty Vision as a headliner?

i dunno - i'm having more fun now than i did "back in the day".

but my personal involvement in partying has changed as well.  i
started out "just partying", then helping flyer for parties,
helping set up parties, helping/throwing my own, and now
DJing/throwing my own.

doing the same old thing year after year gets boring.  do
something new - contribute in some way.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Subject: [sfraves] DJ named: No Left Turn (spinning on NYE?)

Hey,
This is NOT a page message--I don't need to talk to the DJ.

Just wondering if No Left Turn is spinning this week for a NYE party somewhere.

Typically, he spins happy hardcore and I thought that I saw a BSP in my inbox last week listing this DJ.

Thanks,
Greg VP

I do think much of the emphasis lately in music production and delivery has 
been on refinement of technique rather than innovation.   Much of this 
music lacks...well...soul:)  Lineups for parties are based on some rather 
rigid genre paradigms and many DJs seem to be heavily invested in 
maintaining these status quo boundaries in their sets.

We have all been attempting to meet what we think are the expectations of 
our dancers, but just meeting expectations ultimately leads to boredom and 
mediocrity.

Experimentation and innovation is, however, risky for both the party-giver, 
DJ and producer.  There is comfort in the tried and true.  Things are 
changing, however, and I feel this yearning for less "mechanistic" dance 
music in many dancers.  I am always surprised, for example, at the 
enthusiastic reception Jesse Saunders receives when he spins here.  Jesse 
does love house passionately, and when he throws down some of those soulful 
old tunes the crowd goes wild.  I personally miss vocals and meaningful 
lyrics and use of instruments like the sax in house music.  These days I 
have been looking back on the last twenty years of EDM for inspiration and 
so, apparently have others.  Something wonderful will arise from all this, 
and that's the way it has always been.  Coincidentally, I am having an 
ongoing email conversation with Greg Wilson of UK electrofunk fame on this 
very subject.  There are revivals of all kinds of older musical 
styles;  the stuff is remixed;  new genres evolve.  About time.

The conditions that exist now are pretty much the same as those that 
defined the early days of raving:  war with Iraq;  poor economy; and lots 
of darkness connected with mortality (AIDS, etc.) and uncertainty about the 
future.  On a personal level, life seemed far more risky then than 
now.  Musically, though, there was anarchy -- not the genre structure we 
have now.  DJs played eclectic sets and would bounce from house to 
industrial to punk and back.  Some of it would be considered sloppy today, 
but there was energy.  And by god the new music started flowing and the 
party scene exploded.  It wasn't money that drove it all, but a desire 
amongst many of the participants to make new connections on the dance floor 
and experience personal transformation.  Consider this little piece from 
the Raver Manifesto:


"We were first drawn by the sound. From far away, the thunderous, muffled, 
echoing beat was comparable to a mother's heart soothing a child in her 
womb of concrete, steel, and electrical wiring. We were drawn back into 
this womb, and there, in the heat, dampness, and darkness of it, we came to 
accept that we are all equal. Not only to the darkness, and to ourselves, 
but to the very music slamming into us and passing through our souls: we 
are all equal. And somewhere around 35Hz we could feel the hand of God at 
our backs, pushing us forward, pushing us to push ourselves to strengthen 
our minds, our bodies, and our spirits. Pushing us to turn to the person 
beside us to join hands and uplift them by sharing the uncontrollable joy 
we felt from creating this magical bubble that can, for one evening, 
protect us from the horrors, atrocities, and pollution of the outside 
world. It is in that very instant, with these initial realizations that 
each of us was truly born."

Many came to parties with this intentionality in mind and soul.  I still 
do:)  Nothing really new here.  This statement could have described the 
shared feelings of the dancers at the Paradise Garage in 70's NYC.  As 
raving moved into the mainstream in the late nineties I think much of this 
community of shared belief was replaced by "...it's just entertainment;  a 
way to blow off steam from a 24/6 work week."

But this shared dancers' belief in the transformative power or music and 
dance -- the quality that makes for those smilin' faces and wooplah -- is 
still out there.  I find it in the most unlikely places these days.  Yes, 
there is dissatisfaction with things as they are but one hell of a lot of 
people are looking for that old, ancient, vibe.  And they will find it, 
because it is they who will create our future.  No one can deliver the 
spirit to you.  You bring it to the mix.  These disaffected dancers will 
find their soul mates and something new and wonderful will begin.  Ah...it 
already has:)

Love,

Apollo

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Your First Party

My first in the bay was in 1994 or 1993 at Berkley Square some show with
Carlos and a few other SF locals. I wish I could remember the name but I
did not even have a flyer. Later one of my memorable shows was at the
party where Basics and Organic became one crew. That was in 1994 some
time. My first ever party was in Tucson AZ in 1992 it was called Toon
Town it was held in downtown Tucson. Damn madness

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Your First Party

I'm a relative noob, so...

My first "rave" was Cyberfest in summer 2000 on Fresno.  Every DJ and
their mom played at that, but some of the headliners were Oakenfold, BT,
and Aphrodite.

My first real party was in January 2001 in a little "community center" up
in Woodland.  I don't remember the event's name or who threw it, and the
turnout was pretty minimal, but Deepsky headlined and they rocked.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Your First Party - found info

:)  i tracked down some info about my first party, found it on the Silver Pearl website.
Quest, Nov 14, 1998, at the JJ Newberry store on Broadway in Oakland. 
Upstairs: Eric Spire, Jeno, Garth, Tracy, Tony
Downstairs: Mystre, JBot, Greg Sandler, and a 3-hr set by Doran (I was wrong about there being a jungle room, but all the music was new to me and I didn't know the styles)
Mark Johns did animations and projections on 3 screens. UV99 did lasers. Total of about 2000 people. There were edible altars, and this beautiful entry made of tree branches and flowers. 
No wonder I was en-tranced!  (totally sober, too). I'd love to hear from anybody who was at that party. Quest parties were something special; I believe I went to two more of them which were held at Home Base. 

At a Trance & Jungle party (Thomas Trouble) not too long after at the JJ Newberry store, I heard the main floor collapsed, sending dust and concrete onto the heads of the dancers below. I didn't hear about anybody getting hurt but i'm sure it messed up a few highs. Anybody go to that one?  ow. 

looking forward to hearing about other peoples' first rave.  :)
John

Spanks!  Then I guess my first party in SF was at an S&M club on Folsom in 
the seventies:)

Before I moved to SF permanently in the late eighties from NYC I made 
several extended visits to the City in the seventies.  In 1979 I came out 
here for three months in the summer to soak up the sex and sensuality and 
spin some New York disco at the Troc.  The first dance party I attended I 
kinda' stumbled into one night while touring the Castro.

Back then the Castro was nothing like the dead commercial strip it is 
today.  In the seventies there were many dance clubs, sex venues and a 24/7 
party atmosphere in the Castro/Market area.  As I was doing a little 
discovery tour one Saturday night soon after my arrival I wandered into a 
dance club called Alfie's on Market.  The place was on fire.  Everyone was 
dancing, including the bartenders and staff.  Great vibe.  The music was, 
of course, disco and I have no idea who the DJs were.  But I still remember 
that evening fondly.

My first "rave" here was a Wicked FMR in '91 on Baker Beach.  THAT was a 
truly transformative experience:)

Love,

Apollo

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving: Your First Party

hmm lets see date  Oct-??-1991
Event name: hmmm don't recall it was so long ago.. Location One step beyond 
in Santa Clara.
DJ lineup I think I still have the flyer but lets see it was Buck,Lily 
Tron,Bones,Markie Mark,Ghost
And some locals like Thief and some others..  Who knows who the crew was.. 
But I did get my first ever "IF" shirt at that party and Some GAT and SPIN 
gear.. Back when rave apparel was becoming the rage.. The party was semi 
weak by todays standards but it was a going on crowd with a hot sweaty quasi 
two room setup but with a nice big thick green laser that was super cool and 
the sound was super loud  :) Stayed for a few hours then had to go home 
cause I could not take the music all night.. hahahh funny how things turn 
out  ;)

How many of you can remember the "Elmo line"  ?

If you remember him and that line you get props you are old skewl!! I think 
it might predate the "buzzline" but im sure Vlad would prove me wrong and 
say his line was up way before his. But everyone I knew called the elmo 
line..

roger that!!

My first was a Quests party at homebase ...........

The thing i remember best was parking accross the street,watching hordes of
peeps dressed in the crazy of craziest cross in all directions.When i
crossed they had one of the big ass roll up doors like halfway open and you
could see the mass of peeps dancing and the lasers & music busting out all
over the place.Then we walked around the back where i stayed in line for
almost 2 hours.That was the craziest of all LINE EXPERIENCES......LOL.I
could write a book just about the shit you hear in line.Anyways,after
getting in there were the fruit alters and a ton of decorations.The kewlist
pawty ive been to of this kind fo sho.The one thing that sticks out also was
the music.It seems to me that that time or era of the rave scenes music was
intense.I still have many mix tapes i have from a couple years ago that have
alot of those most common trax or hits that were popular and still blow me
away.Is it just me or has the music changed that much?I luv to hear new
stuff but it just dont thrill me like it did.Long live EDM & Silver
Pearl!...................

P.S. I had just turned 33,moved from LA,a dancerphobic and was a HUGE 80's
metal head.Go figure...............

I don't know how much of this is right, but here goes:
 
All Together Now
It cost $5 and was in an empty house in Berkeley around 6th and Addison. I had recently moved to the Bay area, and I can't even remeber how I found out about an underground party. I think some of the djs were daz and marty? The system was in the second floor of the house and the needle kept skipping cause everyone was grooving so hard.
 
I got arrested that night. I'm pretty sure it was February 1995.

heheh...i was actually going to be going to planet new year because i was 
going to be playing AT planet new year.

but now i'm not.  so my raving ass is heading to infinite beat where i will 
be acting like a dweeb dancing all night long and hopefully make out with 
some random person at midnight and gettting jiggy to music that goes "boom 
boom thump boom thump boom boom" and if my brain isn't churned to mashed 
potatoes by sunrise i may drag my limp lifeless body over to somarts for the 
anonsalon afterparty that goes on til the afternoon.

there's no better way to ring in the new year!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr, whats the name for: that classified list board. . . uuuhh

hey thanks

I found out I had better search results when I used google and searched for
"property management" rather than "rentals", or "homes for rent".

There was a place a few houses down from my budd. . .he pays like 900/mo,
and the management peeps wanted 1500 for the same style house. . .

I could easily get an apartment I'm sure, but I have like 2 cars, a car
trailer, and a mc trailer. . . I guess if I need to I can stick with storage
n all, but it would limit my mechanical hobbies / business activities and
such if I didn't have a ton of space to work with.

I almost had a live-in wherehouse which was huge for like 650/mo (which
would have been totally perfect), but I was too slow. I'll keep looking in
that area and maybe I'll get lucky talking to someone else who hates
management companies or something like that.

thanks for the help mann

take care of yourself

aK

Count me out.   If someone's foolish enough to drop their ticket on the
floor from a flight from Miami, I don't want to be part of their
reality.  No matter how much they brag about the cost of their
production.

And for the CW people in the list, I am the Jesus lookin dood who was on
the flight from Miami in '02.  Bite me.  Try to put some heart in your
shit and you might have something.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Haha.  I was just discussing BG stuff not half an hour ago and so I had
a hair up my ass WTR promoter fucks like CW.  I don't give a rats ass if
you spent 20K on having a wall of video monitors and 10K on security.
Even having a final BG experience of seeing him yelling at the deadheads
in the parking lot at Shorline about how "they didn't make" him can't
diminish him in my eyes as a promoter compared to how so many people
view the promotion scene today.  Thus my animocity towards the rest of
the crowd, Clear Channel type fucks as they are.  Try putting some real
heart into the production, and making sure the sound is as good as it
can be (i.e. try four channel sound rather than moving a stack 10 feet
back so that you can "maximize the space."  (Right JK Sound? ;) )

OK, can anybody tell that I'm a little pissed off about quality?  I'm
going to leave it at that and hope that people wake up, even though the
current "30 seconds of TV indoctrination" doesn't give me much hope, I
STILL have SOME left inside of me.  I'm hoping some others have the
wherewithall to tell the appropriate people that they don't have the
right to drink their spiddle.

hear this year. A 2.5 watt full color laser, the old-skool master Donovan on 
visuals, and lighting by Shock Therapy, Radiant Atmospheres and the Infinite 
Beat will provide an insane amount of visual eye-candy and complement decor 
by Marin, Carrie, Julia, and friends. We'll also be featuring some of the 
cleanest and clearest sound in the Bay Area, including a special 4-corner 
Know:Audio sound system (with Bassmaxx technology), the original Gateway 
Sound System, and Soundwave Systems. Musically, the lineup speaks for 
itself:

Saturday, January 10, 2004 ** Capricorn presented by Elektrosorcery **

Capricorn, whose constellation is known as Capricornus, is one of the
oldest of the astrological interpretations. Ruled by Saturn, its symbol is
the goat. This is sometimes depicted as a sea borne hybrid or Dolphin. The
image is often an animal with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish.
In one tradition the image represents the god Pan transforming into a sea
creature. A representation, perhaps, of the extremities found within this
Astrological sign. The Capricornian is generally a serious character
possessing a wry sense of humor. Independent, steady as a rock, Capricorn
reflects earthy qualities that range from clever to vacuous. Mostly
cautious, confident, strong willed, reasonable and hard working,
Capricorns are a rock upon which to build.They are capable of great
endurance; a whatever it takes, for as long as it takes persistence.
Reliable in any profession they undertake, but lacking in originality,
they usually excel in following up on what someone else has started. With
Capricorn DJs: DYLOOT, UPHONIC, COVERT, SUNDANCE KID, and more to be
announced. $10 presale $15 at the door.

Saturday, January 17, 2004 ** Cold Phusion Winter Music Festival by BR
Productions, Next Level Promotions, and KCRH 89.9FM **

 he COLD PHUSION Winter Music Festival! Line-up TEASER!!! COLD PHUSION
will feature over 40+ Artists performing on 4 MASSIVE stages of sound! THE
WARP BROS: The legendary Warp Brothers - DJ's Oliver Goedicke and J=FCrgen
Dohr. It did not take a long time and their first single Phatt Bass hit
the German market and made it to the top 3 in the dance charts! Shortly
after this they entered the Sales-Charts Europe wide up to the #2! No
wonder that they draw the music business attention, with placing a solid
techno-track in the sales-charts.Shortly after their uplifting style
flooded Europe, the wave swept over to the US, Canada, Australia and
Japan. You might somehow compare the style of the Warp Brothers to Prodigy
or Chemical Brothers but the truth is that they created their own creative
and unique sound, like you can read in an article of the Face magazine.
Although the Warp Brothers are friendly people - they are in possession of
a lethal weapon, which is called Harder House. Remarkable is their success
in the UK sales-charts #9 and Top 10 positions in several Sales -Charts.In
Denmark they were rewarded with gold. Undoubted the Warpies as they are
keenly called by their fans turn it up on stage! DJ DRC: San Francisco's
Pioneer DJ DRC has relocated to New York City and is geared up to take the
Electronic Music Industry by storm. With her Mixed Album "UNDEFINED" in
the works and a list of releases on IMIX, Vision Music, Off World, Merge,
Twin Soul and her own label Undefined Musik, DRC equivocates the
expeditious pace of her new stomping grounds. Her original music is also
featured in two movies, "Vision of Vibe" with Carl Cox and "Intellect"

Friday, January 23, 2004 ** SOMA Sessions w/Marcus Intalex **

SOMA Sessions Fourth Fridays @ AsiaSF

For the inaugural session we bring you, all the way from Manchester UK,
the sounds of:

MARCUS INTALEX (Soul:r, MIST - UK)  Marcus Intalex is known across the
globe for his infectious, smooth style of Drum 'n Bass. Only a few years
after his first production efforts in 1995 on Flex and his own Intalex
Productions imprint came anthems such as "How You Make Me Feel," "Love &
Happiness" and "Universe," which firmly positioned Marcus as one of the
world's top D&B personalities. Today, Marcus and longtime studio partner,
S.T. Files continue to blaze trails as M.I.S.T. with their wildly popular
Soul:r label. With over a decade of experience on the decks, SOMA Sessions
is proud to welcome back to San Francisco one of the UK's most in-demand
Drum 'n Bass DJs.

METHOD ONE (Cov.Ops, method-one.com)  By 1994 Method One was both an
acclaimed DJ and and experienced rave promoter in Philly. By 1996 he was
also an established producer. Recording with partner Kaos as Atlantiq,
Method One signed tunes to labels like Good Looking and True Intent while
holding down DJ residencies at Konkrete Jungle and Dieselboy's Platinum.
Since relocating to the Bay, Jason continues to wreck dancefloors with his
diverse DJ sets and release top-shelf tunes on labels such as ASC's Covert
Operations.

Friday, February 6, 2004 ** *Oneiromancy* presented by Oneiromancy **

Doing things different from other crews, admission to this event will be
free of charge. We are working on the lineup, but as with all our events,
we want to extend a special invite to all the new DJs who have never
played an event. We are setting aside a number of timeslots, in various
genres, so if you are dying to get out there to play, email me at
wavelength_sf@yahoo.com, with the subject "Oneiromancy" Be sure to include
contact info, links to demos (if you have one), and genre. I know everyone
plays every genre, but if you could limit it to one, that would help. I'm
going to randomly draw names to play for each genre, so DJs who play a
genre that is under-represented will have a better shot. Its all random: I
dont care if we are friends, enemies, whatever. I'll post the list the day
after christmas, so thats the deadline. Oh yes, and unlike other times,
hardcore DJs will definatly get slots at this party. Hope to see you guys
there. (look for the full lineup the day after christmas. ) More info TBA.

Subject: [sfraves] Thump Radio NYE Marathon...is ON right now...

hi all - just a quick heads up:  for the 2nd year in a row, thump radio's 
house and progressive show on alice@97.3 has been expanded into a 12 hour 
COMMERCIAL FREE n.y.e. marathon.  we started at 5pm, and it keeps on 
thumping until 5am.

from here to midnight it is sexy house and remixes from our very able 
residents, and then from midnight to 5am we unleash some of the best 
progressive sets for a second time on the alice show:

12am - Kepi
1am - Tim Healey
2am - DAVE RALPH superamazingridiculous (my favorite thump prog set EVER)
3am - Jimmy Van M.
4am - Danny Howells

this show has been made possible through the support of spundae and alice so 
thanks to them for making it 12 hours of commercial free dance music!

whenever you get this, if it before 5am on 1.1.04, tune into alice@97.3!!!

peace from thump radio and happy new year!

-brian
