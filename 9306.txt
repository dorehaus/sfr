	I hope this goes through, my server has been down for a couple days...
Anyway I and a friend went over to Cindy's to wait for directions while Apple Pie spun behind us, we had our own personnal DJ.  It was great.
	We left about 2 to arrive at a small grassy field which almost lookedke an amphitheatre at first.  You walk down a small hill to a large stepped
up planter where everyone was hanging out.  Behind it was the field for about
30 feet where there was a small lined pond (kinda like the one in front of
the Washington Monument but smaller) and then behind that was a fountain
underneath a large Romanesque structure.  
	We hung out on the steps and I got to meet alot of you.  Let me see,
there was Geoff White, Bob Ramstadd, Twitch (Mike),  Jessicaand probably
a couple others I can't remember, sorry.  The system arrived by 3:30 and
Garth started his set by 4.  He mixed in a lot of hip hop beats which I 
liked but around 5 his set took off.  Everyone was dancing and up,up, up...
But of course, all good things come to an end, and I saw a cops search light
peer over the hill.  I wonder what he was thinking right about then (ohh
shit look at all these people.)  Several ravers took advantage of the light
and danced in it as their images danced on the trees behind us.  Great 
natural visuals.  Everyone was yellin and clapping to this.  Garth's set 
was gettin so good but then about 20 cars pulled up and out came the police
some with helmets on as if they would need em.  This is when the highest
energy radiated out as we all cheered and clapped to show them what a 
good time we were hoping that they would leave.  
	Of course they didn't and eventually Garth got cut off but the 
beat continued as several people pounded away on their drums, another 
guy wistled away while we all continued dancing and clapping to the beat.
This lasted for atleast 15 minutes till the cops got impatient and stopped
the drummers.  Everyone just hung out a while while word said it was gonna get moved to Candlestick Park.
	I didn't get the chance to go cause I had to get back to Davis, but I
will bet they had fun there too.  Overall it was a great time though of 
course I wish it had lasted longer.
	Hope you all had a good weekend...

Later,
Gioni

some of dj keoki's work.  Namely disco 2000 dbl tape set, but i think that
if there is any thing else that would work too.  

Also in thinking about doing a couple little parties for friends and
friends of friends over the summer.  im having a party soon but due to
space and other problems this can only be a small number of people.  which
is why im thinking about doing a warehouse of a smaller room in a club such
as the basement of 1015 folsom.  anybody got any ideas for either the keoki
tapes or a space (indoors for now later outdoors maybe)

PLEASE RESPOND AT THIS ADDRESS cvoigt@oboe.calpoly.edu  IF YOU REPLY TO

Subject: Mark Lewis @ Portland

Last night's Serenity was in an empty storefront on Portland's near
eastside.

I arrived around 2:30 to find Mark Lewis had just started spinning -- he
did a good techno set with a little housey taste until things closed down
at 4 am -- not exactly sure why it did, but the Portland events I've been
to have all ended early.

About 100 in attendance, and not much activity on the dance floor.  I'd
have had more fun if there had been more people and involvement, but that's
the breaks.  There was a keg and someone was walking around with a big
bottle of booze -- they politely offered some to Mark Lewis and he equally
politely turned it down.  

At the map point, there was this big guy who kind of glowered at me and
was fairly unfriendly when I asked whether it was the right place to pick
up tickets.  When I arrived at the event, this same guy comes over to me
and starts giving me the third degree: You're a cop, aren't you?  What
do you think you're doing here?  Are you from the '60s?  Well, this clown
was drinking and after I told him to get real he sort of turned his
attitude around and became overly friendly-like, allowing as to how he
was drunk and didn't mean anything by it (sure, that's like saying, Oh
i'm so sorry I crosschecked you, on the way to the penalty box :).
There were a couple of skinhead types who were sort mock-fighting on
the dance floor, which was a little worrisome at first because southeast
Portland has a volatile mix of racist and anti-racist skins, but it turned
out to be kind of fun to watch them.  

Afterwards, I talked with Mark Lewis a bit.  Turned out he'd just come up
from LA and had seen Taylor (who did the Sound Factory last night).  Taylor
told him he was a bit jealous Lewis was getting to go to Portland --
apparently we have gained some kind of good rep on the circuit.  Lewis told
me he really enjoyed the space last night because it was small and bust-free
-- "this would have been shut down in two hours max at home," he said.

At this point, I'd say Portland is a scene on the verge of getting it on,
but there are no guarantees.  It's still a very immature scene -- the
continued prevalence of alcohol indicates that strongly enough.  But there
seems to be a growing cadre of dedicated ravers who keep the good vibe
shining through.  A couple good events could really spark things here.
The prospects are enhanced by the relative smallness of the scene and
the generally more progressive attitude of the Portland police.  Although
last night was a completely underground scene, I doubt much would happen
even if LE had shown up.  We're also primed for some outdoor events, and
the good weather is almost here -- generally it doesn't rain at all in
Portland from the end of June to the end of September.

And I have visions of microraves at the Grateful Dead shows at Autzen
Stadium in the end of August and maybe even the Oregon Country Fair :)

Subject: Digital Music Channel Questions and Ponderings.


(1) I heard a rumour that KFJC (89.7) will get a channel on DMC? Any
substantiations? (transubstantiations and other sacrements also
accepted!).

(2) Wouldn't it be cool to get a "rave channel" on DMC -- pay-per-rave
live broadcasts of massive raves into your living room or into smaller
"listening clubs", e.g. places like Cleos, or Auburn, Placerville,
etc... Live, scheduled "big name" DJ appearances, etc. Sales into
"trendy" fashion shops. The ability to set up massive distributed
parties.

Yes, It's a sick thought, but I like it anyways. 

For those of you of an anti-establishment bent, those to which the
above emits the foul stench of that rotting, maggot-infested carcass
you call capitalism... well, how would you go about jacking this sort
of data distribution into an already paid-for system? (other than by
recording hit cd's that are widely listened to).

Comments?

PS: For those of you that don't know, the digital music channel is a
cable-tv like thing that transmits multiple channels of cd-quality
audio into your stereo, via a special decoder box and remote control
unit.

			With Sex All Things Are Possible
 
This paper has been sent to you for good luck.
The original has been worn out from having passed through
the hands of so many people.  It had travelled around the world
70 times.  [Dear Reader:  please keep this count current.  If this
letter falls into your hands after just completing one more
circuit of the world, please add one to the count.]  
The luck has now been sent to you.  You *will* experience
great sex within four days of receiving this letter, provided
you send it on!  Since the copy must tour the world, you must
make twenty copies and send them to others.
 
This is no joke.  Send no money.
 
Classic examples of fortune:
 
	After passing this letter on, a Montana Spinach Control 
Officer got his penis stuck in a cow-milking machine and had 
the longest series of orgasms in his life.  Then he had to have 
his penis removed because the machine was to run until it got 
10 gallons.  The problem was that he had only mailed 19 letters.
 
	John Elliot tried to pick up a prostitute, but, because he broke 
the chain, was picked up by the police instead.  When they searched
his home, they found magazines of little boys which they showed
to his neighbours.
 
	In a suburb of Paris, Don Loray's trousers were ripped by an
unsatisfied erection, 51 days after failing to circulate the letter.
However, before this occured, a condom machine gave him three 
condoms for the price of one.  (Was this the consolation prize?)
 
Also note the following:
 
	General George Patton, who sent the letter on, saw what
he thought was a quarter in the street.  When he bent down to
pick it up, a beautiful woman in a miniskirt walked by, and he
got a great view.
 
	Heywood Daddit, an unemployed chicken choker, received the
letter and forgot that it had to leave his hand within 96 hours.  His
wife then went bowling with his best friend and never returned.
Later, after finding the letter again, he mailed twenty copies.  A 
few days later, he found the woman who would be his next wife, 
and also discovered that his old wife had made love to him like
a dead salmon for all those years!
 
	Alan Fairchild recieved the letter and, not believing, threw 
it away.  Nine days later he spilled hot coffee in his crotch.  He
was scarred for life, and the female plasitic surgeon who worked
on him couldn't stop laughing because it looked like an old man's
stubby little finger!
 
	In 1993 a copy emailed to a young woman in Oakland had some
line-noise and was barely readable, so she did not realize that this 
paragraph applied to her:  She promised herself she would retype the 
letter and send it on, but she put it aside to do later.  She was later
plagued with problems including herpes and other venereal diseases
she contracted in her futile attempts to find Mr. Right at a singles
bar.  This letter did not leave her hands ub 96 hours.  She finally
typed the letter and found a STD specialist with a 10-inch penis.
 
 
*You must distribute at least twenty copies within 96 hours of 
receiving this letter.  Those who do will find their sex lives more
fulfilling.  There is as absolute gaurantee that you will experience
oral sex under moonlight.
 
*Those who do not will be doomed to one night stands with 
appendages, vegetables and mechanical devices.

Yet another wonderful rave to report on...   After a somewhat slow start,
things started hopping around 12:30 or so,   and the music was yet again
out of this world....   The "One Step Beyond" place was certainly an
ideal place.    Plenty of parking,  lots of room,   even the dance floor
wasn't that crowded.    Very cool,   lots of ventilation dipite the
massive amounts of "Chiminys" and chain smokers.  I had plenty of energy,
and could have lasted until 6pm the next day,,, but I did it totally 
DRUG FREE!!

One girl came up to me and said "How old are you?",   I replied
"Older than you can imagine?",   she said "Do you come to many of 
these?".  I said "Always!!".   She says "How can you dance so long?"
I said "I try to conserve my energy!" I spent MOST of my time hobbling 
around the dance floor,   and ran into two dudes from the Net. 
Whoever you are,  please Email me,  I got some info you requested.....

I guess not that many people recognize me yet,   but when June Mondo
comes out,  that may change.

The Chill out room could have used some carpets or soft places to 
flop down on,   but Craig Larson,  and Synergy's Video was truly
"Eye candy".  Really good stuff.   I have to hand it to John Lee,
it was really a great rave.    I found a nice place behind stage to
do my Yoga and stretching between dance sets.    Longest "rest period"
was about 20 minutes,  which says alot about the totally awsome music
sets that kept me on my feet.    My arm and neck is still a bit
"Twitchey" but after raving,  it sure loosened it up.   Feel GREAT!
and is great substitute for Aerobics,  and sure a hell of a lot
more fun.   Thanx all for a very great time,  especially to John Lee,
and Craig Larson....

Lets have more of these,   especially at "One step Beyond".   Wonderful
place...

Cheers --- Keep on raving...

I had a really good time at Vortex, and was pretty impressed with
everything, all told.

It is a bummer to be not allowed to bring in backpacks.  I wasn't
allowed to bring in my blo-pops, or even an empty water bottle.  They
even wanted the stuffing out of my cat-in-the-hat so they could make
sure I didn't have any drugs inside.  Pretty harsh.  Then again, once
inside, I felt safe, quite an accomplishment after witnessing the
pepper gassing incident at the One Step when Child is Born tried to
happen there.

(Of course, it goes without saying that they were charging for water,
given the harsh water bottle policy.)

Great to see everyone who made it, Cindy, Mykl, Brian, and it was nice
to meet Cap'n Crunch and talk to him a bit too.

Yowsa!

In additions to seconding John's excellent reportage, I'd also like to add
that I was totally impressed with OSB and the protomoters.  I remember 
various unwholesome
reports on the place a while back on the list.  When I got to the location
and saw "One Step Beyond", I waited outside a long time to check out the
vibe.  I arrived at or about 2:30, and I saw a stream of people leaving.
I overheard a couple of groups mumbling about there being no more alcohol.

That pleased me no end, and I was encouraged to venture inside.  It was a
great space, a solid vibe (luv phasors were set on 7) and bloody great 
music.  One DJ laid down a thrashing acid set that I totally tranced on.
By about 5, the place had cleared out some, and us dancers were really 
using up the floor space.  The security was good--they didn't confiscate
my luv phasor at all, and the water was free. 

One thing that did concern me was the masses of broken glass (including some
car glass) in the parking lot.  Future promoters may wish to attend to lot
security as well.

On the plus side, I did see the police make a circle through the dance floor,
very polite and courteous, eyes very agog.

All in all, a fine time!

Happy Party people,  please help!

For some time I've been watching your discussions, and it appears that
San Fran is on one hell of a vibe, you've got a sorted scene with a truly
friendly community. It's a pity the same can't be said for many elements in 
London...... 

Anyway, to cut the irrelevant burble, I'm looking to quit England for a long
period of time, and San Fran seems to be the perfect destination. The problem
is getting work visas etc, your gov't aint exactly hot at giving us Green 
Cards :-) So I find myself looking into the possibility of doing a post
graduate course in the states, possibly someting IT or Human Factors based.
(I'm currently doing Human Factors.) So the point of all this is, can someone
please give me some idea of which uni's offer such courses in the Bay area,
surely some of you are involved in this area, I'd be grateful for some idea's.

And if I don't get a place in higher education in the us? well I'm planning
to hit San Fran sometime this summer (finances permitting) and check out
your scene. See if it fits my perception of happy party people dancing the
night away on the beach, with a little man in a corner blowing up balloons
filled with nitrous. :-)

It depends on the state (and there are 50 of them) but basically
if you are 18 but under 21, you can vote in all elections, drive a car,
join the armed forces, get married without parental consent, some stares
allow you to drink 3-2 beer, I don't know if any states allow full drinking
privledges to under 21.

I don't know the exact legality but in practice what you doo in your own
home is OK, now someone who sees this consistantly COULD maybe bring
your dad up on charges of child abuse or "unfit parent"

Technically NO, the restaurant can be fined, but it takes a cop seeing that
to start the bru-ha, it depends on the restaurant, if you say my son/daughter
is having wine, they might refuse, if you just nonchalantly obtain another
glass and start serving your child they will mostlikely pretend they didn't
see you.  I hear French families run into this all the time, and think we
are tremendous hipocrite for it.  Oh you can get lung cancer at 18!

Sorry, I didn't express myself too clearly.  I was just asking about
alcohol laws....

The reason that I asked was that both these two are perfectly legal in
the UK.  If you're under 18, you can't buy alcohol, and you can't
drink alcohol in a bar.  But it's perfectly legal for you to drink at
home, or in a restaurant (but only with a meal)...

I was wondering whether in the US alcohol was more like a controlled
drug (illegal substance) when you're under 21....  like, can you be
done for "possession" of alcohol if you're under 21, for instance...?


  Geoff> Oh you can get lung cancer at 18!

In the UK, you only have to be 16 to buy tobacco....

I'm guilty.  I've already apologized to Chris about it in private
email.

I had problems reading my email Thursday night.

This is actually why in the past I have had Brian send email to two
different accounts for me for the phone tree:

boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com and
rramstad@us.oracle.com

Both are only semi-reliable from home due to problems with my terminal
set up.  It's pretty much essential for the announcement to be sent to
both.  Geoff, your earlier announcements were sent to both addresses,
so I assumed the final location would be sent to both, but for some
reason, I only received it at the second address.

I did call Tim with the info, but it wasn't out until 12:55 or so.  I
managed to get Tim because I sent him email earlier in the day telling
him that his phone number looked messed up -- and he called me and
gave me the correct number.

Yurgh.  Sorry, Chris.
Bob

There seems to have been some sort of email lossage along the way
somewhere.  I never received an email notification, and looks like
a few others did not as well.  That could account for the phone-tree
missing a few branches.

Subject: Illumination Shines Bright!!!!!

Wow! Wow! Wow!

I'm happy to report that the vibe is alive in the Northwest!  We started the
evening off at my place with an informal get together of ravers planning to go
to Illumination.  It was great to meet Spider and Brian Willoughby!  A hi and
big smile to Dread Eye.  All in all over a dozen people came.  Nice to be able
to make connections!

The party was held at the NAF on Marginal way.  They've been having the last
few parties here as it has proven to be the current bust free enviromenment
available.  People were shuttled in from remote parking lots by rented vans. 
It was a great space as there was lot's of room to dance and roam around.  They
had also roped off a bit of space outside for people to cool down.

We got there about 1:30am.  Pasta was spinning an ok set.  Didn't seem that
anyone was motivated during the early part of the evening to groove though.  
Then Donald came on and started warming up people more.  Although, he did seem
a bit choppy in his mixing.  

And then Garth came on spinning some extremely FUNKY grooves!!! People were
getting down, walking around smiling and interacting.  Luv phasers were going
off!  My girlfriend Amy and I were dancing by a group of guys from LA who gave
her a Garth tape just because she was grooving and smiling!  Someone was
passing around little cards with I-ching symbols that said "Think good
thoughts" on them.  Hyperion Muse was in top form providing great projected
visuals.  

Jeno followed Garth and completely blew away the crowd!  Tribal therapy at it's
finest!!!  He played a lot of new stuff I hadn't heard before as well as some
old favorites mixed only as Jeno can! 

Hats off to Daniel, Efrom, and Tate of No One productions for providing a great
environment to rave and spread the vibe.  BTW, these guys came up from the Bay
Area to do this rave.  Daniel said he was heading back down there after this to
open a warehouse space.  I told him that his crew should stay up here and throw
more parties.

I would like to thank all the people that contributed to a wonderful night!!!

Peace y'all!!!

Yes.  You usually get fined and/or community service.  The charge is
usually Minor in Posession [of alcohol, etc].

It sucked when I got one 6 days before my 21st birthday.  $89 fine.
My friend got two and on the second one he was told that if he got
another one he had to go to rehab each saturday for 6 weeks.  :-(

First of all Hallucination Generation (Jeff, Lisa, and I) want to thank
everyone who came to Vortex.  And wanted to thank everyone for all of the
compliments and observations.  We REALLY had a good time throwing the party
and I know that people had a good time being there.

We also wanted to thank the Vortex DJ's whose playing sent people through
the vortex and slammed them directly into a psychedelic black hole:
Tony - James - Josh - Markie - Ernie - Buck

There was only one word to describe their playing INCREDIBLE !


We also want to thank the twisted souls who did visuals for us:
Craig Larson - Synergy - Donovan

Props to SF promotion: Chris :)

Props to SJ promotion: Lauren 8-)

And to the crew of One Step:  Super Duper Double Props!

Oh yeah, I forgot:  Yummy sound was provided by - JK SOUND  (It tasted great!)

And of course DAT taping services provided by MykL G (great work!)

Video taping of the event was done by Nitty Gritty Productions (the best!)


Right now we are resting because it took alot out of us to throw that gig. 
It wasn't really tough, just exhausted from over 8 weeks of prep and
promotion.

After we rest we will be returning, trippier than before!

Thanks - Peace :)

John - Jeff - Lisa

Adding to Brian's list of Full Moon Raves, here's some extra info.  Does anyone
remember when the Gray Whale Cove rave was?  Supposedly it was one of the best
one's up to that time.  It must have been late 91 or early 92.

(Quick digression -- went to Mr. Happy's Disco, put on by the Love Garage
people, at the King Street Garage.  A smallish crowd, but I left at 1:30. 
Aaron spun a true piano house set, and had me dancing all evening -- vocals in
almost every track.  Supposedly the week before they had 250+ people.  The End
Up on Sunday afternoon was hopping, too, as usual.  Great place to get some sun
and music if nothing is happening at the park or the beach.)

Anyway, here's my addition to the FMR list.


1991

May or June - First FMR, held on Baker Beach.  Quickly busted.

July - Candlestick Park (my first full moon rave!)

August - Marin Headlands, a little campground just outside the Golden Gate,
	 right on the beach, moved to Candlestick Park after a quick bust. 
September - 
October - 
November - 
December - Marin Headlands, Battery Alexander

1992

Jan - 
Feb - Candlestick Park
March - 
April - Vallejo, middle of a housing development
May - Woodside residence

June -----> wasn't this one canceled, due to recent police crackdowns?

July - That farm in the east bay, with the mile-long driveway
August - That farm in the east bay, with the mile-long driveway
September - Bonny Doon *
October - Bonny Doon *
November - Berkeley Marina *

Subject: VORTEX (The So-So)

In my not so humble opinion the party was great.  The people who attended
were, as usual, the heavy trippers, so the vibe was in full effect and the
mood was set for a great nite.  And it did go off in a wonderful way.

Things that I did not like was the no backpacks.  We really didn't know
about this until the night of the event.  The management was not available
to have a walk-through or a meeting before the event so...and I AM sorry
about the water charge.  They know that ravers don't drink that much, so
they tried (that is, ONE STEP) to max out whatever they could make at the
bar.  Oh well...it was nice to see that people took it in stride and still
didn't let that damper their enthusiasm.  We DID talk to them about their
security.  A while back (before the riot BS at ONE STEP) the security would
walk through the crowd with flashlights. Usually shining them on women's
asses.  VERY UNCOOL.  They were especially pushy back then.  We talked to
them and they assured us that it would NOT happen.  And it didn't.  You
hardly knew security was there.  Oh yeah,  at a certain time they did let
people in with backpacks.  So some were lucky, others were not.

Given what SC/SJ is like, and given what has happened there in the past,
and given what has been happening to the scene, I agree with the pat-down
technique they employed.  ALL they were looking for is weapons.  I
especially liked the way in which the women were handled.  No patting their
asses (like at Foundation and Get Down), and feeling them up.  This is
ILLEGAL in this state.  All they did (as I saw it) was tell one girl with a
vest to open it up, and they felt the pockets.  I did see a guard tap, with
the topside of his index & middle finger, the front pockets of one girl
whose pockets were bulging.  But they did NOT ask anyone to open their
stuff.  So it was more of a nuisance than anything, but necessary.

Smoke machines...I have mixed feelings about the machine itself, but like a
DJ, I see it as a necessity when in an enclosure.

The DEAL:  Ok.  This was the 5th Vortex party.  This one was the fourth one
that was ALL AGES.  Uh, hardly saw ANYONE under 20 if at all.  Most there
were 20-23.
Not a big deal, but when throwing a party for ALL, and considering the
nubmer of people who came from a specific age demographic, I was suprised
that with all the hoopla over "...why aren't there more all ages...""...16+
need parties too..." that we didn't have more people from that age group
there.  It could have been the distance, or the place, I dunno.  A rare
chance to see the BEST SF has to offer in terms of DJ's...well some things
I will never figure out.  But the need to throw these parties for all ages
will probably be accomplished by other crews/posses (who primarily throw
massives).  The Vortex will from here on in be centered in our home city of
SF.  If 16++ would support more of these events promoters would make sure
to find venues amicable to this crowd.  No wonder many of the promoters are
doing 18++ or straight 21+.  The market has determined the need and
adjusted itslef accordingly.


As usual, our crowd was a good 500-550.  This is our comfort level at a
party.  We don't do massives, and never will. So we were pleased that the
trippers came and gave us the proper magnetic field for the trip through
the vortex.

Peace...
John

This one got delayed, cancelled, etc. numerous times.
According to one message it was supposed to be at the end of John Daly
Blvd in Daly City.  Went there Sunday lunchtime, met up with a few other
ravers, then found out it was moved to 16th and Harrison.  The music
there got started at around 2pm with Carlos (?).  Around 100 or so showed up,
eventually, vibe and party level at medium.

And it was supposed to be 3 days! Oh well...  The beach in Daly City was
a cool spot but the winds were at gale force level down on the sand.
Evidentally Tilt-a-Whirl was having something in the Berkeley Marina
(at a club?) but we never got around to checking it out..

Subject: VORTEX (The UGLY)

I didn't want to do the whole Sergio Leone thang, so instead of the BAD it
was the So-So, because there was nothing really bad about the party...IMHO.

With that said, I do think there was some severe UGLINESS that happened:

Thugs - What happened to some people's windows was fucked up.  We think it
is just the Santa Cl/SJ element within the area who are more concerned with
fucking things up that were the problem.  We are truly sorry for what
happened to the people who were randomly vandalized (Note:  My car window
got gobs, and gobs, of filthy spit on it.  I considered myself lucky). 
Someone drove a considerable distance to go the the big VEE and got her car
broken into and vandalized.  I apologized to her and worked things out.  I
would like to know if any of you know someone who got that shit done to
them at Vortex @ One Step on 6/5-6 so that I may contact them. Any clues,
leave me mail.  A friend of mine from SJ who has been to every big VEE said
to me "...man that's why people stopped doing shows down here...they're
fucked up down here man!".  I don't agree.  Some ARE fucked up, but the
majority are quite cool.  It is just that a few bad thugs can spoil it for
all.  Especially when it comes to parties/raves.  I won't risk it again. 
Until SC/SJ (SC is SANTA CLARA) get's it's act straight, the Vortex wont be
spinning in that direction for quite a while.  I will keep my eyes, and
ears more in tune to what happens down there is SC/SJ.  And if things get
better then we MAY consider it.

Protectors - I don't know what was up with the cops walking through the
party.  I guess they wanted to make sure all was well.  One Step management
said that after that big fiasco in April they've done it regularly.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The cops are VERY,VERY well aware what is going on with
and at parties.  The night of the full moon I got a call from Santa Cruz
PD, leaving their names and address for the mail list.  I know rumours were
floating about the posibility of a Bonnie Doon rave....I also know that
when FOUNDATION got busted the cops were waiting for them at the their NEXT
location.  Then they moved it to Berkeley Marina. Uh, people, they are
becoming quite organized and are going to make sure that this summer is not
a blowout (25th anniv of Summer of Love, or so I thought).  Any place near
suburbia is bound to get problems.  But why, when you move things to the
city are there less problems, most of the time.  NO CITY MONEY.  And cops
are REAL busy in a city that has 100,000 per square mile!  Your best bet
for non-permitted is STILL SF, hands down.  This scene should be driving
itself underground, and FAST.  If we do it before being forced by the
millicents to do so we maintain control of OUR scene and can make it thrive
once again.  FMR , Late Train, and OM are so far the only ones with the
vision to do the right thing.  Take it UG, NOW!


Double-D promoter UGLIES:

I am going to make this short.  But this is THE first time, since my moving
from LA, that I have encountered a direct BS from another crew.  Dig it:

6/5 was vortex.  There was also something at 16th & Harrison, Pruple Rain -
a 3 day gig, and unbeknownst to me until 6/5, Celebration of Life in SJ. 
Celebration put something to this effect on their vox mail the nite of 6/5
"....sorry we had to cancel our party tonite, but we'd rather cancel than
having a shitty party at One Step Beyond.  Thanks and stay tuned."  Man, 
all I can say is our feelings were very hurt by this lack of ehtics.  In SF
there has always been a rivalry of the promoters.  And it gets fierce.  But
I have YET to see this type of BS go down.  All I can say is, it's all
elemental at this stage.  I plan on partying/promoting in SF, some East Bay
events, and north of the City.  But until SC/SJ acts right....nuff said. 
No wonder Wally and the boyz moved their show up here.  I just hope that
those ehtics are not typical of SC/SJ.  It does make you wonder WHY there
isn't a big scene there though huh (with such a large suburbian populace,
etc.)?


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Despite all of the outside negative energy exerted on the vibe, it went off
in a very positive way!  And we are still smiling about the overall
production, and the people who make the V the V.  Vortex has been a success
in carrying on the tradition that Leary stated so well - "...a psychedelic
experience, with the use of lights, color, and sound"
  
Peace and Smiles :)

Subject: One Step Beyond: DON'T


DON'T   DO NOT   NO   NO EXCEPTIONS

This is the kind of negativity that assaulted me when I showed up at
the door to Vortex at "One Step Beyond".

*NO BACKPACKS* Says the guy at the door. I ask "Why not". "Those are
the rules". The guy gives me a look meant to intimidate drunks at
1:30am.  I say "Do you realize I'm going to go in there and exercise
for 10 hours? I need to bring in a sweater, and a water bottle, and
some food to keep my energy up." "NO EXCEPTIONS," says the guy,
staring me straight in the eye.

"Okay, okay,", I say. I walk back to the car, and begin to sort the
stuff out of my duffle bag.  I almost decide to forget about it. But
after all, it is an hour and forty five minute drive home to Davis. If
it were in Berkeley, I'd have gone and found something else, but I'm
tired of driving, so I decide to give it a try. Besides, I can always
just go back to my car when I need some stuff.

I go to the window and hand them my $10. "Sorry, it's fifteen dollars
now." I look at my watch; it's 11:01. "I was here on time. The
gentleman outside made me go put my stuff in the car. There was no
event information announcement about backpacks, and I *was* here for
the pre-11-o-clock price." "No, exceptions, $15."

By this time, I am getting pretty frustrated. So I go back to my car
to get more money. I just recently emptied my coin jar, and I have a
huge amount of dimes. So I count $15 in dimes and bring it to the
window. I slap it down and begin to feel a bit better. One of the guys
at the door laughs (he does not work for the club) and says that's his
favorite thing to do, save up change and pay for raves that way.

Now that I've been lightened of my $15, I go in, and only then see a
sign saying "No ins-and-outs. Once you leave you're GONE." (Gone is in
bold slanted letters.)

Well that's just fucking great. Why not just beat up everyone with a
nightstick when they come in the door? It's more honest and less
frustrating. Jesus, these things are supposed to be about brotherhood,
togetherness, sharing a great experience. My first impression was
"Who's running this, the Nazis?"

I managed to forget about it eventually. I perservered, found the
groove, and danced with a lot of very friendly people. The music and
the visuals were great. I love Buck. Got everyone frenzied at 6am :).
A very good experience despite the terrible beginning.

The problems weren't completely the promoters' fault, to be fair. The
rules and security people were the club's. But I do hold the promoters
responsible for not finding this stuff beforehand and letting people
know. One thing they did that I really appreciate is to put the price.
in the telephone message. I really appreciate that.

Moral of the story:

If you're a promoter, find out the details of your site. Don't assault
your patrons first thing with a highly negative experience. We already
have too many rules, too many signs, and too many fences. Be thorough,
and put any gotchas in the info message. Introduce the site in a
positive fashion, and don't pick sites that are not conducive to this.

I won't be attending any more events at One Step Beyond, no matter how
good they are. I don't believe I should reward such tactics with any
more of my money.

Peace,

Sean

Gray Whale Cove was my FIRST Full Moon, I think it was right after

But it could have been as late as Jan of 92

I distributed the info based on the phone tree that bbehlen gave me.
If your name was not on that tree then, and you didn't ask me to be put
the tree during the day, you were not notified.  A couple of people asked
to be notifed by phone but neglected to give their phone numbers,
I sent replys to their e-mail addresses saying that I did not have
their phone numbers but some of these were late in the day.  Nexsys is in
my home, I am not jacked in 24 hours a day so I was away for most of the day
until the evening.  Just because you had an agreement to be called under
Brian does not mean that I knew about it.  Basically I sent out a notice
to the people on the list that I had early on in the day, asking for people
who wanted to receive calls at home, a couple of people replied that they 
wanted to be called but DID NOT LEAVE their phone numbers.

I did not add people to the list that I did not know,  the whoole purpose of
the list was because we thought that the public list was TOO public,
if you were not on the list that brian gave me then you would not have been
contacted.  Remember the info was released LATE, I posted the mail at
1:00 A.M. so If you were upset that you hadn't received a call by 12:30 you
shouldn't be because calls were not being made till after 1:00 am.

Most people did indeed get the info because I also posted it on nexsys
and the nexsys modem rang continuously from 12:30 to 2:00 when I left.
I was at home until 2:30 am and as my message said, you could always call me.
when I left, I put the directions on my voice mail and my phone number
is plastered all across my e-mail messages.

So in essence, please don't blame me for missing the FMR, remember it is an
UNDERGROUND event, we do not pass out fliers, I felt like I left enough 
"alternative" methods of people finding the info with out making it too obvious,
we considered the site somewhat "sensitive" (and I guess so did the police)
so I was not about to post it to the "list" in any way.

Subject: Re: Digital Music Channel Questions and Ponderings.

I had a chat with a salesperson about this service. I briefly scanned
the display and said "Hmmm maybe when they get about 200 channels of
music. They don't play the stuff I like to listen to."

She seemed perplexed that there would actually be some music that this
service doesn't play. So she asked me one of my all time favorite
questions to be asked: "What kind of music do you like to listen to?"

I smiled. "I like to listen to _all_ kinds of music. Lately, I've been
listening to a lot of techno and ambient techno: Orbital, The Orb, The
Shamen, etc. . I also like a lot of, for lack of a better category
'Women's music': Sarah McLachlin, Tori Amos, Happy Rhodes, Loreena
McKennit (which could be either womens or Celtic)." Her eyes showed no
trace of recognition so far.

"I also listen to a lot of Celtic music (correctly pronouncing it
KELL-TIC), especially Celtic harp. I like a lot of alternative, and
some progressive bands like Talk Talk, The Cure, Lush, Tribe, and so
on. And once in a while I listen to pop or classical or jazz as my
mood fits."

"So I'd want at least one channel each for these different genre's.
Techno could be divided up into several actually. So I really wouldn't
be getting my money's worth."

She looked pretty doubtful.

"Do they carry any radio stations on there?"
"No."
"Is there a printed schedule?"
"No, it's all random."
"Hmmm, that makes it pretty hard to tape things. Is there an optical
output?"
"Ummm I don't know. What's that?"
"It's a fiber optic jack so you can go direct digital to digital. I'd
probably want to feed this directly to a DAT."
"No."

I smiled and said "Sorry to be so negative. It just doesn't seem to
provide anything that I'd want. Thanks for your time though."

I looked at the back of a unit last week and it turns out it does have
an optical output jack. Want to take bets on whether it sets SCMS
bits? :)

I've heard that some places give directions to the place where the

That might be one way to stay ahead of the cops. They'll find you
anyway but I wouldn't make it easy for them.

Maybe we *do* need an army of attorneys. Who ever thought we'd have to

Yeah, I'm with you Sean, I don't care if it is Jeno, Markie, Garth and God
spinnin, if it's at the One Step, I AIN'T GOIN. PERIOD.

I knew they were like that from the git, no wonder peole get shot there.
The security is too busy making it hard for the party goers and SC Police
are too busy looking for Drugs, to keep the street gangs from breaking into
people's cars outside. (It's easier to harass ravers, a Mountain View cop
tells me that the SJ street gangs who ripoff car stereos carry automatic
weapons).

I have DMC now on my cable system. The only channel that is any where near
a rave channel is the Dance channel (17). I seriously think they need help
on their programming.:)  Would the DJ's and the promotors of the
raves go for this idea. If you are broadcasting live events, wouldn't it
draw the crowd away from the events? Or do you mean have them broadcast from
a studio or a college radio station like KSCU or KZSU?

Subject: So Why Does the South Bay Suck So Much?


Here's my perspective, from living in SJ.  A few reasons:

1) There simply aren't very many events, so those that do happen tend
to be attended by everyone, including the boneheads.  In SF there are
enough things going on that the boneheads can go someplace else.  The
SJ punk scene has the same problem.

2) In Silicon Valley, the rift between the haves and the have-nots is
very clear.  You're either an engineer (or a manager of engineers),
or you're a grunt with no possibility of advancement.  The strata are
very clear.  So, there is a large population that is just pissed off
and doesn't care.

3) There are roughly 19,000 cops per square inch in San Jose.  They are
are very pushy and officious (to say the least) and create a lot of
tension.  So, when people get a chance (they think) to cut loose, they
get crazy and stupid.  

4) You can't do anything in SJ anyway because it's illegal to do anything
after 2 AM.  

So what do you do?  I don't know.  You can have private parties but that's
about it.

...that is, if someone down the street doesn't call the cops and get you
fined for talking loudly at your barbecue.

Mindware in Santa Cruz used to carry mind machines. If they don't anymore
they probably would know who does. Their phone # is 1-800-447-0477. Also
Beat City Records (also in Santa Cruz, CA) used to carry Brian Gysin's
mind machine. I can't seem to find the card with the number so you will

Welcome to america.. we will be checking your papers now...

I know the feeling. My 5th night in california I was pounceed on my 2 redwood city cops for parking illegally ( Funny, though, the car was still in drive, and I was just being told by my friends that I was illegally parked and was turning around to back up when.. )

I handed over my out of state license, that read clearly , and in english
the state it was issued, the cop says " Ohh youre form misouri " ( the license was mississippi ) I said " No sir, Its a mississippi license.. he looks at me " oh whatever, its somewhere out in the midwest " I looked puzzled.. " No sir, its on the east coast, deep south " My thought was that it was a drunk test. 
The officer replied " I dont give a damn where you are from, you wnat me to give you the ticket? I will if you keep smarting off to me like that " Etc....
I was very pleased. This is what my tax dollars pay for. Not only did he refuse to listem to me about why I was parked illegally, but told me the the  righTaND turn I made constituted driving on the wrong sode of the road... and that it was illegal to drive on the wrong side of the road..etc.. and he wondered if they drove on the wrong side in misouri... 

( Pardon my spelling once again.... * Sigh *

but all I can say is, If I had the funds in my pocket that night, I would have 
moved out of the area right then. Thats why I always smile when I see one of redwoods finest.... and you know.. they honestly wonder WHY people in my age group ( 20ish ) are so overdefensive and apprehensive towards teh police , who are ' only there to help', and I feel sorry for the few honest police that are out there, being decent human beings ..... 

Somehow, I know there is an answer, the thing is I also know that it does not involve guns, batons, mace , riot gear , and jail threats. 
It involves peace. Or at least a stepping towards it.

Actually, its deepr than that... as I was told by a friend of mine form the area,
the water temple used to be a big hangout, and that after a while it was abused with drug use, and etc./. and that some people were injured there in that large well looming item ( If you look thru the grating, its really neat, aset of steps and waterways ) when they were drunk,. and that osme ordinanace or another prevented breathing in the park unless it was daylight, you had a note form uyour mother. * Sigh *

Though I love the water temple ...... I can picture it as a perfect site for 
the FMR .. the first time I saw it was under a full moon... all the beauty in the world, and a few silly peopl ein black hauling guns have the ability to tell us No we cant experience it. .. and people ask me whats wrong with reality ....

Subject: ALERT: PGP now back on soda




cancel red alert.


----- Begin Included Message -----

You can stop spreading the word now.  PGP is back on soda.  Remember,
it is my analysis that soda is still able to distribute PGP because we
keep a low profile.  Please keep it that way.  You can find pgp with
archie, so I don't feel the need to advertise.

Lots of stuff happened today after I posted my initial announcement
that PGP had gone offline.  Because of the intervention of Eric
Hollander with the folks who are in charge of the machine,
reasonableness has prevailed.  What happened in a nutshell was the
following.  Person A, a fascist asshole by all accounts, simply turned
off the PGP directory without telling me.  I started getting questions
by email from folks trying to get PGP.  Person A's argument was that
PGP was illegal, therefore soda should not distribute it.  Eric
Hollander, after some initial rounds, played trump and observed that
the machine had been recompiled without the user limit that had been
part of the OS license agreement, and recommended that soda be shut
down immediately because the kernel that soda was running was contrary
to the license agreement.  Very quickly the president of the
organization which runs soda intervened and everything was OK.

What is still troubling to me is the nastygram that came down from
CERT.  We don't know how they were informed, nor what their policy is
on this.  I'll have another message on that angle later.

Again, sending this to the whole list sounds really bad Geoff.  I'm to the

1am is ridiculous. 11pm is the latest I've ever sent it out, and we've never
had trouble.  Believe it or not, if you tell them not to show up until after
a certain time, Geoff, they just might.

I'm still pissed at you for using that site.  I would have not recommended
having the FUll Moon there.  Maybe a smaller renegade with 100-200 people,
but not something with 400-500.  

I fucking hate elitism.

I dunno, I feel if we're putting so much effort into holding something

I cross checked the list and some people asked to be called and their names
were NOT on your phone list.

As I said before any name that didn't have a number I first cross checked
with the phone list that you gave me, if there number was NOT on that list
they got a message from me.

Well Brian, if you are doing something that you feel bad about if it is
discovered, then maybe you shouldn't do it.  I don't feel bad because we had
agreed before that the FMR list would go "underground" which is what happened.
As far as I'm concerned the list can still operate that way.  I have no
qualms about appearing elitist, I know what I am and am not.

The FMR organizer asked me to not post it till after 1 am because of the small
location and to minimize the number of people that were expected, you can
take it up with him if you like.

Brian must I remind you that you are the one complaining about me posting
this to the entire list.  I have nothing to hide.  I offered several
ways for people to find out about the FMR.  In the end all someone had
to do was to call my number which was blasted all over the net ands I 
most likely would have told them, after 2 am it was on my voice mail,
I don't see where these actions were in the least bit elitest.
It sounds more elitist that you wanted to save PWT for your own party.
And I can understand you being upset at me for telling the FMR people
about this site, pray tell me how giving away this site to 400 - 500
people for a FMR is more elitist then...

We don't withhold information we sorta make people go on a little
easter egg hunt, there's nothing wrong with that, in the UK right now
people have to sometimes go through 3 or 4 mappoints before they get
to the party.

Yea,  I kinda figured that something might have delayed the mail,
because I noticed that the mail was time stamped about 1 am,
but the internet gateway got it way after 3 am.    I quit checking
at about 3 am,  thinking that if I had to drive a long ways to
make the FMR,  I wouldn't want to go.    Apparently the directions
came at about 3:30 or later in the mail.

I personally think that DMX (Or DMC) or whatever they call it,  should
have rave music in the home...   It makes GREAT exewrcise music and
I would have it on all the time.

Er, what?  PGP is freeware, so it coulnd't possibly by pirated.
Besides, since when has CERT been involved in combating software

I'm sure many of us can share stories of having stuff ripped off in
or around raves.  Not too long ago, at the last Basics in Richmond,
leather jackets and other stuff were taken from the trunk of my car.
Much to my surprise, I discovered that my renter's insurance policy
views my car as an extension of my home.  Not only was my stuff covered,
but my friend's $700 custom designed motorcycle jacket was also covered
(I live in SF, he lived in Oakland,  we spent the night raving together:
technically, he was my overnight out-of-town guest).  We were covered
for the cost of replacement minus the $200 deductable.   All the insurance
Co. required was that I file a police report and provide some kind of
evidence, like photographs, that the stolen items once existed in our
possesion. 

So if you get ripped off while out partying, think back and try to 
remember if the stuff was taken from your vehicle, or the vehicle of 
an insured friend you happened to be staying overnight with...

11:00 or so (to allow for internet delays) would jeapordize the event if
it being announced at other raves ...

Every month there seem to be a growing number of public requests
for info from (I assume) people not on the tree

It seems to me that one of the coolest things this list and the calendar
can provide is advice 
Recommendations from those who go out alot are welcome by the fringier,
poorer, overworked or just plain casual rave attendees

I realize security was the original concern but I just don't buy it
Who is reading?
Local city police all over the bay?
The DEA?

I doubt anyone is monitoring 24hrs a day - even on evenings of a full moon
It just doesn't seem like an efficient use of police time

I ask from those in-the-know what ever lead to the belief that this list
was a leak to the police?

   Anyone remember the FMR at the Cliff House (actually on the circular

Subject: what's all the fuss about the 'Las Pulgas Water Temple'


when i heard that the FMR was happening there, i basically blew off
going to the FMR -- i used to live in palo alto and spent some time
exploring/mtn-biking the parks in that region. I also know that the
cops in the area don't have any real crime to deal with, so they just
go around enforcing normalcy and hassling those that don't fit in. the
water temple is a very well-known place for partying, and i'm sure
checking it out is part of our police orificers regular rounds.

so, i don't really understand why brian got PO'd at Geoff w/r/t using
the site. Yes, it's a beautiful site, but it just isn't rave-worthy
unless we happen to spray all the cops in the area with our patented
lysurgic acid atomizer love phazers. I don't care how small a rave it's
going to be, it's gonna get busted.

the only thing that really pissed me off was that i never found out
about the candlestick afterparty location -- i was vaguely thinking
about waking up at 6AM and raving, but wasn't ready to treck down to
the south-bay for something that I *KNEW* was going to be a bust come
sunrise. sure would be nice if there was a voicemail # to call to get
this kind of info.

----------

fyi, there are some sites up in the hills that would be very
appropriate for a rave -- however, folks would need to hike in over
approx 2 miles of rough dirt fire trails to get there.

I can't quite remember where the site is, but I can certainly ask some
friends of mine that showed me the site while I was in Kawlich. That
is, if they're willing -- it happens to be the site of a certain secret
Stanford U fraternity psychedelic initiation site...

There's also these cool nearby wind-caves with honeycomb walls...

The site i'm thinking of has one additional benefit -- it used to be an
outdoor "speakeasy" back in the 20's -- there's still the remnants of a
huge marble U-shaped table and these stone chairs around the circumference
of the table.

To me, FMRs have always reminded me to some extent of 1920's speakeasy
flapper events out in nature where liquor, ganga, opium, jazz, sex and
dancing intertwingled the party people of the time with their own sort
of vibe. So perhaps the ghosts of then and now could mingle. From a 
less romantic perspective, the speakeasy table would make a good place
to put the turntables.

God, I wish I could remember where it is. I know it's somewhere off of
Hwy 84.

Oh, and given that it is off of 84, parking would be a major problem
there...

my $0.04: It's been widely theorized that there are police subscribing
to sfraves.  Personally, I think it's pretty likely.  It does seem
that the new cloak-n-dagger approach has resulted in less busts.

Call me paranoid.  I also think there's a big difference between
announcing the FMR location at a rave at 2 am, where the cop has to
actually be there to hear it; and announcing it on a open public email
list.  Cops have computers too, nothing easier than sitting in front
of a terminal with coffee and a doughnut -- "hey guys, it's at the
Charter Oak again... this should be fun!"

It was amazing that there were at least a dozen CHP cruisers at the
last FMR.  It's been widely theorized that they really want to crack
down on this sort of thing, and they know that the FMR happens at the
full moon, so they ARE looking for it.

I don't think anyone here is truly "in the know", but the FMR
organizers (which are NOT SFRAVERS, though some SFR people help out
sometimes) have asked that the location not be posted to the list.
It's their party, and we should respect that.  The email/phone tree is
the SFR attempt to let people know without a public posting to the
list. 

I guess I'm trying to say:

a) given the nature of these events, it's important to be careful
b) given how easy it is to subscribe and dial-in, we've got to assume
     there are cops on the list
c) so we shouldn't post FMR info on the list
d) a and b don't really matter, as the organizers don't want it posted
     on the list, and we should respect that anyway
e) the email/phone tree does a better job than the alternative,
     having nothing

I'm sure if someone comes up with a better SECURE system, and is
willing to spend the time to implement and update it, everyone will be
thrilled.  The status quo exists thanks to Brian and his investment in
time in emailing people and figuring things out the night before
(Geoff did it for the last one).  Given his time spent with this list,
I can't imagine anyone seriously suggesting that Brian personally fix
this problem.

Personally, I'm tapped out at the moment, so I'm going to be
completely lame and pass.  Takers?

That's certainly true here in California anyhow.  My cousin had his

He has replaced them with new ones, at the loss of the deductible.

My point exactly,  so lets start using PGP,   and with the help of
the Cypherpunks,  we should be able to make a mail listserver that
is smart enough to take and encrypt messages to each recipient using
their public key so they can read it.    Then,  at raves,  where people
meet and dance and interact,  people can verify each other's keys,
and keep the pigs completly out of the loop.   So,  what say?  Any
comments?   I'l propose the idea to Cypherpunks,  as they are also
contimplating encrypting their mailing list anyway.

>Personally, I'm tapped out at the moment, so I'm going to be

I'll look into this....!!   Cypherpunks meeting is this Saturday,
and I think this would be a good discussion topic to add to our
agenda...  I'll report on the results...

In the meantime,   get your copy of PGP soon before the pigs eradicate
all copies.

Check it out, vinyl 12" lovers--Star Alley.  They have a huge selection of
12" vinyl.  I almost fainted when I walked in, there was that smell of
plastic all around me.  They have lots of rap, soul, house and funk.  They
have the current releases of techno, acid, and trance, as well as the top
forty classical (great for those samples ;) ) and rock.  They also have a 
credible selection of CDs.  Their prices are higher than what i've seen 
around (current vinyl runs ~$9.29).  But, they have depth!  I've been looking
for a 12" of Afrika Bambaata & SoulSonic Force's _Planet_Rock_ for almost
a year.  I sort of spun around at one point, and there it was!

Star Alley is at 322 Linden Street in SF, which is between Fell and Hayes, 
just off Gough.  The phone is (415) 552-3017.

And really, I got nothing for this--i'm always happy to see more vinyl.  I
am also impressed to find a fine selection of rap and hip/hop in the city.
So, go out and buy some techno, and let 'em know we want more, more, more!

  Why would a cop want to sit on a mailing list that talked about a
few illegal events once in awhile mostly out if his jusisdiction?
Would a cop actually call another PD to tell them about a rave?

  I think if sombody is "infiltrating" sfraves, which sounds
incredibly too paranoid to me, it would be an individual who thinks
raves are the end of civilization and calls the police every time they
hear of one.  Then if this is the case, you couldn't really keep them
off the phone tree anyway.

  So why bother.  It's good to be careful.  But no use in being
paranoid.

Subject: Do we need an Sfraves FAQ? 


Once upon a time, there were some unpleaseant experiences
with police arriving at the announced FMR sites before
anyone could even set up a sound system.  It seemed likely
that they were indeed reading the sfraves list.  

So Full Moon Rave locations will no longer be announced on
the list.  Instead, there is a phone tree system.  In order
to get on the phone tree, you have to ask someone in person,
not just by email.  Yeah, they *could* send out an
undercover cop disguised as a raver that could get on the
phone tree, but this is more work (and probably harder to do
than it sounds.  What does a real raver look and sound like?
How do you not act like a cop when you are a cop?  These
aren't simple questions to answer).

The idea of all this rigamarole isn't to play snobbish
in-group games, it's a reaction to an oppressive situation:
the cops are going out of their way to prevent peaceful
citizens from assembling in public places.  This is
"elitism" all right, but it's not elitism for it's own sake,
it's born of neccessity.

Encryption of (a) the sfraves list or (b) the phone tree
email has been discussed and rejected (for now at least).
Largely because it doesn't seem to gain much that the phone
tree system doesn't give.  Decryption keys have to be given
out to people on a person by person basis, just like people
get added to the phone tree on a person by person basis.
Spying on email is much harder to do just subscribing to a
public list, and it doesn't seem to be the problem.  Yet. 

Oh, and the phone tree list usually incorporates double
redundancy:  Each person is called by two other people, just
in case one of them can't do it for some reason.  We could
probably increase this to triple redundancy without much
hardship.  I've never had to make more than two or three
calls, myself.

It is not hard to find the FMR, if you are determined.
I'm sure everyone on the list knows someone who knows someone, who
will know where it is.  What about the 750 people who showed up
at the Palo Alto Wetlands, they didn't know anybody on the list!

As a datapoint, a friend of mine who is not opn the list knew the location
at 11:30 (a leak from a member of dub tribe) she is notorious for not being
able to keep a secret and proceded to call every one of her friends in San Jose
and beyond, telling them the location (without the benefit of telling them
to not show up until 2:00 am, SHe calle me for confirmation, and I implied
that she had the wrong site, so she felt like she had to call all of those
people and tell them otherwise... she was still at the site dancing away
when I got there, when I got there she understood why, I had to mislead her 
and was not angry.  It is not hard to find the FMR, all the "Family" in SF
who do not have e-mail (most don't even have cars) seem to always show up
for each and every one.

We also owe it to some of the participants who cannot afford to get
arrested by the police, to take reasonable precautions to protect them.
They understand the risks but we should think what it would be like if
they get apprehended and maybe deported just because we want to make sure
everyone has access to FMR info.  Besides the search for the FMR is FUN,
It's one of the last truly underground parties left in the Bay Area,
and I for one believe in free underground parties!  We have seen what happens
when a free party is done in a "legal" space with pre advertising, you
get over 1000 people and gangster's carrying weapons.  (Try staying up to
3 am to drive 30 miles after you been downing 40oz all night).

As far as getting on the SFR phone tree, well I think it should still be
by face to face introduction, if you don't want to come to a smokey night club
to meet one of us, there is the South Bay SFR lunch organized by elezabet@cadence.com (who does NOT go to the clubs, but still typlifies the essence of
what it truly is to be a Raver in the Bay Area) every week which is held
outdoors in a park in Palo Alto)  maybe you guys in San Francisco should
have A SF SFRAVES lunch.  It's not hard to meet us.  If someone can't 
expend the effort to do one of these things then maybe they really don't
want to go to the FMR after all.  You know even if a cop shows up to a lunch,
I think s/he will be blown away by the love and "Family Values" that are
expressed at an SFR Lunch, (elizabet is VERY pregnent right now!) and I can't
help but thinking how silly they would feel infiltrating the SFR FMR phone tree.

Personal meeting also gives us a chance to figure out who the leak might be,
if FMRS start getting busted.  Since we are having this discussion publicly
we must assume that "They" are listening, if we choose the right safeguards
it doesn't really matter, we can still display an open invitation (which
is what openness and egalitarianism is all about) and protect something
that is precious to us.  I think all would agree that there are acres of
abandonded warehouse space and industrial areas in East and West Oakland
and Emeryville that we could stage FMRs in but we don't, are we being elitist?
or safety conscious (or BOTH!)  Ultimately if we truely are not elitist then
we should welcome the Oaktown Homies and (the Concord Cowboys :) to our events
right along with all "Primos" from the Mission district, this will happen in
good time, It is my personal belief that you don't need to have "outreach"
or Afirmative Action if you just learn to make friends with people that are
out of your social/racial/economic group to this extent, I always try to welcome
Homeboys when I see them at raves, I've seen other people do this as well
although lately people have been less friendly.  These guys no matter how
hard they look just want to be loved and hugged like anybody else.  Yeah
we take risks,  but then we are use to taking risks, some of us risk alot
at each FMR or other underground event.  So people have given up their lives.

I'm not sure the issue here is necessarily one of elitism.  It seems that
in order for (true) raves to continue happening and spreading, people are 
being simply being asked to reach out, learn about, care for, and build a
sense of trust in one another.  Looking cool isn't quite enough, and it 
shouldn't be, because through raving we are sharing more than a style, we 
are sharing special feelings and sometimes spiritual experiences.  We are 
continueing to develop into a community that welcomes *anyone* who wants to 
share in this, but all this community asks is that to some extent people 
honestly communicate to one another and hopefully transcend the selfish, 
ego-centered, cliqueish, what's-in-it-for-me mentality we've all been 
programmed with. 

The point here is that the attitude of "Hey, I hear that there's a fun
party going on, and *I* want to know about it." misses the point.  The
attitude that is being (idealistically) encouraged is "Hey, there are some
groovey people out there who I'd like to get to know and share some feelings 
with.  Maybe I should let down some of my defenses and reach out to them."  
The point of SFRaves is not elitist access to information, but the 
opportunity for like-minded people to connect with each other and share a 
vision.

[original post to which Lee's is a reply...]

I think this is what people who are paranoid about the growth of the Net
leading to information elites are talking about...  We are certainly among
the elite, for better or for worse, and it's hard to blame those who don't
yet have access for their (frequently justifiable) paranoia. 

I don't think encryption solves this problem either; distributing keys
becomes a trust-battle in exactly the same way adding someone to the
planners list or to the phone tree is an issue now.

Elitism has become a necessity in the wired world. The more information
that passes through your grasp, the more important it is to know who your
real friends are (and who your enemies are). Another fine example of
communication technologies magnifying the scope of human problems.

If the cops are monitoring this list, why wouldn't they also
subscribe to get their own PGP (whatever it is).  Who knows,
they could have someone planted who's the typical raver that 
goes to all the events.  He can also have this interaction 
between all the partiers and update his PGP;  meanwhile, he
calls the other cops from home or sends email to the other officers 
notifying them of the next event.  If they want to bust parties,
they will, and you will have fewer *real* people at these 
parties because they wouldn't be updated regularly or whatever.

If the phone-tree system worked in the past, let's scrap the 
current list and begin with a new one.  If one person trusts me and
I trust someone else, we can rebuild the list very quickly and
easily.

Perhaps I don't know the real benefits of PGP, so if someone can 
point me to the right direction, I'm willing to do my own research.

Whatever we *want* SFRaves to be, on some level, until everyone has equal
access to the net (don't hold your breath), it *will* be an elitist source
of information.

I didn't mean to suggest that we deliberately instigate elitism, only that
access to the Net is already an elitist thang (though less so every day),
and that it does not necessarily cut across the same boundaries we might
otherwise wish to impose between those we would like to associate with
(i.e. groovy people we want to get to know and share experiences and
feelings with) and those we would just as soon avoid (i.e. fundamentalists,
cops, & other authority figures who would prefer not to let us assemble
peaceably to form our own communities).

We therefore sometimes have to rely on older standards (trust) and other,
more private and direct forms of communication (face-to-face, telephone)in
order to keep our community alive. This doesn't mean we're being snotty,
only that we're trying to protect our community.

My point was a philosophical one, the idea that communication technologies
(like email lists) accelerate the natural processes of both community
formation and community disintegration.

Back to that Ivory Tower...

I'm sure PGP has been discussed hundreds of times in the mailing list,
but in response to your posting Steve,   If a cop has PGP it won't
do them any good,  because in my idea,   key exchanges are always
done in person,   and keys can be "Signed" and thus verified to
be connected with the proper person,  thus preventing spoofing,
and with PGP's multiple recipient capability,   very tight and
closed groups can be formed if simple and proper "Key management"
can be implemented.

As an experienced PGP user,   I am able to have close relationship
with friends I've met in person by signing their keys and having
them sign my key.   Then,  we can communicate in complete security
across half the world and KNOW that we are talking to who we think.

It has done wonders for my consulting,   opening up doors that
were never available before.   Hackers from all over the world
now send me incredable tid bits of info,  they would never consider
sending me otherwise.   My public key is well known throughout the
Net,  and is the way I can recieve encrypted Email.

For more info,   approach me at the next rave,  and I can teach you
all about PGP.   By the way,  the Cypherpunks think it's a good idea
to have a closed group of FMR types in a seperate list.   I have
their support,  and perhaps I can get it on the agenda at the next
upcoming meeting this Saturday.

Someone mentioned how to get PGP.    You can get it in several ways,
I can Email a copy to you,  provided that you let me know what computer
you have (IE:  PC, Mac or UNIX).  Or you can anonymously FTP a copy
from "soda.berkeley.edu" which just recently bacame available again
after CERT put pressure on that site.    "archie" can be used to
identify other sites.   If you don't have Internet access,  you can
Email me,   and if you live in the USA I can send you a copy.

i live in souther cal, souther than LA
chances of me finding out the location of an FMR
i would guess to be pretty high,
BUT i have met people face to face
lived in cabins with them and spent weekends
driving up and down the coast with them

telling me the location PROBABLY isnt a risk
but i COULD be a narc

two opinions i have

ONE - Cops want to bust this
for every berkeley marina dude who says "ravers are peaceful"
there are ten that thing they are drugged out lunatics
who are destroying the society
would a cop read email? maybe maybe not
someone is, and someone is probably telling them

cops have lists of raves going on every night, they pick up the same fliers
and get a lot of the same info everyone else does

another reason cops bust things is cuz club promoters dont like
the idea of free things... competition is one thing
but this communistic free bullshit is just too much

TWO - elitist is when you look at someone and not because you
think they are a cop, but because they look like a
'bridge and tunneler' (????? i think that was the term)
that you wont put them on the fone list

Last year in san diego there was a dude who said he worked
a lot with Toon Town and used to come out to the park
and he was pretty obnoxious and had a whistle that
grated heavily with the outdoor groove

one day he walked up and all the organizers groaned
very loudly
THAT is elitist

about an hour later a park ranger showed up and all the organizers groaned
even louder
THAT is just being aware

(about 20 secs after the first groan, they regained composure
and just asked him not to blow the whistle int he park
and more or less accepted him)

THREE - (like i plan this stuff out) i think its really funny
that someone three thousand miles away causes all this mess
:)
the boy just runs around taking vacations and extending them as he likes

One interesting thing about PGP 2.2 is that it allows for a multiple
recipient list. I doubt it's yet been done, but it wouldn't take too
much hacking (I could do it in Perl in a day or two) to have a list
server accept PGP encrypted submissions, and feed them back out
encrypted to everyone on the list. For the police to intercept this,
they'd have to go way out of their way to bug things. If there wasn't
an informer on the list, it'd be extremely unlikely in my opinion that
the police would actually find out about things.

Note that with the current state of mailers, it makes things
inconvenient to read, but it would be ideal for the occasional post
containing detailed site location information. You'd only send it out
to those people whose keys and identity you've verified in person
(which, I may add, is a good excuse for meeting other people on here).

Well okay it's a lot of trouble and we won't do it. But keep the idea
in the back of your mind. It's a definite possibility. If the busts
start getting ridiculous, it's one way to keep things private.

This is a rad idea.  My wife and I were discussing the same thing for
raves here, in the renegade style.  Have one van with decks and a transmitter,
and have other people tune in on boom boxes and car stereos.  Members of the
renegade posse could buy good sized speakers to transport in their cars.  If
the cops came, the party would just move elsewhere, the next location would be 
could be given out on the radio while people were traveling.  If the cops were
tuning in, the locations could be given in code or "go to location #45" or
something.

Why would a cop want to sit on a mailing list that talked about a

Would a cop actually call another PD to tell them about a rave?

yes, definitely.  many of them think, and 48hrs. et al encourage the public

Well, that was basically what I was asking
If not posting translated into fewer busts then good

Was FMR posted in the calendar or a late post the night of?
The latter still seems pretty safe to me
It would happen late enough that word couldn't spread (too fast), would 
be less susceptible to "broken links", and possibly just as secure

I think it is plenty likely for an undercover cop or two at a rave to
get the same info and protect the world from drugs at the
same time

I agree that they may sub the list but I don't really think they
are watching the mail come in at 1:00 in the morning.

Maybe I am being the paranoid one now

But the cops are not going to screw around waiting for mail or infiltrating
phone trees if they want this information
especially if these are DEA or drug task force people who are just passing
along the FMR info to the appropriate local authorities as a bonus

They could bypass all of these seriously inefficient methods with a 
warrant and a few phone calls to sys admnins

Subject: Pulling the Plug


Hmmm...

I would think it a very bad idea to post any information on the FMRs, or any
other renegade (i.e., illegal) parties, to the sfraves list.  The authorities
would have very little problem pressuring the Universities currently acting
as list and archive servers to shut them down.  

This pressure could come in many forms, especially since Universities (public
and private) rely on state and federal funding for many programs.  Some of
these parties are held in public spaces supported by tax payer monies.  
Connect?  The Universities could also act even without outside pressure to 
avoid the potential embarassment.

The current method of disassociating these events from the list may be the
best way to insure its survival.  I might even be worried that the recent
posts about the FMR sites being found by sfravers could possibly put the list 
at jeopardy -- it could be construed as proof that the list is being used for
illegal activities.

Paranoia?  Maybe, but stranger things have happended.

	Rather then encrypting mailing list and stuff like that, the
	real solution for "sensitive info" is for EVERYBODY especially
	people who share a lot of sensitive info with each other, to
	get themselves PGP keys.  Learn how to use PGP or some other
	form of encryption you will be better off for it, trust me,
	once this happens, then you can choose who YOU would like to
	send secure info to.  So in other words, if I want to send the
	FMR instructions to Brian I can encrypt the info and send it.
	I actually wished he had a key while he was away because then
	I could send him a private message to any account, just in case
	he couldn't log into soda. PGP is abount sending secure information
	to friends and others, information that is private and that you
	don't want others to read.  I would consider it rude to post an
	encrypted message to a public list unless it was an absolute
	emergency (i.e. the Thought Police are at my door, and they are 
	going to take me away).

	The desimination of FMR info should be based on a personal
	system of trust,  PGP is some software that helps you keep the
	integrity of the communications between TRUSTED members, it is
	NOT a substitute for that trust and if used as such, will
	quickly disapoint you, with potentially disasterous
	consequences for some people. (It's better to assume that
	"They" are listening and choose your words, then to believe that
	because you have encrypted your infomation it is safe for you
	to incriminate yourself and others.)  With PGP, if the keys are
	not handled in a proper manner, it is no better than any normal
	private e-mail list.  The only reason that I would advocate
	encryption of the FMR instructions is FOR PRACTICE i.e. (danger
	paranoid statements approaching :) in case the day comes when we
	will really need to send information that we don't want Them to
	know.  The FMR info is not precious, we don't have much to
	loose except the party getting busted.  But if we did encrypt
	the data and use that as a method of distribution to TRUSTED
	roots of the FMR phone tree (which could change from time to
	time, then If the FMRs are mysteriously busted it would mean
	one or more of the following:

	1) One of the TRUSTED is an informant or cop.
	2) One or more of the people on the phone tree (only people
	   who meet visually) are informants or cops.
	3) one of the above persons told the info to an informant or cop.
	4) The cops "get lucky"
	5) The promoters leak the info to someone who knows or who is an
	   informant or cop.
	6) The cops can "break" the PGP code (a SERIOUS problem for cypherpunks)

	It is my assumption that 1 -5 are the most likely, and of 1 - 5
	   3 - 5 are things that we have absolutely NO control over.

Are the police in San Fransisco really so intelligent that they can understand
the concept of the internet? Do they have computers linked to it? Shouldn't
they be out catching real criminals rather than looking through countless
e-mail messages on the off chance they may find where an illegal rave is
happening?? (This week, my volume of mail has been enormous, your average
plod isn't going to have the patience to bother with all that. Is he??)

I don't know, it seems your over estimating the powers of the police. 
certainly in the UK they're all thick, probably thinking computers are
things that take up whole rooms and are operated by spotty geeks in white
overalls. :-)

Over here, if they bust a do, it'll be coz local residents will have
complained, noise pollution/volume of traffic/anything to stop these
youngsters having fun. It's certainly not because they've heard it on
a pirate radio station, or discovered it from e-mail.

Peoples, loose your paranoia, at least your country is not thratened by
"new age travellers," "hippies," Ravers," "corrupting our youth, destroying
our precious countryside in drug crazed orgies." :-)

That's my pounds worth.......I'll crawl back into the dark, damp, depths
of this country, looking forward to going crazy at an FMR (it is a rave??)
sometine this summer.

n-joi,

If there's a 100:1 or so ratio of non-SFR's to SFR's at the full moon parties,
it doesn't seem too likely that SFR is where the cops are getting their 
info.  Especially if it gets posted at 1am.

Wait a minute... I thought the idea to keep FMR info off the list was to
make sure it didn't fall into the wrong hands.

Isn't this a cut and dried 1st amendment problem here?  There are plenty of other
lists and Usenet newsgroups that carry information that is a lot more "illegal"
than SFR.  Talking about illegal activities is a lot different than actually
doing them, thank goodness.  If it came down to it, we could always make a
alt.sfraves newsgroup and there would be no "central" source the authorities 
could crack down on.

YIKES! yes they exist :) in one form or another since 1988 but the scene is

events are rare.

I seem to have problems emailing you directly, so i hope it gets to you.

BTW, in Kingston a scene is starting. Something going on the 26th... I would
suggest checking it out cause DJ sacha is good. Also check the Toronto scene
and the Ottawa scene (just starting to happen).

a song at Connection II that totaly fits what I'm describing but I don't
have the tapes yet so I can't I.D. it.  There are parts in Altern 8's

Hello, everyone!

I've been lurking for a while; gone underground (or is that
mainstream? :) for a bit; planning trips, researching schools, etc...

Anyway- here's my concern about PGP. First, I'm not necessarilly
opposed to using PGP to post information. The only reservation that
I have consists in my overall lack of technological understanding.

My mailbox is still a piece of magic to me. I have some vague 
notion of IDs and tags and sites (only slightly exaggerated ignorance)
; but really, I just push a button, and suddenly I get mail from all 
over! I am willing to learn, but I feel fairly certain that 
the first few times I encrypt or unlock(?)a message, I'll need 
someone standing over my shoulder (a techno teaching angel) 
to help me. I'm uncertain about asking around my 
workplace to do this.

Basically, being the humanities-oriented, computer-resistant "tech"
writer that I am, I fear being left behind. Am I the only one in 
this position? 

"Admitting ignorance is the first step toward knowledge..." or some
such nonsense.....    &)

(pre-excuse for babbling on)

PGP is really cool in that it can electronically emulate real life
trust.

Let's say that I've trust Brian, and that I think he's not easily
duped.  If Brian says "This is Johnny, he's pretty cool, and he's not
a narc :)," then I believe that this person really is Johnny.

In PGP, Brian does this by signing Johnny's key. Now if Johnny sends
me his key, even though I've never met him, I know that Brian thinks
he's Johnny, and therefore I "trust" that he's Johnny.

What if I don't trust Brian all that much? Perhaps he gets in the
habit of introducing people before he actually meets them in person? I
can tell PGP that I don't trust Brian so much anymore (as an
introducer), and it keeps track of this. Anytime I'm wondering about
Johnny, I can check the the trust level of his identity.

What if I never meet Johnny, and the only people who sign his key are
"so-so"?  I can also tell PGP that if enough "so-so" people sign
Johnny's key, that I'll believe it really is Johnny.

For a real-life example, if Crunch meets me enough and gets to know
me, he'll probably sign my key. This doesn't mean he's responsible for
me being me, but what it does mean is that PGP users that trust him
will trust my identity. I might be able to converse with the radical
eurohackers he talks about, and they'd trust that I'd be a
hacker-dude, not some FBI poser.

This ability to identify via association on an entirely electronic
media is becoming more and more important as people's lives are more
closely bound to it.

I'm not saying drop everything and start FTPing :). But know what this
can do for you, and if you need it, it's out there.

Okay, I said something like "It's tougher for the cops to
infilitrate than you might think, because they've got to
decide what a Real Raver is supposed to look and sound like..."

Someday I'll learn to focus on the subject at hand, because
this remark seemed to set off some paranoid rushes around
here, of at least two varieties.

The first: But how do we know They haven't already infiltrated?
They could be among us right now!  They could be using paid
informants!  They could just get a warrant to raid our
computers!  Maybe they'll shut us all down for daring to say
something about illegal activities! 

Please chill out a bit on this stuff.  FMRs were getting
busted before they started, so we figure they're doing some
trivial easy things like reading the list.  We went to a
phone tree system, and this stopped happening.  So it looks
like they're not bothering with anything else, certainly not
risking EFF and ACLU and whoever else hitting them with
free speech law suits because they're raiding our computers... 

The second kind of paranoia is worse, though: What *do* real
ravers look like?  How am I ever going to make it onto the
trusted FMR phone tree list?  Maybe I don't look cool
enough.

Please don't run around feeling like an Outsider because
you're not on the phone tree list yet.  It's really not
*that* hard to become an insider, all you have to do is care
about it a bit.  

Couple of other things: The phone tree system really *does*
work.  There were just a few bugs in the system this one time.
There's not need to panic: the bugs will be fixed. 

And Geoff said exactly what I was thinking aout PGP: By all
means, play with encryption for practice and all, but it
really isn't the answer to our current problems.  Stop
treating the world like the nail 'cause you got a hammer in

list...

PGP...well, it so lame that we have to worry about our mail equalling postcards,
but that's life...maybe PGP is the way to go for things that you need to

I feel the need to reply to Sean's post, because he appears to be
making a serious and fundamental error in his description of the way
PGP handles trust.

It is *REALLY IMPORTANT* to understand these issues if you indent to
use PGP seriously....  if you don't understand how to manage your
keys, then you're going to mess up....  meake sure you read the volume
1 of the user's guide *before* you start making any serious use of
PGP...

If Brian signs Jognny's key, all it means is that Brian is vouching
for the fact that this key was indeed given to him by Johnny.  It
*does not* and *should not* mean that "Johnny's pretty cool -he's not
a narc" Brian could (and indeed should) sign the key if he's sure that
this is Johnny -- whether or not he trusts Johnny is a completely
different issue...

Key certificates are to do with peoples _identity_, nothing more...

What it allows me to do is be sure that the mail I receive from Johnny
*really is* from Johnny -- from the same Johnny that Brian knows.  I
can't assume that Johnny's cool, though, unless Brian actually tells
me so.....

This is a really important distinction, so at the risk of labouring a
point, I'm going to quote from the PGP 2.2 User's Guide.


  Bear in mind that your signature on a public key certificate does not
  vouch for the integrity of that person, but only vouches for the
  integrity (the ownership) of that person's public key.  You aren't
  risking your credibility by signing the public key of a sociopath, if
  you were completely confident that the key really belonged to him. 
  Other people would accept that key as belonging to him because you
  signed it (assuming they trust you), but they wouldn't trust that
  key's owner.  Trusting a key is not the same as trusting the key's
  owner.

I think part of the, problem is that FMR has become too well known to
be kept as an intimate/secret/clandestine/renegade rave.  Everyone knows
that it is the cool(tm) rave to go to, and just like Basics, ComeUnity 
and Groove Kitchen, it probably should be retired or held on a less
regular basis.  And although I understand the mystical allure of raving 
under a full moon, I personally feel this attachment to an astrologically 
imposed schedule somewhat lacking in imagination.

Until you all get jobs :-(

While we're on the subject of paranoia:
Let's say that a new religion/social movement/political party with an 
uncertain anti-establishment agenda started to spring up among thousands
of people in every major city throughout the world.  Let's say that this
movement is organized through a sophisticated web of computer and 
telecommunication networks with fully incorporated encription techniques
and secret meeting places.  Massive numbers of new members are being lured
into this movement every week through the use of music, newsletters and 
drugs.  A potential threat to the current order?  Something to be watched
by the powers-that-be?  Let's hope that raving continues to be percieved
(for now) as just another passing fad; kids staying up late dancing to silly
music.

BTW, tomorrow is Channeling.  A few of us SFRavers had a BLAST at the
last one, although past performance is no garauntee of future yield.

I made no serious fundamental error at all, either in intent or in the
expression of that intent. Read my sentence again. I never stated or
implied anything other than "If I trust Brian as an introducer and
Brian says Johnny is Johnny, then I believe that Johnny is Johnny."

This doesn't mean anything about Johnny's character. It's all about
identity and the belief of who is who. In real life, we see people
from day to day, and it's pretty easy to tell that the person you're
talking to is the same one you talked to yesterday. Not so on an
electronic medium. Hell, we're almost to the point where we can make
realistic computer generated images of people. That's why public key
encryption technology, zero knowledge proofs, etc. are becoming
important nowdays. In 10 years, they'll be seamlessly integrated into
the medium. In 20 years, you'll have as much confidence (maybe more)
about electronic interactions as personal ones.

Cryptography is a hobby of mine. Quiz: How was DES weakened by
reducing the key length to 56 bits?

Remember that there are many schools of astrological thought, all astrologers
are not mystics, some look at the movements of the planets like you look
at the movements of the hands of your watch.  Do the hands (or LCDs) exert
some "unseen force" that compells humans to go to their cars en masse and
head for their abode between 4:30 and 6:00 pm on 5 successive days or do they
simply mark a traditional pattern, bear in mind that most astrological 
thought (at least here in the west) has its roots in the metaphorical
interpretation of seasonal phenomena i.e. Astrology as we practice it gets
most of its symbolism from what the landscape of Northern Europe does at it
progresses through the seasons, most of the signs have the qualities of 
what is going on IN THE EARTH during that season.  From a mundane perspective
societies that had less free time them we do, were very linked to the growth
and hunting cycles of nature around them, WHICH MOST DEFINATELY WERE INFLUENCED
BY AT LEAST THE SUN AND THE MOON, now the other planets, well... I don't know,
but realize that if a child is born during harvest time, when everbody is
running around working, will get a different level of attention then a child
born during midsummer, from a purely freudian perspective the quality and
level of attention that the mother bestows on the child during those eary
months CAN have lasting effects on the personality of the being.

Do I believe in Astrology? Well I don't lay much credance to the daily horoscope
and I don't have the same beleifs that most astrologers have but I do know
the lingo and the mind set and it is an excellent way to converse with other
people about the nature of psyches (whether it is accurate or not) sorta like
using hacking metaphors to describe life :). I think that 80% of what goes
as astrological knowledge is superstition but then I think that many 
astrologers can help people not because of astrology but because the astrology
gives them an excuse to use faculties of their minds that they normally don't
use.  When Jung did astrological research he found that it was hard to
do this accurately because astrologers would (by synchronistic occurances)
stack the deck so to speak of cases, it goes back to lee observations in the
quantum physics domain of the effect of an observer on the fabric of reality
itself.

The FMR people do this at the FULL MOON because it is an easy focal point
for people around the globe,  the Full Moon happens at the same instant
around the world, (it doesn't move through time zones) Its relatively
easy to calculate (humans have been doing it for at least 10s of thousands of
years), and provides a link to the natural cycles of our planet which we
in our technological, urgan based civilization has completely lost track of.

I agree,  as it would reach those that are NOT on the internet or
have omputers etc..     I'm just proposing that we EXPERIMENT with
the possibilities of PGP use as a parallel system of notification
of FMR's.     In other words,   we have a legit application for
PGP here.     I also agree and cannot argue the point that PGP
is somewhat difficult to use,    but thats what I'm here for,  to
make it easier to use,  and to teach people about it.

So,  my proposal will be to put together a working group of interested
ravers who might want to participate in this experiment.   So far,
Sean has come forth with some good solid ideas and offerred to help
out.    Any other takers?

Once I get a group of people together who want to particiapte in this
experiment,  my plan is to take it "off-line" from the sfraves mailing
list,  and give ocassional reports on our findings.   And/or announce
the raves that we'll attend where key exchages can take place.

Others can then participate as they see fit.   Does this idea sound

The flaw in your logic is that you're assuming that the only place to

Well, I guess geocentricity is more inclusive than ethnocentricity, but I'm

opportunity to learn lessons.  You may like the lessons or think them stupid.

3.  There are no mistakes, only lessons.  Growth is a process of trial

4.  A lesson is to be repeated until learned.  A lesson will be

5.  Learning lessons does not end.  There is no part of life that does

7.  Others are merely mirrors of you.  You cannot love or hate 
something about another person unless it reflects to you something you 
love or hate about yourself.

8.  What you make of your life is up to you.  You have all the tools 
and resources you need.  What you do with them is up to you.  The 
choice is yours.

9.  Your answers lie inside you.  The answers to life's questions lie 
inside you.  All you have to do is look, listen, and trust.

10.  You will forget all this.

Subject: An announcement of an experiment I'm proposing

Mike says:

>Check it out--the phone tree really is the only thing that works...

I agree,  as it would reach those that are NOT on the internet or
have omputers etc..     I'm just proposing that we EXPERIMENT with
the possibilities of PGP use as a parallel system of notification
of FMR's.     In other words,   we have a legit application for
PGP here.     I also agree and cannot argue the point that PGP
is somewhat difficult to use,    but thats what I'm here for,  to
make it easier to use,  and to teach people about it.

So,  my proposal will be to put together a working group of interested
ravers who might want to participate in this experiment.   So far,
Sean has come forth with some good solid ideas and offerred to help
out.    Any other takers?

Once I get a group of people together who want to particiapte in this
experiment,  my plan is to take it "off-line" from the sfraves mailing
list,  and give ocassional reports on our findings.   And/or announce
the raves that we'll attend where key exchages can take place.

PGP aint wirth a shit if poor key management is used,   so our goal is
to experiment with PGP in such a way as to clearly define a good solid and
secure key management system for any closed group of people who might
want to participate.

Others can then participate as they see fit.   Does this idea sound
like a feasable one?

I remain...

Subject: Re: the paranoia-caution spectrum

Go to a rave that night beforehand and you'll find out.  Also, I've called
Zanzibar as a last resort once and they told me right over the phone.  Also
I think the danger is more in releasing info too early, not all this police
b.s. (not that it might not be true, I'm just calling it b.s. because it is
wheather it's true or not) so if you realy don't have any way I'll call you.
If you were a cop, you'd have plenty of ways to find out so I'm not worried
about telling some net personality that I actualy know better than people
at raves who tell each other, having never met with no problem.  I mean for
you to miss it because of this security issue is b.s., in my opinoin.

Subject: How to meet people

The way I met people on this list was to reply privately to someone
whose post I liked and ask them if they were going to any raves in the
near future and express the desire to meet them. Then set up where and
when you might meet and what you'll be wearing. Say next to the smart
bar at 1:00am or whatever. You do this a few times and not only do you
get to meet new friends, eventually when you're known and trusted you
WILL find out about the FMR's.

Hello All, 

For the last week or so, I have been silently lurking.  I decided 
to join the lunch today to check things out.  I was very pleased 
with what I found.  Everyone there was very friendly and completely 
down to earth (not that I thought it would be any 
differently mind you).  I would definetely enjoy the energy from 
being at a rave with this group of people. 
So I am basically writing as a sort of hello of sorts, and will be 
posting now that I am out from behind the shadows.

Subject: PGParanoia

I assert that sending email is as secure as your telephone.  Yes, cops, the
FBI, the CIA, and the KGB can all tap your phone, but are they?  Truly only
the paranoid and the stupid believe that they are being monitored 24 hours a
day.  Senoir Crunch may have had more past experience in the past with this,
but how many of us carry around his reputation?

This is why I have been ignoring the recent ballyhoo over PGP, cypherpunks,
and encryption.  First off, it is a pain in the ass.  Second, I really don't
care if someone else reads my mail.  I don't send off my PIN numbers or
ultraconfidential embarrassing secrets in email.  I don't mail them in
invisible ink via the postal mail either.

Sending PGP codes to your buddies may be fun, but it also encourages closing
down the openess that raves strive for.  As previously stated, the sfraves
community is SMALL in comparison to the rave community.  I really doubt that
the cops are getting any info at all from sfraves.

The day I have to own a PGP key to talk with someone is the day I stop talking
to them.

Subject: This Week's Rave Guide


Hi all!  I'm your guest host this week for the SFR calendar.  
Brian's out in Boston or somewhere now, but should be back next week.

My recommendations for this weekend are (may I have the envelope, please)

Thursday - Your Sisters' House.  Great time last week.

Friday - Channeling has received many accolades in the past.  Check it
	out!  If you want a pre-party, or you're not going to be out
	late, try Mission Rock or Zanzibar, which have both been consistently
	good.  After-party at Splash (is the pool open yet?)

Saturday - Another Final Groove Kitchen :).
	Spirit of the Tree is likely to be Big (tm), music should be
	good, but I don't know if the crowd will be.  There are a
	couple of new weeklies, Nature at the Sound Factory in SF,
	and Funky Underground in San Jose.

Sunday - the Tilt-a-Whirl lineup looks good.  I wonder what happened
	with the park raves?

-Derek

Subject: Penelope's Web


A friend of mine (and Geoff's), Melissa, is organizing Penelope's Web,
a two day celebration July 31 - August 1 which will take place roughly
3 hours north of SF.  People will be camping out, there will be food
for everyone, and Your Sister's House will be running a day care tent
(they have a lot of great ideas!) too.  Basically, to quote Melissa
"the only thing similar to a rave is that there will be house music"
--- IMHO, the plans should transcend the term RAVE if even half of
them happen.  Proceeds to benefit a battered women's shelter (can't
remember which one at the moment, sorry).

Anyhoo, Melissa is looking for female DJs as she's planning to have
the entire event DJed by women.  (OK, well, she told a couple guys
they could DJ if they dressed in drag and let her make them up, but
that's the exception and not the rule.)

If you know a good female DJ, please have her leave a message at
415-765-7671.  Demo tapes are of course very helpful.  Also feel free
to contact me directly if you have any questions.

There are other things that One Nation Productions will need help
with, when plans firm up, I'll let you all know what's going on.

Had a great lunch, heavy turnout (around 15 people) and am looking
forward to Your Sister's House tonight!

Subject: I WILL be at Channeling rave on Fri nite..

  Earlier I had posted some ideas on experimenting with PGP in uses related
to helping ravers communicate on a secure channel.    Lots of people have
asked me questions about PGP and I am always available via Email to help
them in learning about PGP's capabilities and applications.

  For those living in the Bay area,   and who are going to the Channeling
rave on Friday evening will get a chance to meet me,   and I would like to
discuss some of my ideas on what we can do to experiment with PGP on how we
can use it within a close knit group for ravers,  so when you want to take
a break from dancing,   consider approaching me so we can go to chill out
area and talk.

  Look for an older chap with big bushey beard,  wearing a light colored
T-shirt,  and baggy pants.    Will probably be spening lots of time dancing,
with a somewhat wimpy style.  Don't know if I can stay till breakfast,  but
I'll try to conjour enough energy to do it,  but also depends on where the 
rave is located,  parking situation,   etc.

I will no doubt be spending time in chill out area (Provided there IS one) 
doing stretching exercises,  that might help identify me.   I think some 
of the DJ's will know and recognize me,  so you can ask them if they are 
not busy.

  As has been discussed many times,  I have some solutions for using
PGP for such things as FMR location info,   and other things.   I have some
ideas on how we can effectivly put together groups of people (Who have
net and PC access) who could be the "HUB" for info distribution,   but a
network of trusted people have to be built up first.   It is also important
to understand that the current phone trees should still be used as before
for FMR announcements or whatever,   and in parallel,   this small experimental
group can be built as a backup.  The Cypherpunks have at length discussed
many different trust mechanisms,  some of which may have direct application
here in sfraves to weed out the porcine folks.    A pig with PGP is of
NO consequence if nobody is willing to sign their keys and vouch for him.

  Remember,  what we are doing here is experimental only,   and we plan on
doing it with only a small group of people initially,   based on personal
contacts at raves (Thus providing opportunity to know each other,  and
build trust among them).   Then,  as we experiment with new key management
schemes,  I am hoping an acceptable solution may converge out of these
experiments,  and the group should naturally grow and flower into somthing
real,  after the bugs have been worked out.

  Besides me,  Geoff White is also a Cypherpunk,   and no doubt can help with
some of these ideas as well.    I am hoping that other sfraves folks might
become interested in Cypherpunks and participate in our causes.  So if you
are interested in participating in this experiment,  please let me know.

  I will need the following from you...  Your internet address,   and what 
machine or personal computer you have.   I don't have an IBM-PC,  so if someone
would bring floppy diskettes with PGP on it,   I can bring Mac version of a few
diskettes,  provided I can find some empty ones I can spare.

  Eventually,  it might be prudent for a few people to bring portables of
various kinds to raves for key signings,  PGP distributions,  or even for
people wanting to know how to use it.    That way,  when U want to take break
from dancing,   one can chill out and learn PGP,  make and sign keys,  get
to know one another,  etc.

  Take care,  see U at "Channeling",  and Rave on...

Subject: MotherEarthSoundSystem #3

Mother Earth #3 IS still happening.  The location will be the Ft. Funston
(sp?) beach, saturday night from sunset to sunirse (God(dess) willing). 
Like Your Sister's House (serious props to them), we're tring to take
raves to the next level.  In my case this means trying to create space in
which we can "practice reality."  In other words, we can come together to
discuss ideas, put them into practice, support each other when we fuck up
(as all humans invariably do at times) and plant the seeds for the future.
 Our "Sound System" is more a concept than one specific system.  We've
been able to keep the parties free by scrounging and accepting whatever
gifts come to us.  Anyone with ideas for making a permanent Mother Earth
Sound System, pelase get in touch with me.  So far, our weakest link is a
generator and finding locations.  (Not to mention everyone working on
"Rave Time" or "manyana syndrome. :) Still, it always happens at the last
minute.)  By the way, it was while dancing on the grass in the rain at C2
that I had the "vision" to get together a sound system and call it "Mother
Earth."  Before that night I was about ready to say goodbye to this scene
that has been my "house" for the past (almost) two years.

Once you've felt it, you won't ever want to give it up.
Live free,

A Current Afair is going to do an "expose'" on LSD's come back.  In the
clip someone supposedly says something about raves.  Does anyone know
what day/time/channel this will be airing in SF?  I think it might be
on *today*, but I'm not sure.

Except your missing my point my friend.  The organizers didn't
say I couldn't call anyone, they just don't want it broadcast on the
net.  So if I want to call this person or anyone else I have every
right too.  Last FMR I was at Berkeley square, where there was a
little rave thing going on.  Well, at this rave (and I'm sure every
other rave that night) people were exchanging location info with 
complete strangers.  I called Geoff at 12:00 and he told me he 
couldn't tell me yet and to call back later, so I did.  I ran up
to my friends to tell them the location and everyone in the whole
place already knew.  Then outside people who hadn't attended the
rave were coming up and people were giving them directions, so if
the organizers want to address security, this is the kind of thing
they need to wory about.  And we are better than Geoff's loose liped
friend because we won't release info before were supposed too and we
will include the "don't arrive before this time" or "don't park
there" parts of the instructions.

Anyway, that's how I feel.  If the organizers start requesting that
we not tell anyone except people we've known for 5.2 years than I
guess I won't but as far as I know they only have a problem with
the net because of a specific past incident.  Were the ones who
brought up the DEA, CIA, NSA, FBI, BATF, and local/state/federal
police spy conspiracy theories.

	If there is such a thing as heaven, I hope it is run by the
	same beautiful group of Women who run Your Sister's House.
	I had the BEST time!! It was really FUN!  I felt so supported,
	inspired, taken care of, nurtured, and challenged.  Even the sign
	that said "Please wash your dish and silverware (Mom's gone, help
	your sister)"  Was inspiring for me as a male, who can all to 
	easily fall into seeing women areound me as "mom". The energy wes
	definitely feminine, powerful but very friendly and loving.  YSH
	could become the hatching ground for future Rave Goddesses(tm)
	and maybe some Rave Gods(tm) can receive a much needed education
	on how to live with, love and support, powerful, independent, women.

	I can't wait for next Thursday!

	OH and I just gotta say that DJ DRC kicked some SERIOUS butt at
	YSH last night, By 1:30 the vibe was in full and complete effect,
	I felt incredibly free to dance anyway I wanted to,  I only saw one
	Shirtless Man(tm) type the whole night and he seemed pretty nervous!
	unfortunately I didn't hear the end of DRC's set 'cause
	I had to go help out at Challenge, MoonPup's "house party", which
	was really neat,  In fact it was so TOTALLY cool to go to some
	alternative "house party" type events which were so much more 
	cozy than the big Raves, (Which I love for different reasons)

				-G

	Everyone should check out YSH at least once, but don't bum rush
	It and make it crowded and spoil it, ya know!

sorry for the rather incomplete directions, hope this makes it a bit
clearer.  Ft. Funstun (sp?) is about five miles south of SF zoo on the
pacific ocean, not by Pt. Reyes.  The Pt. R. location didn't happpen for
various reasons, so we decided to do it by the city instead.  (maybe next
time up norht...)  Anyway, my home number is 510.549.6240.  Directions
will always be on my machine, or you can talk to a human being if i'm
home.  This is also a good way to say what you do/don't like about our
events so we can make 'em better.  After all, Mother Earth S.S. is
supposedly a collective whose members include everyone who shows up.  If
these directions aren't perfect, just keep looking for us, we'll be there,
or call my number to see if it has changed.  For anyone who wants to get
in touch with me, I'm around after 5p, M-Th, and all day Friday-Sunday.
  If you come Sat night, bring a flashlight and enough water (and other
things to keep you safe and happy out doors).  DJ lineup will be: Brad,
Stonie, Andy, and special guest Shoban (sp) from Space Time, plus some
other morning folks, provided we can go that long.  Also, since we're on
the spiritual/Mother Earth tip, we'll have ceremonies/rituals to mark
sunset, sunrise, and midnight, honoring the last quarter of the moon and
the life community we're all a part of, plus a new issue of our zine to
hand out.
Hope this has cleared up the confusion...

get outside, it's nice!

Subject: Channeling -- yuck

Channeling was held at a military installation in the town of San
Mateo.  MAJOR cop presence there -- due to the military nature of
the site they couldn't shut it down, but they intruded and
intimidated and generally got in the way.  As a result, the thing
never seemed to get going.  Many people left when they got there,
others went in and then came out soon afterwards.

A bunch of SFRavers etc. headed up to 16th/Harrison, where we caught
Garth, and later Ghost spinning "Rave Top 40" (including
"Funkytown" ...  can you believe :)?).  Only $5 but unfortunately
the vibe wasn't there and the sound system is shitty (yes yes I know,
we didn't really expect otherwise).

About 5am someone showed up from Channeling and said it was still
dead.

Oh well, can't win 'em all.

Subject: MotherEarth#3

It's sunday everning after a good day's sleep...  Mother Earth #3 went off
but also had some dissapointments.  We got shut down temporarily after
about an hour of slamming tunes by Brad.  This was a bummer especially
because we had to carry the sound system up a huge hill just as we we're
getting all the stiffness shaken out from carrying it down.  The Fort
Funston location turned out to be not wothwhile (next time I'm scouting
locations personally) due to extreme geography and "political presense"
(lots of blue meanines).  We ended up at the same place as Straight Up
Funk for awhile, drew a good sized crowd that was getting bigger when 5-0
showed up and said shut down.  It was nice to meet some more SF Ravers
face to face.  After being chased out from there, we headed over to the
supposedly "old reliable" Berkeley marina, only to find another party in
the process of being busted.  We ended up at Aquatic Park, with the tables
under a gorgeous willow tree.  By this time the "crowd" was about a dozen
incredibly dedicated family members.  I guess after carrying the system up
and down cliffs all night they we're going to get some dancing in no
matter what.  WARNING: when doing raves in parks, check for sprinklers
before they come on.  We got "sprinkled," but no damage to the equipment,
even though some of my records are now a bit damp.  Big rocks help hold
down sprinkler heads :)...  The moon finally came out about early in the
morning, and Corina led us in a moon ceremony.  As everyone howled, Scott
faded the music back in and we danced for a while longer before chilling
out until sunrise.  One neat thing that happend:  While we we're relaxing
in the pre-dawn glow, a man approched us asking for a light for his smoke.
C.T. started telling him about what we we're doing and about the scene and
how we're about welcoming everyone and having fun together.  This guy said
he was from the barrio in Richmond and that he had come down that moring
just to get away and think for awhile.  He said he was bisexual and that
he could be killed for that where he was from.  C.T. told him he could
hang out with us, that being bi was alright, and that we we're there if he
wanted to be with us.  This practically made him break down in tears, and
he went off to think for awhile.  Well, he took off before I could give
him our number, but this stoked me that we we're doing something
worthwhile.  I mean, this is someone who needed the message of House, and
he heard it that morning.  I hope he finds us again.
tired, sore, and happy,

Subject: Job(s) of interest to SFR people -in MenloPark


1 or 2  Unusual Positions Available-
At New Company/Service/Store Opening Next Week In Menlo Park.

After a year and a 1/2 of planning, Lambda Voice & Graphic Systems is
opening an office in downtown Menlo Park, as well as a retail/self-service 
storefront currently named "The MultiMedia and Video Center" (at least
that's how we're registered with San Mateo County).
A description of the unusual services we'll offer is the best way to
describe the position(s) available.

 1- We'll be offering full digital communications (using in-bound T1 lines)
at a service bureau level, including, but not limited to customized
voice-mail with voice recognition, fax-mail and fax-on-demand
services, group mailboxes and notification, regular & wireless
e-mail/voice-mail integration, text-to-speech services, advanced
cellular services, paging, programmable call-message forwarding
services, remote call forwarding/messaging services, 800 service
with ANI, ISDN, video-conferencing. community information hotlines
with or without group mailboxes and out-dialing. Alternative internet
services may be offered as well.

 While we'll offer these services to the community at large,
as well as 800-access state-wide and nationally, we will give
preference and offer special services to certain not-for-profit,
education & information services, community service organizations,
and local bands/musicians for the purpose of Bay area networking,
and promotion of independent music & video productions.  

 2- In addition, custom design and integration of interactive
computer/telephony/voice response and multimedia systems will be
offered to companies and organizations. Hardware & software
computer-telephony solutions will be marketed.
We are especially committed to offering services and custom 
designed turn-key systems, at reasonable prices, to community
service organizations, not-for-profit groups, and small businesses.

3- The "retail storefront" component will offer demonstrations of the
above hardware/software, as well as a self-service (by the hour
or day) video editing, multimedia & animation production, sound editing
& FX, color graphic design, and internet/database access work-stations.
There will be a small library of books, periodicals, and CD-ROMs.

 There will be an Amiga2000 & 4000/video-toaster, OS/2 & Windows
multi-media, Macintosh, NextStep486, and possibly SGI/Indigo, hopefully
all tied together on a network.
Other hardware and operating systems will be added as demand requires.

POSITIONS  AVAILABLE:
 #1- One person (to start full or part-time depending on several variables
like the filling of position #2-below), whose responsibilities will mostly
be for item 3 and marketing of item 1 (above).
 Should have intermediate or greater knowledge and experience using
one of the listed operating systems/hardware and/or video editing.
 Ability to learn the other systems may be required, and preference
will be given to someone who is experienced in using Amiga, Macintosh,
OS/2 & Windows, the video-toaster, and multimedia editing/production.
 This position will be mostly days, but some evenings and weekends
may be required.
 STUDENTS, who are available for the SUMMER, and possibly after or
not after that, are ENCOURAGED TO apply, as this will be our opening
and experimental period (for hours of operation as well as services).

 NOTE: Preference will be given to someone who can accept a lower
salary, but with the added bonuses of profit-sharing and UNLIMITED
use of available equipment.
 In other words, you won't have to sit around all day or evening, getting
bored, if no one's there, you can make your own videos or animation,
or even study if you're taking a class.

 #2- One part-time, to start, or contract position, (OR FULL-TIME if you
can fill both this job and #1 above) whose primary responsibility is
writing custom software (in C for OS/2) for the digital, voice,
and video services & systems (see item 2 above).
 This is NOT to develope the main voice-operating software, but code
that allows various multitasking operations and devices to "talk to" or
call each other, i.e. via DLL's.
 Must be able to program using provided API's under OS/2 & Windows,
and some MS-DOS C applications.
 There are plans and possibilities to market some of our systems
nationally (see NOTE under position #1 above).
 Knowledge or experience with DSP technology, specifically the
TI - TMS320C25, UNIX-C, Novell networks, TCP/IP, analog & digital
telephony,video compression, Amigados, AREXX, and REXX would be useful.

Please send resumes and questions via e-mail, or try reaching me,
David Holleb, at 415-327-7629(office); 415-327-9562(home) with
voice-mail, and 1-800-VOICE44, but I may be hard to reach
as we're busy moving into the building starting June 12th.

So you want to be a DJ (a beginners perspective)

Here's a compilation of notes I've been maintaining since 3/93.
Please email me your input/comments, they will be read. 
-Pat Lui (plui@iossvr.gm.hac.com) 

On record collection and buying...
Plui asked: What do you look for in a good track? When you go record hunting,
do you already have an idea of what you're looking for (a track with a 
particular feel or groove; a particular song)?

Lee wrote
the rhythm section is a very important element in house music for me;
strong bass and drums are the first things i look for in buying music. the
other parts are important also, but you gotta have strong percussion. over
top of that, i like originality--no sampling/stealing of other people's
tunes. when you listen up to 50 new songs a week, you don't want to have
to listen to the same copied riff(sp?) over and over again...
 

XDZebra Wrote
Vinyl in the long run is cheaper, but I'm still glad I spent the extra 
money on CDs.  They last and they're easier to tote.  Plus I can listen 
to  them practically anywhere.  I think they're easier to mix with as
well.  Vinyl is cool for rare stuff and samples.  I get a ton of vinyl 
from thrift stores for 50 cents.

records can be tough..  you obviously can't take out a bank loan to get 
what you need, but you can't just pick up only 2 records each month 
either..  my suggestion would be to TRY to be VERY choosy with your 
records..  there is SO much music out there that goes almost unnoticed 
that 4 months from now you can still be playing it, since you might be 
the only one who ever plays it..  kimball collins is highly regarded as

about playing certain songs that are several months old - of course NO 
ONE else plays those songs, and many are hard to find, but still..

another thing about this style of music is that the records are printed 
for such a short period of time..  if you don't get a record within about 
a month or two of when it is released, you stand little chance of ever 
getting it..  but this is definately a _good_ thing..  say you go out and 
buy a couple things on my review list - maybe 'hands of stone' by no 
mass..  it is on a small label called apple records - there is a VERY 
good chance no dj in your area will EVER play it - if they do play it, no 
one will really remember it..  four months down the road, you might 
finally start djing and you PLAY it!  does anyone know it?  no.  can 
anyone even BUY it, if they want to?  no.  even though it is older it 
would add a personal atmosphere to your set, since no other dj is playing 
it, and other djs can't jump on the bandwagon because they can no longer 
buy it..

so with buying records, until you start djing often, concentrate NOT on 
whats HOT NOW, but concentrate on real quality stuff that a) won't get 
overplayed and b) will still sound good in a few months..  stick to 
smaller labels - guerilla and cowboy stuff is great, but more likely to 
get overplayed and easier to find for everyone else..

if you follow that rule, you'll find that a couple months down the road 
you actually have a very unique collection and you can STILL play almost 
every record that you own!

On Playing the Set...
Plui asked: how much (if any) of your set is preplanned?

XDZebra wrote
Usually the intro, the end, and possibly one or two mixes that I've worked out
previously.

What I try to do is a completely different set each time.  This is why I don't
like top ten lists, since I have no idea what that would be for me.  There are
a few songs I favor from set to set, but I certainly don't do a "hot rotation"
thing.

...there is a certain feeling of euphoria and creativity to do it on the fly.


Stowy wrote
I have alot of songs that go good against each other that are implanted in 
my head forever. Usually, I'll just play whatever comes to mind.


Desi The Three Armed Wonder Comic wrote
depends.  sometimes i make tapes and i hear brilliant mixes that just
have to be duplicated live, sometimes i just wing it...

...the best way to fight that (boring pre-planned sets) is to have as many
records as you can get your hands on and learn them all pretty well.
once you know where the changes are and what the styles are, you can
arrange good sets that aren't repetitive.


BLURrrr wrote
i think it is a good idea to have some idea of certain songs that you 
want to play, but its a bad idea to have a set planned with no tendency 
to change it mid-mix..

i'm not one of those who organizes his records by bpm order or anything, 
so when i am preparing to spin i tend to group certain songs near the 
front of my crate, the ones i want to focus on this night, and the songs 
i want to stay away from for the most part, i group near the back..

another reason why i think overplanning hurts in a live setting is that 
different crowds will have different likes and dislikes..  with the first 
3 or 4 songs you can feel out an audience and then, hopefully, take it 
from there..

i also like to try and build through most of my set and bring the crowd 
to its most frenzied point, and then start slowly coming down..  if you 
have what you want to play strictly planned out, you won't be as likely 
to effectively use the songs you have to take the crowd to the 
appropriate level at the appropriate time..

BUT!, you really do need to have some sense of what you want to play, 
because otherwise i find i fall into a rut of using the same songs at the 
same time.. 

see, with djing at raves or rave-like events, it is like a trip you must 
take the people on..  the best djs will not only have good records, but 
know when and how to play them..  this is a _very_ important thing!

you are not just playing songs, or mixing songs, you are creating a new 
world and atmosphere that the participants will temporarily succumb to..  
if you just play records, people might dance, people might be happy, but 
you aren't _taking_ the crowd anywhere..

--------------------------------------------------
On gear
Here's some random notes I've compiled from BPM and rave lists, as well as
some of my own notes.

-Turntables
The Technics SL1200 series is the most frequently mentioned table on
the lists. It has a high-torque motor which brings the plate to the
correct speed very very quickly. Various modifications are usually
made (by the user) to improve stability and enhance playability.
The BPM list frequently gets into the technical aspects of
customization of the 1200. A 1200mkII can be mail ordered for $400.

-CD Players
The Denon 2000F dual cd player is rack mountable, and has  +-8% pitch control
and 'pitch bend' buttons for beat matching. It can be mail ordered for $950

XDZebra wrote (of the Denon)
I got mine for $900 USA, but this was through a friend.  It was the best money
spent on my system yet.

An idiot could use it.  The first time I used one was at a rave where I
demo'd.  I learned it from scratch in a few minutes and was mixing with no
problems after that.

-Mixers
Gemini, MTX, Numark, Furman, Vestax...
I don't have much knowledge of each, but they should all perform the same
function. There should be a variety of inputs for turntables, cd players, etc.
There should also be a variety of outputs for the PA and a perhaps a line-out
for tape recorders. The mixing panel should be straight forward, easy to use in 
dim lighting situations.  You should be able to assign each input (turntable,cd)
to one of two 'source' sliders via switches (transformer switches). There should 
also be a crossfade control that allows you to mix between the two sources.
There are also sampling mixers that will record and loop a part of the track
that you are playing. 

Prices can be as low as $130 for a Gemini Scratchmaster to $1000s for the 
sampling mixers. I am renting a $300 Yamaha MJ100 for $30 a month. Many
stores will have mixers for rent, I'd suggest renting a few different ones 
before you buy, make sure you feel comfortable with the one you plan to get.

XDZebra wrote
I purchased a Biamp 5500 and I've been very pleased with it.  The only
drawback with it is the lack of transform switches.  It has two phono inputs,
six line inputs, and one switchable phone/line.  The best part about it has
got to be the cuing, which can put the monitor line in one ear and the cue
line in the other.  It can also do a sort of "blend/preview" function.  This
can substitute well for when there isn't a monitor present.  The sliders are
on bearings and look easily enough replaced, I've put them through plenty of
abuse and they've come out well.  Right now, I'm looking into a higher model
of Biamp because (believe it or not), I've run out of inputs.  However, if
they don't have transform on any other models, I'll probably go with a Rane.

Subject: Weekend Review

Well I really wish Mess 3 hadn't gotten busted! Great vibe, killer evening.
Unfortunately, I didn't have the energy to make it to berkeley and as I was
with friends that were under 21, GK was not an option. Sooooo, I made the
big mistake of going to Tekno Tribe :( WEIRD ):  With the exception of
Tony who was on when we got there the music was just really flat. Tony
however shredded as ususal.

But music aside, this was by far the most commercial "rave" I've ever seen.
It was more like a circus. They had all these acts, right in the middle of
the dance floor. Fire jugglers, futuristic live mannequins posturing...
"Club types" everywhere, an army of people at the door trying to sell "e" to
anyone and everyone that passed them. Really depressing. If this was what
the summer is going to bring we really need to focus on putting on our own
events with the URSS, Mess and whatever else comes along...

Also dismayed to note on the back panel of the huge 4-page Cyberfest flyer
that it is in fact a Cool World... though ther will be a "Wicked Sanctuary".
Seems like conglomeration seems to be a new feature of the scene...Any
comment Wicked?

Still reeling...

Subject: Solstice Details

These are the absolute and final details for Solstice, presented by Taste in
Utah. 

June 18th - Friday
Location: Mountain peak near Salt Lake City
Time: Sunset (about 9:45 now) to sunrise  (6ish)
There may or may not be a map point for this one.  I'm not sure of the
necessity and a lot of people know the location already.  The thing that
counts is that it is near, but outside of Salt Lake County.  If anyone tries
to shut us down maliciously, they'll be calling the wrong policemen.  I went
and mountain biked around this location last Sunday, and it was perfect sunny
weather, but a bit chilly.  Bring a sweater!

June 19th - Saturday
Location: Knolls recreation area.  Exit 41 off of I-80.  About 80 miles west
of Salt Lake City.
Time: Sunset to ????
We were originally going to do this the first night, but decided on the second
night, so we can take it into Sunday if we want.  You can camp, shoot off
fireworks, run around naked, or drop bombs on the complementary Airforce
bombing range six miles down (we should have great bass).  You can pretty much
get away with doing anything you want here, because it is BLM land and nobody
cares.  Just clean up after yourself.

Cost: Our absolute cost on this is about $220.  We have a good, but not
extremely powerful sound system and a capable generator.  Gas and time have
not been included.  We are requesting donations, but not demanding them.  If
you want to see more of this activity, show your appreciation and donate.
Otherwise it is back to the warehouses and possible shutdowns one hour after
you pay your $10.  If you want to sell cookies, t-shirts, drinks, or whatever,
feel free, but donate generously.

DJ's:  Right now, it is still just me.  A guy told me he was going to fly in
several DJs, but after meeting him, I believe he is planning to use a UFO for
this purpose.  Anyone, anyone can DJ who wants to.  The only thing I ask is
that people can dance or listen to it.  In other words, calypso could be cool,
but Anthrax may cause some problems.

For up to date information regarding both nights, call the Taste hotline at
801-461-3375.   The whole weekend is weather dependent and right now, there
aren't any indoor alternatives.  So call the hotline before going anywhere.

Mark,

I have two CDs of what you're looking for:

GROUP:  QUADROPHIONA		LABEL:  BMG
TITLE:  COZMIC JAM		YEAR:  1991
SONGS TO LOOK FOR:		TYPE OF MUSIC:  RAP/TECHNO
	QUADROPHONIA
	DJOUM 1000
	COZMIC JAM
	COZM' AND OVO
	THE NINE LIVES OF PITOU


GROUP:  KRAFTWERK 		LABEL:  ELEKTRA
TITLE:  THE MIX			YEAR:  1991
SONGS TO LOOK FOR:		TYPE OF MUSIC:  REALLY FUCKED UP TECHNO!:)
	{ALL OF 'M}		

I hope this can be of assistance if you haven't heard of these groups. 
Kraftwerk is probably your best bet for what you want (more blippy than
bassey) and they sound a lot older than most techno (this is a CD that has
songs remixed from the early '80s -- very experimental -- and all German).
 The Quadrophonia CD's songs that I listed are short, but they are all
quite computer generated and neat sounding for a hype loop or something.

hello folx!
well, i went to berkezeley last night, but somehow for me it did not really
come together until carlos, around 2 am. garth and jeno did their thing
which worked well at times, but it did not quite 'take off'. anyway , the
place is great, about the size of thr troc', hexagonal. it is right near the
bay and has a good 'feel'. did not see anyone from the list, and in general,
the attendance  was low, so there was barely a fritical mass after about
1 am. i also heard that thirl-a-whirl will be doing something sunday mornings
with goa gil, so look out for that, if u like gg.
i can't really add much to what geoff said aobut ysh. it is trulu great stuff,
some heavy  positive magick vibe present! let's help it be/come everywhere.
i also went to the endup in wed., but did not really like it. there was a
certain 'klub'feel to it and there was little I-contact. musick was quite
good, the usual funk groove plus some seriously hard tekno too, which
worked well. so that's my report for this week.
see you on the dance plane soon

I have to say, with some regret, that this is true.  There are a LOT
of people out there who have never done it and will never need to do
it to power their luv phasors... but there are enough people out there
who cling so strongly to their society-imposed models of interaction
which run counter to the openness and freedom found at "good vibey"
raves, that they often dampen the spirit at events, creating a "domino
effect", so to speak.  I say this with regret because it shows how far
distanced American society sometimes is... anyways, I think a more 
sinister aspect of this is the dreaded "bad E", which, if we wanna get
doomsdayish, is more a threat to our culture than anything else.  

*Donning my flame-retardant nuclear-bomb-resistant spacesuit*

Forget speed, bad E will kill the scene quicker than anything else.

Yes yes yes, you *don't* need it, if you already know most of what it
has to teach you.  And one of our goals as a scene should be to teach
others about its message so that we'll NEVER need to have it.  But until
that mem reaches enough of the population to take off on its own, MDMA
will be the main way for people to discover this for themselves.

Unless, of course, they pay $25 for a "hit" of speed or a "dose" of
aspirin, being told it was E.  Please, it's like telling a starving
nomad in the desert you're selling him lemonade and what you deliver
is Crystal Lite powder.

>2) SF no longer has a "rave" scene.
(comments about positivity that don't seem to be present anymore)

I dunno, I was deliriously happy the morning of the May FMR, and more
than a couple occasions over the past few months.  The scene has changed
a lot over the past year, and parties aren't quite batting 1000 like they
used to.... but it's still there, and the summer looks really bright to
me.

1)  We were told the same thing about Palo Alto cops, and yet in
May there were 800 people dancing next to the PA airport and no one
official showed up till quarter to nine in the morning.  So, the 
lesson I got from that was, the most crucial aspects of location are
being somewhere not patrolled, and being far enough away that no 
residents are bothered.  The PA site fit that, as did the water temple.
When I tried to throw something at the Water Temple when Dante was
in town (which was foiled due to flakiness on the sound system provider's
part) there were maybe 10 people there on a Wednesday night from 2:30
am to 6am, and a total of three cars passed along the road, none of
which were cops.  So it looks like maybe the Water Temple wasn't quite
out of the way enough.

Well, I was sorta thinking maybe a crowd of 100-200 wouldn't have gone
noticed whereas a party of 600 would be... plus, if we still support the
theory that the SF cops are on the link somewhere and inform other police
agencies, the FMR's have a security link whereas a small party might not.
Had a small party happened there it may have been reasonable then to 
suggest it as a potential FMR site. Am I treating this too much like a
science and not like an art?

write a small program that filters out all sfraves mail except those
with the words "Full" or "FMR" in them; or simply to throw everything
out except mail from the 24 hours preceding a full moon.

>I realize security was the original concern but I just don't buy it
>Who is reading?
>Local city police all over the bay?
>The DEA?

Who knows.  I would give a week's pay to have a lunch conversation with
a police officer, to ask them to what level they are concerned about us,
and the clincher of course being that they tell everything.  Until that
point, we should only presume the worst when security seems necessary.

>I doubt anyone is monitoring 24hrs a day - even on evenings of a full moon
>It just doesn't seem like an efficient use of police time

Definitely agreed.  Though who said the cops were efficient?  The whole
war on drugs is a model of inefficiency.

>I ask from those in-the-know what ever lead to the belief that this list
>was a leak to the police?

At the May 1992 FMR, the location was announced a couple of days in 
advance.  I found out about it and posted it the night before.  Supposedly
a DJ at Stanford who was on the list (or had a friend who was) picked
the directions off the net and announced them over his radio show, resulting
in 1200 people, mostly from the area (since it was held maybe 10 minutes from
Stanford) descending upon a residential neighborhood on a house that could
hold maybe 200 people tops.  The police basically invoked the fear of god into
the FMR promoters, and after then the people who own the house were kicked
out.  There was no full moon in June because of it.  Word got back to the
organizers that this was the cause of the bust - so for awhile SFRaves was
a dirty word among them (we more than redeemed ourselves with the sites
found since then).  So basically, since then everyone involved has been
sorta security-minded about the whole thing.

In December, when the party was busted before the sound system even arrived,
it became glaringly obvious the police were getting the info somehow.  The 
most obvious source was that it was on the Wicked hotline, so the directions
haven't been on there since.  Apparently our security measures have worked,
since the May 93 FMR went on until late in the morning without detection.

On the other hand, there have been a couple renegades, small parties, announced
on the main list which did NOT garner police attention.

Hmm... this kinda rubs me the wrong way, just because I think it would
have been better to tell her to NOT arrive until after 2, and to call
all her friends and tell them the same, instead of intentionally lying.
One because I wonder how many hours were burned up by people driving to
a different location or fretting about the site, and two because in the
information age it's getting harder and harder to lie so I avoid it like
the plague now (which is why I would make an awful politician ;)

But on all other accounts, I back you up, Geoff.

Subject: Solstice - carpooling?


Okay, despite having very little money and being away from the bay
area for a long time, I'm seriously considering driving to Pete's
Solstice party this weekend.  I know that after the tone-down of the
party only a few others were still interested in going (Mike W., 
Steve Saeedi, and Bob Ramstaad), so if the three of you or anyone
else is still interested let me know.  I'm willing to drive, but my
car eats gas at the rate of about $.10 per mile and I'd prefer to
share the cost as maintenance on the car and others split the gas bill,
but it's negotiable.  Maybe we could rent vans, if there's more than
a small number still interested.

I think we'd have to leave after Your Sister's House on Thursday night
if we want to go.  It takes about 15 hours to get there :( but I do
believe it will be worth it.

Also, if anyone wants to come out to DJ (Jon, Lee, anyone) I'd be willing
to help with your transport costs (as I bet Pete would too, if donations
cover everything)...

So, let me know.

Dear Mr. O'Brien,

I had the good fortune of attending a few of your Come/Unity events
before the accident.  They were, without exception, some of the most
fun I've ever had on this planet.

I was greatly saddened by the news of your accident.  Something feels
strange inside when "one of your own" is hurt.

Shortly after, I ended up helping with Connection 2, an event thrown
by the SFRaves electronic mailing list.  While not originally planned
that way, it became a benefit rave for you after the accident
happened.

I was in charge of DAT taping the event and circulating cassettes.  My
plans before the event were modest, perhaps a tape tree or something
like that.  Once the true magnitude of your injury was realized, I
decided that I wanted to do something more.

Enclosed please find four tapes.  They are the complete Connection 2
rave, and I hope you enjoy them.  I decided that I would have the
tapes professionally duplicated and sell them as a benefit for you.
The DJs allowed me to release the tapes at no profit to them, with the
understanding that $5.00 from the sale of each set would go directly
to you.  Enclosed please also find a check in the amount of $750.00,
which is roughly the correct amount at this point in time.

I have been selling each set for $20.00, and had 500 sets made up at a
total approximate cost of $4,000.00.  I still have a good number of
sets to sell before I break even, but I'm ``in the ballpark'' after
selling the tapes for two months.

In any case, I will continue to sell the tapes, and as they are sold,
I will continue to send you donations.

BEST WISHES!

Well, I dunno that we've established them as being illegal.  We don't have
to be breaking the law for the cops to tell us to leave.  At most of the
sites we use there are no "area closed" signs... primarily the problem
is no-parking signs, so I guess if they really wanted to they could try
and shut us down for advocating illegal parking :)  

There's a difference between advocation and simply information which I
think makes a big difference here.  Passing info about illegal activities
is protected by the 1st amendment.  Advocating illegal activities isn't,
at least isn't explicitly protected.

Right now the owners of the machine at stanford we go through is more
concerned about voluminous drug talk than fmr's....

cop to alerty the others, he stumbled upon us a 5:30. So this area

Howdy, all... this came up last time, and it's coming up again, and so
I thought it would be most appropriate to talk about it here.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to follow through on the math:

> I have been selling each set for $20.00, and had 500 sets made up at a
> total approximate cost of $4,000.00.  I still have a good number of

500 sets * $20 each = $10,000
500 sets * $5 donation = $2,500 for Malachy
$10,000 - $2,500 - $4,000 cost = $3,500 for Bob

This math looks like it's a pretty good business deal for me.

However, I've sold roughly 150 sets so far, which puts me $1,750 in
the hole currently.  Also, I receive substantially less than $20 from
sets sold through stores, but I give a full $5 donation for each of
these.

I don't anticipate selling 500 sets at full price.  Various people on
this list who produce cassettes and CDs for sale have said that I
should have had far fewer sets made up, based on the quantity sold of
other similar items.

There ** is ** a continuing demand for the tapes, as they are
excellent (plug plug!), but the demand has been tapering off slowly.
Techno/house music listeners always ask me when the tapes were
recorded... so the tapes effectively have a "shelf life" (as it were).

The long and short is that I don't anticipate making a profit out of
this venture.  I had 500 sets made up, against the advice of
knowledgable people, because I wanted to spread the music to the
people and generate a substantial donation for Malachy.

In any case, I will continue to post financial details periodically
here to the list so everyone can see what is going on.

I had planned on going and had a couple of other interested parties.
My sister is getting married and all along I thought it was for the

'Advocating illegal activities isn't [explicitly protected speech]'

Actually, that's not right, Brian.  The First Amendment protects *speech*
(broadly interpreted to include all forms of expression).  Advocacy is
not the same as activity.  There are some limits on First Amendment
protection -- the old 'can't shout fire in a crowded theater' as well
as libel and defamation -- but if I were to write an article in the
newspaper or make a speech or put something on the Net advocating that
industries be allowed to dump toxic chemicals into drinking water --
which is illegal -- that expression is protected even if the activity
is not.

The First Amendment is essential because in addition to keeping our society
culturally open, it allows for the full expression needed to change our
laws.

Ithiel de Sola Pool wrote very insightfully on this issue in his book,
"Technologies of Freedom," which is now ten years old but deserves to
be read even more now than when it first was published.  One of the
points he makes is how expression in the *electronic* context, like here,
still does not have the full recognition it should have under First
Amendment principles.

If I were to write an article advocating the legalization of cannabis,

Subject: Together last night rocked most awesomely!


I went to 'Together' last night from midnight-2:30AM and heard some 
great music. When I arrived, Garth was spinning a delicious set which
just got better and better and better (and funkier too!). Then another
DJ came on (Neon Leon?) and played some booty-shaking bass-heavy house
music and did some K00L DJ trix while he was at it -- he has a very
dynamic and flashy  style which provided nice contrast to Garth's
reserved and calm style (translation -- he bounces up and down to the
music like a maniac, cuts in and out of songs very quickly, threw in an
effective backspin now and then, and pulses the fader between
turntables to pick up half a measure of drums from one track, and
another half-measure from another.) Definitely fun to watch.

Anyways, a good time was had by all involved. Unfortunately, I had to
leave early because my friends have regular 9-5 jobs and aren't
{self,un}employed like I am (job? -- I don't need no steenkin' job!)

Since the DJ lineup for together changes week to week, I suggest you call
979-8825 to find out. When I called last night and found out the DJ
line up, I was down there in a jiffy (and so was everybody else -- it
was quite crowded).

PS: I've been hearing alot of this new remix of "the Grid"'s "boom".
Isn't that song kind of old? (A good one, nonetheless, due to it's
subsonic space-bass). Garth played it last night, and I also heard it
played at Grove Kitchen last weekend....

Thank you to everyone who offered to pick me  up.  I just found out 
that I cannot go due to a rescheduling of a class I have to take. 
It will get out at one which is too late for the lunch. 
But thanks again, and I may need to take one of you up on your offer 
next week if anyone will still be interested.

Together, IMHO, is one of the hottest places to go during the 
week.  I haven't missed it for weeks, except for last night, when
I layed down to rest on the couch at home at 8pm.  Well, I woke up at
7:30 this morning.  I kicked myself profusely as I readied myself
for work :)

It usually is.  Did Simon spin?  He's a regular DJ there and I

Subject: First Amendment Rights (was: Pulling the Plug)

It is not illegal for you to discuss raves or to advocate illegal
acts. This is constitutionally protected free speech. A public
university may not censor your use of their facilities based upon the
content of your speech.

Since you're operating from a private university, they may be able to
shut you down based on content. I'd check with the student handbook
about free speech rights, etc. Legally, it is a contract, and if the
University says anything about honoring free speech, they're bound to
it.

[Excerpted in ACLU briefing paper #10]

Finally, in the 1969 case of _Brandenberg v. Ohio_, the Supreme Court
struck down the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan member under a criminal
syndicalism law and established a new standard: Speech may not be
suppressed or punished unless it is intended to produce "imminent lawless
action" and it is "likely to produce such action."  Otherwise, the First
Amendment protects even speech that advocates violence.  The _Brandenberg_
test is the law today.

[End of excerpt]

It has been clearly established that "imminent lawless action" means
"Right Now", with no time for reflection. No published document passes
this test, as one always has a moment for reflection between the time
one reads and time time one acts.

I'm back ;)

You guys don't need to wait for me... Connection was and always will be a
net.creation, so as long as the majority of people involved are net people
and the planning is done over email, and the focus of the party is entirely
non-profit, the Connection name may be used.

I really really do want to start planning Connection 3, but until we get a 
site all other talk is kinda superfluous.  The main obstacle being:  I want 
it to be 1) outside, 2) cheap/inexpensive, and the clincher, 3) legal.  The
past two weren't, and worked out fine anyways, but I really want to be able
to put on a good party without worrying about getting shut down or moved.
I still have a renegade heart, don't worry :)  

I do have a couple sites in mind, so when I get some time (prolly after this
weekend) I'll make some calls.  But right now my first priority is to find
a place which can deal with the 3000 people looking for a party July 2nd...

On the East Marginal Way site:  Chris has that place leased for the next
six months.  So not only will the last few raves and next few be there as
well as the next few, but most of them until the lease runs out.  For
illumination he happened to rent it out to the SF promoters that were up
here since it's so difficult to find a decent space nowadays.  I suppose it
is a good space, but the novelty of having the next place at a different

Subject: FMR/PGP

        Okay, I've finally sat down and had the time to read all the
posts about PGP and FMR and trusting people and such.  A few points:

1)  I agree with those who say that using PGP may be going a bit overboard.
I liked the phrase "Don't treat the world like a nail just coz you got a
hammer" :)  Even though I do think the police in the bay area may be somewhat
sophisticated, I doubt PGP would be worth the trouble.  I have no moral
qualms about PGP, I think it's a brilliant way to do security and will
eventually be seamless and get everyday use, but right now its complexity
would just be overwhelming.

2)  The phone tree DOES work, it's just it had a few glitches this past time
that can be fixed.  Next time I think what we should do is go all-phone
rather than rely on unpredictable email gateways.  This won't involve too
much more phone calling than before, as long as I build the tree intelligently :)
I'll also make sure it has double-redundancy as before.   As for the time to
release info, I think releasing it at 10pm with the strict rider that no one
arrives at the site until after 2am or whatever would be fine.

If you want on the phone tree, and aren't already on or haven't asked to be
on recently, send me mail.  To be on you *must* be willing to call up to
4 or 5 other people if the need arises, and you must have met me or someone
else on the tree.  I'm not going to ask 20 questions or give you a lie detector
test.  If the police are so aggro about finding out locations they could do
a lot more than "infiltrate" our "network".  Most importantly, I don't want
to deter the openness that raves, and this list itself, try and foster.

Also, if the site ends up being at a reliable location, I'll probably just 
post it to the main list.  It has yet to be proven the main list is a leak,
particulary if mail is sent that night.

3)  How does a market economy (or nature for that matter) respond to a
situation with high-demand and low-supply?  Well, whatever's being sold/
provided has its cost increased; but there's also high pressure to increase
supply.  So... maybe it's time to have a second FMR?  Or maybe a greater
number of regular outdoor renegades on other nights?  It's time, folx.
Hopefully more people will go site-hunting, find more sites, throw more
parties, etc... I fully applaude Mother Earth Sound System and wish them
the best of luck - they are a true inspiration.  I saw the seeds of this
germinating on the East Coast when I was there, too - one part of me feels
it's the next BIG wave.  I had a vision at the Full Moon Rave in DC of
dozens of these parties happening in every city, maybe three or four in the big cities, where people of all types were "clicking", just as I saw many others
out there "click"... I felt like we were the grass-roots, the foot soldiers
of the coming consciousness revolution... and then I came to, and realized
we have a lot of work to do to get there, but it's happening.  It's happening.
If all goes as planned, there will be full moons in July in New York, 
SF, and Seattle.  And possibly Boston and DC and Atlanta.... it's growing.
It's growing.  

Sorry about that, I just had a chocolate brownie so I feel inspired :)

Anyways, that's all I have to say about the furor that erupted when I was
gone.  See you all Tomorrow night at YSH!

Subject: URSS status

	
	I just sent $300 to Sound Projects to fund the R&D effort for
	the URSS.  SO far we are talking 2 18" PAS drivers in long
	tubes, maybe with doped cones to help with weather proffing and to
	also help to "get down get down get down" (we are trying for 
	reproduction as low as 30 Hz!  (The average PA system goes to 50 Hz.)
	Each bin will have two of these tubes and we'll have two bins. 
	fairly light weight and easy to carry.

	I also sent Sound Projects a copy of the C2 tapes to give them
	a better idea of what type of music we prefer to rave to out here.
	(They mostly were listening to Belgium Hardcore)

	As far as donations are concerned, I have received donations from
	the following people:

	Robert Jesse
	Randy Bias
	Eric Pederson
	Bryan Ryan
	Ben Wing

	One other person sent me a donation of $10 but I deposited the
	check before I recorded your name (you didn't have a return address
	on the envelope) Whoever you are, please speak up so you can be
	given credit for your donation.

	I think I've figured out what people get for their donation.

	1) The satisfaction that you are helping to formulate a renegade
	sound system that can be available for SFraves and other events.

	2) A special Lunch prepared by me (home cooked food) date to be
	determined.

	3) A preview draft of the Status Report/ White Paper/ Functional
	Specification of the URSS system when it is completed (handed out
	at the lunch)

	4) Free admission into the Strategic Questioning Workshop
	That I will be teaching ( My tips on dealing/talking/negotiating
	with the Authorities from a position of love and power)

	Such a deal!

	Any additional funds collected after this point will go to
	defraying the cost of further R&D, misc supplies, copying and
	to help with the final shipment cost (about $250) when the system
	is shipped from Baltimore.   Donations ($5 - $20 only please)
	can be sent to:

			URSS
			c/o Geoff White
			316 Escuela Ave. ##62
			Mountain View CA 94040

	Make checks out to me for now... I'm going to open up a bank
	account for the URSS when I get another partner who is interested
	in doing this with me.

	This part of the system will cost around $4,000, forr this much we
	get two bass bins right now with two 18" drivers each, and two 
	mid/high cabs (not sure what's in them yet) built for rugged
	handling and weatherproofed, all crossovers and active filters
	and a cabinet for the amplifiers, connectors and cables.

	I am willing to put $1500 of my own money into it but would like
	to find two or three partners who can contribute funds as well.

	I'd like to also find people who would like to purchase the amplifiers.
	We would like to start off with around 1200 Watts, 600 for the Bass
	and 300 watts each for the mid/highs (a bi-amped system) But the
	system will be designed to accomodate more power.  E -mail to me
	privately if you are interested in any of these endevors.

	I'd like a small number of partners so that we can work by
	consensus and so that the process is easy and quick, I am open
	to running it as a business so long as the main goal is to have
	fun and serve the house community.  I'd like to plow any money
	made back into the system itself to make it more rugged, have a
	maintenance fund, R&D fund, and maybe help others get systems
	built.  So far I've kept good records of where all the money
	goes. The renegade list is archived so a lot of technical process
	is being preserved.  I think the oppertunity here is to really
	explore what it takes to make relatively cheap, lightweight,
	house music oriented, portable sound.

        Oh, it's so good to be home ;) 

Friday night: Foundation looks like the best shot, but as was noted last
week, previous successes do not guarantee future success.  Well, with that
DJ lineup it's worth a try.  I myself am hitching a ride to Pete's shindig
in Utah :)

Saturday night:  Wicked is usually a guaranteed deal, the music just can
not be beat.  And since it's at the Stone is *may* be 18+, but don't hold
me to it.  If you want something different, True Devotion may be worth the
long drive it's likely to take (the last "Devotion" was out in Stockton!)
as many people had fun at the last one, and a location outside of the
city would be really nice for a change ;)

Sundays: the ambient party looks good.  And I presume the afternoon on the
beach things are still happening.  Anyone know?

Subject: Knolls
To: solstice@slack.sim.es.com

I went out to Knolls, the first desert location, last night.  It is *perfect*.
There is really NOTHING there, but a large outcropping of rock, some sand
dunes, and small plants.  There is a spot about a mile in off of I-80, with a
large area of hard ground and a picnic table.  What was really frightening was
the fact that a storm was rolling in.  Things can get really hairy out there
when that happens, so pray for good weather.  Things were also a bit chilly, so
don't assume that it will be 80 degrees at night.  When I was driving back
after the sun had set, it was so inky black over the desert it felt like I was
staring into a void.  With a new moon, the sky will probably swallow us up out
there.

I'm trying to have an alternative indoor location, just in case things get
nasty.  Finding that for free is difficult though.

To: solstice@slack.sim.es.com, sfraves@sfraves.stanford.edu (SF Raves),
        socal-raves@ucsd.edu (So Cal Raves)

These are the absolute and final details for Solstice, presented by Taste in
Utah. 

June 18th - Friday
Location: Mountain peak near Salt Lake City
Time: Sunset (about 9:45 now) to sunrise  (6ish)
There may or may not be a map point for this one.  I'm not sure of the
necessity and a lot of people know the location already.  The thing that
counts is that it is near, but outside of Salt Lake County.  If anyone tries
to shut us down maliciously, they'll be calling the wrong policemen.  I went
and mountain biked around this location last Sunday, and it was perfect sunny
weather, but a bit chilly.  Bring a sweater!

June 19th - Saturday
Location: Knolls recreation area.  Exit 41 off of I-80.  About 80 miles west
of Salt Lake City.
Time: Sunset to ????
We were originally going to do this the first night, but decided on the second
night, so we can take it into Sunday if we want.  You can camp, shoot off
fireworks, run around naked, or drop bombs on the complementary Airforce
bombing range six miles down (we should have great bass).  You can pretty much
get away with doing anything you want here, because it is BLM land and nobody
cares.  Just clean up after yourself.

Cost: Our absolute cost on this is about $220.  We have a good, but not
extremely powerful sound system and a capable generator.  Gas and time have
not been included.  We are requesting donations, but not demanding them.  If
you want to see more of this activity, show your appreciation and donate.
Otherwise it is back to the warehouses and possible shutdowns one hour after
you pay your $10.  If you want to sell cookies, t-shirts, drinks, or whatever,
feel free, but donate generously.

DJ's:  Right now, it is still just me.  A guy told me he was going to fly in
several DJs, but after meeting him, I believe he is planning to use a UFO for
this purpose.  Anyone, anyone can DJ who wants to.  The only thing I ask is
that people can dance or listen to it.  In other words, calypso could be cool,
but Anthrax may cause some problems.

For up to date information regarding both nights, call the Taste hotline at
801-461-3375.   The whole weekend is weather dependent and right now, there
aren't any indoor alternatives.  So call the hotline before going anywhere.

Please please POST to SFRAVES the info on the loc of this event since 
there's lots of us that wanna go.

FYI, El Rio is on Mission St, near Army. This would be the ideal
location because it's too fffin hot; Dancing outside at El Rio will
feel very Caribbean.

The downside is that this kinda weather is
gangstas-staying-out-on-the-streets-trying-to-riot weather. So watch
yer back, recharge yer love phasers, do up that blunt and kick back and
be cool.

Subject: Samplers...

To all TechnoRavers,

Here's a suggestion for anyone who knows a little or knows someone with
electronics experience.  You can buy, from Active Electronic Centre
(1-800-665-5488 in Vancouver) a digital sampler for $74.34 (don't know the
type of sample -- 8 or 16 bit -- or the frequency that it samples at).  I
have asked the company to give me the specs on the board though, so I'll
have it posted in a few days.  The reason you need electronics experience
is that it is a IC on a printed board with a completed sampling circut. 
All it needs (that I can tell from the picture) is a microphone, an output
jack, a switch to play the sample and a 9VDC power source...

If anyone wants the number for the Seattle company, write me.

Subject: YSH 3

It was held next to the Bay at 24th St. just east of 3rd.  A small plot
of 'beach' (actually sort of ground up gravel and cement and scrub with
a big pile of cement boulders forming a 'baywall'.  Across the little
inlet was Dead Muni Bus Land where I gather previous events have occurred.

Pretty good scene, I'd say the dominant tone was 'relaxed.'  The highlight
for me was an especially good set from Shobhan.  If I were 'you' I might
strongly consider 'Diverse City' on June 25 with Jon Williams, Goa
Gil, Shobhan, La Paix and Dean Evans -- diverse lineup indeed!  It's
way past time some of the women DJs got on more 'mainstream' bills
like this -- as Ruth Ginsburg said this week, it's time to get beyond
tokenism in that regard.

Saw the Normals, Vitamin B, Sin, Derek, rmt, geoffw and tam . . . nice
turnout from the sfraves posse and I'm sure there were more I didn't
catch!  And I got to meet crunch hisownbadself :)

When the generator died the second time for lack of gas, I decided
it was time to hit it.

That generator sound is so familiar because for years I've participated
in ham radio's Field Day (the next one is next weekend), where you go
out to some site in a field somewhere (we go on top of Kelly Butte in
Portland with the magnificent view of Mt. Hood), set up temporary
antennas and radio stations, get an old clunker generator or two,
get on the air, make a bunch of contacts, drink lots of beer, get
eaten by millions of mosquitoes, nearly avoid the poison ivy, and
got doused in thunderstorms.

Sort of like a ham radio rave :)

Hi all!!

After a weekend of going to parties full of expectations (which is
never a good sign ... ), YSH was a perfectly administered dose of
freshness and happy thoughts.   Ahhhh, yes. :)

The first DJ from Chicago played some incredible music that invoked
a real feeling of history.  Know what I mean?  There were some Indian
classical music sounds, as well as this one tune that included piano,
a lovely female vocal in Arabic (I think), scratching, and a house beat.
While dancing, I felt as if I were doing the dance of the Ancients.

Even the generator dying was ok with me.  It gave a chance to talk
to people that I see everywhere, but have never met.   Connecting with
people is the key.

Anyways, don't have much more to say.  Great to see Lee, Bob, AstroBoy,
Brian, *, and the whole happy crew.  

The morning ended on a very special note for me as well.  At one point,
maybe around 4am, the dj dropped out the music and put on a traditional
Indian prayer and everyone had their arms in the air.  Well, it turns
out that that prayer was one that my mother used to sing to me all through
my childhood when I was lying in bed but scared to go to sleep.

Hearing it played last night was so, so, *so* intense.  
Ahh, to experience life.

Right on, Sisters!!
Ravi

Nice to meet some of you yesterday at the lunch and last night at YSH.
I left after the generator broke the first time, but the music up until
then had been inspiring. First party i've been to this year that 
deserves a kool (pronounce cool-with-a-k) rating.

See yall around

Hi all!  Here's the latest version of the phone list.  Thanks go out
to Geoff and Jessica who helped filter out some of the obsolete numbers.

Also, I've separated out the general info lines on top; if anyone knows
any info lines for other parts of the country/world, I'd like to add them,

Subject: Our sister list needs HELP.

- I don't know how many people on sfraves also have been receiving ne-raves,
but those of you who have must have realized by now that they are having
a serious problem, namely the ne-raves list has been turned off.
I think what is needed is a new site for neraves, one that can handle
the traffic (about 2/3 that of sfraves.) They may also need a new list
admin. but that is something best decided among the inner core of ne-ravers,
... anyway, I'm sure most of you know who they are.If anyone has any ideas for them, I'm sure they'd appreciate it.
The list as I said before is non-operational, so perhaps it might be best
to propose solutions to the individual members,perhaps on vrave which is
still (THANK YOU BRIAN AND CMK!) operating.

Subject: Re: Our sister list needs HELP.

Thanks Chris!

I found out today WHY ne-raves is non-operational.

Basically, due to negligence on the part of our list administrator, John
Adams.

Joe Turner found out that when the owners of the machine the ne-raves list
lives on moved all their "guest" lists to a new machine, they left ne-raves
disabled on purpose because the list administrator had not been handling
things like bounces and bad addresses on the list, even after many days
of the same addresses bouncing.  Joe also says that John has been 
unreachable lately by email AND by phone.

We need help, but don't give it to us yet.  I think ne-raves really needs
this shake-up so it will grow up a bit.  We need to solve this problem
ourselves, or else the commitmment and cooperation needed to keep it going
forevermore will never truly be formed.

But if you have any suggestions, anyone, please forward them to the following
addresses:

	John Adams (current list admin) -- jna@bronze.lcs.mit.edu
	Joe Turner (a concerned list member) -- cutter@bronze.lcs.mit.edu
	Laura La Gassa (ne-raves big sister) -- laura@usl.com

Thanks very much.

Love and community,

Laura

KNOW THYSELF   THE FOUNDATION STARTS WITHIN

This was at 8th and Gilman in Berkeley.  Not too crowded, but a decent sized
posse for the place, good attitude, fine spinning, some interesting visuals.
Garth finished out with a typically funky set.  I asked whether he was
coming to Portland and he said he's never been invited . . . so I think
I have some work to do when I get home :)

I've been recovering from the effects of a cold earlier this week, and
actually had a little bit of a fever earlier in the evening, but I rallied
strong and had a good time overall.  Just wish people would not smoke
cigarettes on the floor (which means they take a drag every so often and
let us inhale the rest -- yech, especially at 128 bpm).

Also, having a map point in the City for an event in the East Bay seems
a bit weird, especially for a standard joint like Gilman.  If I'd known
I would have taken the last BART, as it was I took the bus to the end
of the F line (onna night owl tip) in El Cerrito and walked about a mile
to Gilman.

Anyway, it was fun, I didn't see anyone I know, guess you're all getting
rested up for the rest of the weekend :)

The 415 number still has the old message.  The 408 and 916 numbers
give directions to the map point at the ORchard Truck Stop on Hwy 132
going toward Modesto.  Says the event is at a 500-acre ranch 'surrounded
by barbed wire and a river'.  Sheesh.

Office joke...Hmmm. Given the history of the SF FBI Office, if they know
about your scene, they are probably "studying" it. The SF FBI Office was
involved in the murders of Oakland Panthers, the contrived arrest and
subsequent imprisonment of Leonard Peltier, the timber industry bombing
of Judi Bari, etc.    They will become more interested if they perceive
you folks as a growing drug subculture, or if the scene becomes politically
active... As an Easterner, the sfraves list appears to stay clear of both.
 
>ever hear of the freedom of information act? i suppose it isn't
>perfect...but it could be a useful tactic...and information source...(:(:

Don't count on it. Even if you made a FOIA demand, you wouldn't get anything
useful (they would disclose nothing informative) other than to find out if
they know that you exist. As a matter of fact, an FOIA demand may open
their eyes to your existence.

>just a few thoughts...partyon...susie (:

If you think that the FBI may have assigned agents to the SF rave scene,
read THE COINTELPRO PAPERS by Ward Churchill (Director of the Colorado
American Indian Movement (AIM) and a professor at CU Boulder); this is a
definitive analysis of the FBI's proactive efforts to destroy alternative
social movements, and includes copies of FOIA-released FBI documents (and
shows you how poor the FOIA laws are in the US). Judi Bari of the Ecotopia
Earth First! group has a massive amount of material available on the
SF FBI Office's [often illegal] activity; she has published a book called
"Timber Wars" that includes accounts of the SF FBI's involvement in the
bombing of her car and the destruction of evidence ($12 c/o Judi Bari, 
106 W. Standley, Ukiah, CA 95482....707/468.1660). Both of these books 
should be standard reading for anyone interested in social justice.

Ultimately, there is probably no need to worry unless/until strange things
start to happen, such as totally unexpected busts, the advent of internal
strife within the group, or you folks suddenly condense into a tangible
social movement with political objectives...

In the meantime, dance to the music, and educate yourselves on the 
possibilities. Music is life, music is freedom.

Hey youse.

This is kind of in reply to Jacob's msg. about the Harthouse comp,
and to inform people. Yes, a Harthouse comp has come out in America.
But it is _not_ the same as the double LP Harhouse: Point of No Return Chpt. 1.
It is a six-song ep, with none of the same tracks (excepting if you want
that it has Acceperiance III while PoNR has Acceperiance I).

It's out on Moonshine Music, which is a Cali label that puts out compilations
which mix great songs (like Funky Guitar) with absoulte shite (like Speed
Racer). and includes stupid inserts which say, "you like the music, now
buy the look... get our rave gear catalog...." etc. etyecch.

i havent bought it yet (even tho i have a record store discount) but im
sure its good.
ill post more when i do get it.

$20 is standard for "five-phone-number" parties - the number of phone
numbers better correlates with price than number of tents :)

Sharons, Cool Worlds, Funky Tekno Tribes, etc. are all usually $20.

Let Freedom Rave, Cyberfest, Unity, and Universe will probably all be
at least $20.

Subject: Devotion

Well, yes, it was a 90 mile trip out there to the region around Modesto.  Abd,
yes, it was 20 bucks to get in.  And there was also beer.

It was awesome anyway.

We got out there to the map/pay point, and the excitement of last year's
Devotion was back.  The moon was down and the Milky Way totally visible
to the naked eye.  The view was incredible, especially looking at the river
or whatever it was out there in the morning.  The sound system was pretty good,
with Harry Who and John Williams going off, and Shon destroying the world
with some really heavy hip house/tribal.  Man o man he was incredible!

The crowd was largely high school.  This does not bother me at all, because 
these kids knew how to party!  Very social and open, lots of great vibe
floating around, cheering at the music.  Much better than almost any
21+ club I have been to.  I wish I knew about this stuff when I was in 
high school!

Drove off at 6 am to make it to Davis for graduation at 8, made it by 10 minutes
all dirty in my clothes.  Nothing a cap and gown can't hide!


Out door raves are the greatest.  By having the space so far away, there was
virtually no possibility of it being busted.  Incredible.

That is funny. Maybe we should look at a collection of raves and see
if we can come up with an informal "ruleset" for accurately predicting
the price.  Sort of like one of those Cosmo "Rate Your Sex Life"
quizzes:

1. For each phone number on the flier, add 10 points.
2. Add 2 points for each DJ listed.
3. If the flier is printed on real photographic paper, add 5 points.
etc..

Could be fun to hand out to newbies. :) :)

You could always take advantage of th "SFR posse bus line". I work

Subject: LA To-Gather July 10

last nite i went to a "promoters" meeting for the people
who are organizing the benefit in LA for malachy

(although i dont know why they call them promoters meetings
or if that is just the term we were using cuz its not about
promoters as brian has pointed out for the ones in sf)

heres the basic deal-a party will happen, half the profit
goes to the malachy trust fund, a quarter goes to rebuild LA
and the other quarter goes to covenant house

its is going to be styled after teh july 10th thing
and is going to be a healing ceremony more for LA
than it will be for malachy if all goes well

the meeting was very much geared towards spirituality and a postive
way about going through life and looked real good
i was really being amazed by people i thought were shmucks

one thing that seemed to be a problem for people was that they were helping
some guy that no one has ever heard of
they would really liek to change this, but they really dont know
him as well as people around here do, soo....

what i would like is to get the following stuff:

people's personal feeling about malachy

his background in the community and possibly elsewhere

what exaclty has happened since the accident
 (both in the scene and with his recovery)

what is the exact details on his trust fund and all that

anything else you can think of

apparently they have been taking pictures at all the meetings
and sending them up to him with notes of what is going on
also one thing that would be nice is if he can get down
here for the event, and to do that we need a wheelchair van

SO IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE TO GET A WHEELCHAIR VAN for JULY 9-11th
or something like that PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know
it would really make everything much better

i couldnt remember if there was anything else i had in mind
but im sure you can just send whatever you can 
and it will be cool

driving hundreds of miles alone to get out there, not to mention getting
back, tired and all...so I succumbed to her greateer wisdom...but I want to
make the next one, and have a car, just need to get a few folks together
to make the road trip (if there is one, that is...).  anyone else out there

following: 

Xochipilli - 6/25 - definitely outside

 Hawaii was great and tiring at the same time. Since I was chaffeuring my
Dad around the islands and meeting friends and relations left and right, I 
didn't get a chance to do a proper investigation of raves in Hawaii. I did
find a new monthly tabloid called DEEP , that focuses on youth culture , 
especially music and lifestyle. 

 There was a club called the Garage in Honolulu that was advertised in DEEP.
The group LA Style will be playing there soon. There's another spot that's
"all ages" called Zone 42 (? or was it Zone 24 ?) , and also the Pink 
Cadillac. All these clubs are located well away from the wretched Waikiki
nightclub area.

 I'll post a mini-review of the Garage ( and my other impressions of the 
hawaiian rave scene ) later ...

Subject: Weekend Update 6-20-93

I mixed a business trip with some extra-extensive extracurriculars
this past weekend . . . starting at Your Sister's House and
Foundation, which I mentioned in previous posts.  Saturday evening I
wasn't feeling so great, but decided to give Wicked at the Stone a
try, despite my lingering congestion and, well, the Stone.
 
Met Lee Fogel and some of his friends outside while we waited for the
crew to haul out the remnants of the heavy metal show.  The last time
I was at the Stone was last fall for Southside Johnny and the Asbury
Jukes.  The band was great, the crowd was boring and the staff was
obnoxious, so I wasn't real optimistic.
 
On the other hand, this was wicked@stone, so things figured to work
out after a while -- and they did.  We got in around 2 to find the
order a little different than advertised.  Jeno was already up and
running a smooth set which actually peaked fairly early and then set
the stage nicely for things to come.  Then came Markie, Master of the
Edge with a solid set that suddenly veered into a tremendous long
Cloud Nine acid jam -- best spinning I've heard from him and the
standout of the weekend.  Garth finished up for the second night in a
row, after a yeoman job cheering Markie on, with another enthusiastic
turn.  It was quite a sight to see Carlos on the floor intensely urging
him on -- he would've raised Garth off the DJ platform if he could've :)
it was one of those moments that makes it so wonderful to be in
this scene.
 
This was my first event north of Market and I could tell the diff in
the ambience from the good ole SOMA spaces.  The Stone is certainly
not the ideal place for this kind of party, but it worked well enough,
and there was even a bit of that ole magic especially during Markie's
set.  They even had free ice water available, and the staff basically
stayed out of the way.
 
Anyway, I had rallied strongly after feeling a little off earlier, and
ended up on the floor nearly continuously for 5+ hours.  And then felt
good enough to head over 1015 Folsom, which turned out to be another
good call.  I hadn't been to Boogie Buffet before, but it is shaping
up as a very nice event.  A good hard trancey sound in the front room,
with people mostly hanging out, and after a while they opened up the
far end -- what a nice space!  I hadn't seen Folsom since the last Come/Unity
there -- overheard someone saying they have two fulltime carpenters working
on the place.  Flowers in big vases, some sculptures, beanbag chairs and
a soda/coffee/French toast bar, and a DJ playing some jazzy jazz.  A
nice decompression chamber after a rockin' weekend!
 
After getting some sleep I wandered over to the Haight St. Fair around
2 pm, stopping first on Lower Haight to check out the scene.  Some
people living in the 600 block were out on the sidewalk with a table
selling cookies and brownies and things, while dancing around to the
Lee side of the Connection II tapes!  So I hung around for a bit and
had a nice chat'n'skip with them . . . It seems like the C II tapes
are everywhere -- I've heard 'em all over the place in the last month.
 
On trudging up the hill, the Fair was going full blast.  I stopped at
Housewares and picked up Twitch CD 6 and a really cool UK tape,
'Kitchen Synch' with Jon Williams and Phil Smart, very nice stuff.  It
turned out the DJ in front was none other than Buck, who I hadn't
heard or met yet -- it was good to chat with him, and I gather he's coming
through the Northwest soon and maybe going back to the UK this summer.
Further up Haight I came across Mark and the Ameba crew.  Word is he's
got new partners and things are looking up, which I'm very happy to
report.  I also ran across M and P-ter who gave the lowdown, as it was
at that moment, on Xochipilli.
 
 
And I decided that if I could have such a great time despite not
hitting any 'killer' events this past weekend, it was time to plunge
back in so I'll be back for Xochipilli and whatever else transpires
this weekend!

	Well, this'll be my first weekend back in SF in over 5 weeks so I
intend to make the most of it ;)

	The big news is that the Universe rave on July 31st has been 
postponed till September 18th.... So see if you can get those airline
ticket reservations changed... 


	Friday - Xochipili gets my vote, because it's outdoors and the 
lineup is great and I am helping with setup :)  I can't predict how Diverse
City is going to be but John Williams is now one of my favorite DJ's, so
it could be worth it for him alone...

	Saturday - Any of those three sound great, they are all being put
on by reliable companies.  I'll probably end up at Earth Beat because it's
been far too long since I've heard Garth, but OAP will be good if it
delivers what it promises... and "Hyperspace" will most likely be laid
back but musically top-notch as well.

	And I'll be damned if I don't find a beach party or SOMETHING on
Sunday :)  Maybe make an attempt at Glug Glug again.....

	Hope to see you all out!  Remember to post reviews of those parties
you go to, so we can hear how they are...

 Sorry for the test posting, but I haven't received any SFRaves stuff since

No! Tell me it isn't true! I love that guy. I've been to about 10
events and he's my favorite. He really knows how to get the crowd (and
me) moving. I'd really hate to see him go. (sniff)

If Penelope's Web (July 31 - August 1) delivers half of what it is
attempting to deliver, this will be a 100% family -- our tribe --
event which will be a great time for all.  3 hours north of SF on
private land (no busts), camping, communal meals... day care for the
kids...

so you might not want to cash in those airplane tickets :-)

 Well, since I'm still waiting for the regular SFRaves mail to get re-connected
to me , I was wondering if there's any concensus as to what events people
are going to this weekend? I managed to FTP the 6/17/93 version of the 
calender , which listed the following events -

 FRI: 	Xochipilli
	Diverse City
	Romper Room


 SAT: 	Earth Beat
	One Almighty Party
	

 Also - what's the opinion on July's CYBERFEST ? Huge damn flyer! The event
may be much too mega for me.

Ya, the flyer I have for this thing is a 2 page glossy that looks like a 
magazine cover.  The cool thing is that it has useful information though.
It has a map of how to get there, a map of the grounds, including where every
tent, etc. is, the price is listed (for advance purchases anyway), and of
course what djs are at what area as well as all the hype (pyschedelic-virtual
reality petting zoos n' shit ;-).

On monday i'm leaving for Tennesee to visit a commune some friends of mine
grew up on, as well as doing some other hippy gathering stuff :) (repeat
over and over: "I'm not turning into a hippy, it's just raving with
different music...":):):)  Anyway, Saturday night we're having a going
away party at our house with the Mother Earth Sound System dj's (since
it's indoors, it's not really a MESS event).  Also in B-Town on Saturday
afternoon in People's Park CAN (Cannabis Action Network) are doing a hemp
rally/smoke in with music and such.  We live a block south of the park @
2545 Hillegass (Le Chateau co-op), so smoke a fatty and come swim in our
pool, then party down until 2am with us.  This party may or may not cost a
buck, depending on whether or not you want to give us one :) Should be a
rather laid back affair, but if a billion sfravers show up...  By the way,
you didn't read this on the net, so don't tell anyone at my house that you

Hope to see some of you tomorrow, or until I get back from hippy-land,

Subject: Xochipilli Will Not Be Stopped!


 Despite unsympathetic authorities and mindless machinery , Xochipilli
prevailed! Kudos to M Normal and others for pulling it off. 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 I arrived at the original site at about 1AM , to find out that it had to
be moved to Candlestick ! The officers of the law had moved in quite soon
after the site setup was begun , and shut it down. 

 So , off to Candlestick I went ( Big Hint: NEVER take HW84 to get back to
the Bay from the coast , use HW 92 ! ). A number of cars were already 
there by the time I got to the Candlestick's park.

 By 3:30AM , the music was going , and it seemed that Xochipilli was GO !
But the park's groundkeepers had one last surprise for us - the
timer controlled lawn sprinklers ! Showered dancers flee! But even this 
problem was surmounted , and the dancers returned .  
 
 DJ Dani (?) was followed by a live performance by Dub Tribe . After a
danceable set ( albeit plauged by sound system glitches ) , Dub Tribe was
followed by DJ Moonpup. 

 I left during Moonpup's sunrise set , so other's will have to provide
the details for after 6:45AM.

 Some personal highpoints:

* Some places in the dance area were stereo "sweet spots" where a head 
  movent of a distance of one foot resulted in neat stereo location effects.

* Bocci Bob's dog is definitely rave-trained! Playful without being
  obnoxious.

* Neat little beach within decent hearing distance of the sound system.
  Very nice to dance on , and the asphalted paths were good dance areas
  too.

* Cooperative weather - not a hint of fog . Starry skies , and not very windy
  at all.

Yes, after hauling 8 speaker cabinets, a heavy amp box, my turntables,
and other assorted heavy equipment down a steep long path with a vertical
drop of maybe 500 feet, not *10* minutes after the cops show up and ask
M to call it quits or everyone could pay a $33 citation for being there.
Oh well, perhaps there is time for bargaining and dealing and other times
when it's not appropriate.  I think what gave us away was we started
relatively early for a renegade (people were there ~midnight) and cars up
in the parking lot had their lights on, etc.  If we had arrived to set up
at 2, *maybe* it would have gone smoother, but at this point it's an 
imponderable.  I think there is a lot to be said for the critical mass
factor - it's easy for them to threaten to cite 30 people, while they
prolly wouldn't bother citing 300.

> So , off to Candlestick I went ( Big Hint: NEVER take HW84 to get back to

Heh... yes, a total of a 2 1/2 hour drive for something 10 minutes away.
I was the first car to arrive at the new site, and particularly freaked 
that the stadium lights were on full blast, meaning we wouldn't have the
cover of night.  Not to mention several random cars driving back and forth 
in a supposedly deserted area... very freaky, but the cops never showed.

> By 3:30AM , the music was going , and it seemed that Xochipilli was GO !

MOre like 4:15 - soon after the music started a faint reddish glow appeared
over the north-east horizon.  The sun was rising already!

>But the park's groundkeepers had one last surprise for us - the
>timer controlled lawn sprinklers ! Showered dancers flee! But even this 
>problem was surmounted , and the dancers returned .  
 
As soon as it popped up, someone yelled "STEP ON IT", i.e., put your foot
on the shower head to prevent the water from hitting the speakers or amps or
anything.  This was REALLY funny, and I learned a couple cool ways to dance
with one foot stationary for 20 minutes.  It also made the dance floor in 
places nice and mushy, so I took my shoes off and enjoyed the feel of God's
Carpeting.

> DJ Dani (?) was followed by a live performance by Dub Tribe . After a

It was our very own Lee before that, who played a wonderful set.  Dub Tribe
were *extremely* good - it comprised of a guy playing three congos, another
guy manipulating a R-8, an Alesis MMT-8, and Emax-2, a Juno 106, and a couple
other various processors and filters, and a female singer dropping in diva-
esque vocals buried into the mix.  It was *fantastic*, live music at parties
has never worked for me until tonight.  The Moonpup came on and played a nice
hi-energy set....

> I left during Moonpup's sunrise set , so other's will have to provide
>the details for after 6:45AM.

Not much, it ended at 7:15 coz the sound guys were getting tired (and the 
timing seemed right).  Around 6:45 Susan came on and played for 30 minutes,
and boy did she make an impression!  Really really nice tweak-house including
the best closing song I've heard in a *long* time (hopefully someone knows 
what it was).  Anyways, the site was made "cleaner than we found it", the
equipment loaded, and right as the last speaker cabinet was loaded the rangers
"opened" the park.  I don't know if anyone exchanged any words.. did they?

>* Some places in the dance area were stereo "sweet spots" where a head

Hahaha... also, as with most outdoor parties, I noticed the sound got more and
more interesting the farther away you went - I walked out to a peninsula as
the sun was rising, about 1/2 mile away, and it was still pretty loud.  The
sound system was big and bulky, but *NICE*.

>* Bocci Bob's dog is definitely rave-trained! Playful without being

I've never seen a dog so damn happy.  And dancing in time to the beat!  
How'dja do it, Bob?

>* Cooperative weather - not a hint of fog . Starry skies , and not very windy
>  at all.

Hee - "Where's the sprinkles?  We're throwing an outdoor party, it's GOTTA
start threatening rain!"  :)

Kudos to M and P-ter for a party which, despite the trials and tribulations,
prooved to be a wonderful time for all.  If you need any more help in making
back the money you spent or owe please let us know....

*Phew*.  I thought you actually liked that stuff ;)  I know you only bought
it coz it reminds you of your mom's old Hoover vacuum, right?  

I was kinda disappointed that no one stayed past 5am, which is probably my 
favorite part of outdoor events, when the sun is just about to rise and you
can see who you've been dancing with all night.

The Denon 2000 is *very*nice*.  I'm seriously considering, if possible, trading
my two turntables for it.  I'm not a competant DJ by any means, I usually
bat, say, .250 when trying to beat-match two slabs of vinyl, but after half
an hour with the Denon I was getting 3 out of every 4 mixes down solid.  I
want i want i want....

I really admire Pete for choosing another site.  It would have been really easy
to say, well, this IS public use land, you didn't exactly pay to reserve it, so
it's your tough luck... but doing this helped show we're not in this to make
enemies out of strangers...

The trains were a really cool part about the site.  You could see them as
they approached a mile or two away, and at one point two went by at the same 
time in different directions.  One was an Amtrak train, and I wonder what 
the passengers thought when they looked out their window and saw a group
of huddled ravers pass by....

Pete played the most glorious, perfect set when the sun rose.  Very dubby,
very trippy, all in the 100-120 bpm range, songs like "Sun Rising" by the
Beloved, "Higher than the Orb" by Primal Scream, Psychic Warriors ov Gaia,
other nice dubby stuff.  He then ended it with this wacked-out big band
really bizarre song that had everyone dancing with incredulous looks on their
faces, with a sampled ending from a Seseme Street record.  Amazing, Pete,
really well done.

Agreed.  As the sun was setting Saturday night on the way out, I found out
Joni MItchell *was* right, the sunsets in the desert really are "purple and
red and yellow and on fire..." it was gorgeous.  And because it was a new
moon the stars were out in force, and you could literally tell yourself, 
"i'm not looking away until I see a shooting star" and it would come within
minutes.  I had *never* seen the Milky Way so prominant either....  And the
sunrise was equally stunning.

Yeah... agreed, definitely.  I'm pretty sure I'll be flying out for your
next one, rather than getting another $107 speeding ticket for doing 83 on
the 65-mph interstate 80.  *sigh*

After the party ended and everyone went home, we stuck around because Eric
and Rich needed some sleep.  I climbed to the top of one of the local knolls,
with a 360-degree-view, and meditated for about an hour.  The view was
breathtaking, the scenery brown, the sky the deepest blue... it was really
good.  Made me definitely decide to go to the Pyramid lake thing on the 17th 
of July... the desert is where it's at!  

Many kudos to Pete for a job well done.  I got a real impression of what
you are doing in Salt Lake - you're not necessarily trying to advance the
state of human consciousness through raves, you're not trying to propagate
any sort of love-the-world feeling; you're simply serving to facilitate 
people having a good time listening to good music.  And it's obvious the
other SLC ravers I talked to loved Pete, from the 27-year-old couple who
were appointed "rave mommy and daddy" to the 17-year-old girl who had been
given WAY too much MDMA to everyone else who is there.  They are there for 
the music, Pete's making sure of that ;)  It seems almost a paternal thing
for Pete and John, and I really really like that.

See you at your next party, Pete!

Subject: Re:  Xochipilli Will Not Be Stopped!

First party I've ever been to where the rain come UP instead of down!

I rode down with Brian to the site after picking up his turntables at
Cin's (they don't call that box a coffin for nothing! ).  We hustled
all the equipment down to the beach at Greyhound Rock, a chore enough,
but I figured we'd have many hours before tackling the more difficult
job of getting it all back up.  (When the megabeachrave of the future
happens, we'll have a helicopter to drop in ready-made sound systems ;).

I mean, this was the perfect spot, the moon just setting on the northwest
horizon, the waves crashing, a reasonably flat and hard-packed beach.
Someone had set up large candles or lanterns in an arc running along  the
beach -- way cool effect.

Anyway, no sooner had we got the second speaker stack assembled than the
word came down from above -- M and P-ter went to update the phone
message but  met the county mounties on the way back with the bad news.
Very big shame.  A very big effort to get everything back up the hill.

When we first arrived at Candlestick I was pessimistic.  No access from
the road and the stadium lights were on.  Strike two.  However, checking
it over, it seemed like it might work anyway.  The caravaners from 
Greyhound and assorted others gathered and it was decided to go ahead.
This time nearly everyone pitched in to move in the system and it was
set up in relatively quick order.  

After that-- save for the sprinklers -- everything worked out great.
Lee, Moonpup and Susan gave us quite different mixing styles, and 
even a confirmed skeptic like me (having watched and reviewed bands
for a real long time) had to say that Dub Tribe is a pretty good outfit
and they *even* live up to the name -- it's obvious they truly
understand the classic dub sound, so here it is, we have real live
dubhouse techno, a combination I've fervently hoped for and haven't
had much hope of seeing.  Between this and what I hear groups like
the Broun Fellinis are doing, it looks like things are opening up for
a combination of live and DJ events (there may even be a collaborative
effort by Moonpup and Dub Tribe one of these days) which would return
us back to the original Madchester formula that worked so well five
years ago.

As the sun rose, and despite all the hassles, I had to admit we had
pretty much the perfect trance/ambient/chill/hiphop (!) space going,
with the clarity of a brilliant sunrise, the clear morning air of the
Bay, and even Candlestick Park nestled in a context of trees and
plants instead of the grungy parking lot (which we couldn't directly
see).  Not the overwhelmingly overthetop ravetime the beach event
provided, but  something else graceful and fun instead.  That's what
I like about this scene -- even when you're disappointed there are
always alternatives and they nearly always come from the ingenuity
and sticktoitiveness of the participants.

Finally, major props to M Normal for doing it.  I think her insistence
that the energy and effort needs to move outside is part of taking tiger
mountain (by strategy) . . .

Our space at the Jack Rabbit area of the park was posted for a Westinghouse
Electric event during  the day.  We briefly considered the possibility of
just keeping going and offering a little ambience for their gig . . . 
maybe another time for that . . .!

Greyhounds and Jack Rabbits . . . what a night . . .

Subject: Early event info for 6/26

One Almighty Party has been cancelled.  They are doing another event
on August 7 with Ernie Munson and Markie Mark ("on 4 turntables"),
Buck, Spun, Tony and Noel

Earth Beat is at 99 Hegenberger Road in Oakland, near the airport --
take 880 to Hegenberger, go west.  The message says doors open at 10
I'm not exactly sure what kind of place this is but I know a fair
bit about the area (since it's near both the airport and the Coliseum)
and it might be fairly roomy.  They also say on the message they have
all permits (hmm).

Elmo's has a long DJ list including Rich, Shobhan, Steve Mitchell,
Moonpup, Carlos, Darwin, Vinnie, Neon Leon and Galen.  Since Neon Leon
is very busy doing pre-parade stuff, I'd assume this has to be south
of Market somewhere but no info on the phone message yet.  They are
also offering "free body painting, massages, breakfast and afterparty" :)

Tilt-a-Whirl line is busy, but I presume they're at the Bkly Aquatic Park.
I could be persuaded to go to that one, I like that site a lot.

A good guess tonight about the place 2 B . . . let it be a challenge
to U!!

The long (and the new message that was just posted is VERY long) and the
short of it is that Hyperspace tonight is cancelled and the DJs (Dag,
Demigod, others) will be combined into the regular Tilt-a-Whirl at
Thunder Bay (the old funhouse next to the Berkeley Aquatic Park)
tomorrow night.  Guess they'll be running at  the same time as Glug Glub
for a totally watery Sunday eve :)

So that leaves us with Earth Beat and Elmo's  . . . and whatever else

Subject: re: Xochipilli Will Not Be Stopped!


just a few random comments to add to the fray...

one thing that was cool is that some of the people arriving at
greyhound rock, only to discover it was busted, actually got out of
their cars and made a trip down to the beach to help carry some of the
gear up.  without this help, there's no way the gear could have gotten
out of there, as most of the early crowd was pretty fagged out from
carrying all the stuff down -- and up was a real nightmare, easily
three or four times as hard as down.  so the latecomers who lent a
hand really made the thing work, as the sound guys probably would have
been a lot less psyched to move to Candlestick if either a) they had
to move the stuff back up themselves or b) if it had taken more than
an hour to load out.

an award for quick thinking under pressure goes to Larry Ching, who
came up with the "method" used for handling the sprinklers...
inspired!

all the DJs kicked ass, frankly.  it was really good to hear susan
again, she played first at YSH this week, and this set was really
nice, tho short.  Moonpup probably cycled through 30 records in 55
minutes at least (!), and as usual, blew me away with his technical
prowess.  Lee had a lot of great stuff and really established the
party right, excellent!

Dubtribe: gotta see a full performance from these guys.  Great
concept, great execution, just great!  Can't wait to hear them with a
live DJ, which is what they are practicing towards (with Jon Williams
mostly, though they have played with Susan and may play with Moonpup
sometime soon).  Really nice people, too.

It was a fantastic time, and the first time for me at the Candlestick
site, which worked out great, much better than I had hoped...

BTW, it was Jenny's second rave (my dog) and she loved it... to be
honest, I have no idea how she ended up the way she did, she's very
adaptable to weird situations, and I was really happy that she was
enjoying herself and behaving herself and that people obviously
enjoyed having her around.  Pretty cool.  My best guesses as to the
cause of her mellowness / sense of play is a) a cool dad :-)  b) a
happy puppyhood c) the 5 pounds of marijuana brownies she ate when she
was 9 months old... and we've been practicing the dancing since she
was about 1 year old :-)

Yow,
Bob

PS and of course, the event was even made more special with the strong
sfraves contingent, you know if you made it... thanks for making it a
special night for everyone!  (and it was nice to meet Fred Heutte in
person, too!)

want the actual text of the bill,  it was introduced by Sen. Don Edwards, CA.

-----



Yesterday at our last general meeting of the semester, Nancy Brown,
the New England coordinator for Families Against Mandatory Minimums,
spoke as a guest.  Some of the things she had to say appalled me.

She began her speech by rattling off a list of sentences delivered
under the Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Guidelines now in effect in this
country.  The list was just the tip of an iceburg, but even so, it
contained several sentences which could only be described as utterly
insane.

For those of you who are unaware of what Mandatory Minimum Sentencing
is all about, I will breifly describe to you this system.

I have sitting on my desk a chart which Mrs. Brown gave me, along
with other materials.  On one axis is the severity of a criminal
offense.  On the other are what can be best thought of as the opposite
of `brownie points' called Criminal History Points.

When a person is convicted of a crime in this country, their 
criminal history is examined and they are given criminal history
points according to guidelines set forth by the federal government.
Their offense is also assigned a severity rating by another set
of guidelines.

A judge, when determining that person's sentence, does not need
to use his own discretion, he just looks up the sentence on the
chart and off they go to prison.  In fact, the judge is not
allowed to adjust the sentence on the chart ... downward.

Exceptions to this rule are afforded for the following reasons:

1) The defendant ratted out somebody else
2) The defendent must be hospitalized, or in-house detention
   is deemed adequate for this case (i.e. a handicapped person)

The entire attached document, which describes the Criminal
History Point system is cleverly written to discourage the very
thought of reduced sentences.  100% of the examples given which 
describe a situation where the sentences may be altered, describe
an increase in the sentence. 

So what happens when a person is convicted of an offense which
requires, say, a ten year sentence, and they only deserve, say,
two?  They get ten.  Period.  End of case.

Now the system which I have described seems very logical at first
glance -- applying a uniform sentence based on history and severity
of offense -- which is probably why it has been in effect for so
long.  But let us take a look at what has happenned during that
period.

I was also supplied with the following statistics.

o  The US now has the highest incarceration rate in the ENTIRE WORLD.
   425/100,000.  Only the former Soviet Union and S. Africa come close.
o  From 1975 to 1990, the US prison population has more than quadrupled
   We now imprison people at a rate 4 times that of most European
   countries, with no noticeable effect on the crime rate.
o  The US now has 1.2 million people in jail or prison.  In order
   to provide for our weekly influx of 2000 prisoners, we would
   have to build 4 new prisons a week, that's $2billion/month
o  The cost to maintain our current prison population is $16 billion
   a year.  Each prisoner costs $20,000 per year.
o  Corrections is the fastest growing public sector employment.
o  One out of every four African American males are in custody
   on any given day.  This compares to 1 out of 16 for South Africa.
o  If we continue our present rate of prison population increase,
   1/2 of our population will be in prison by 2053.

It is plain to me that this constitutes a problem.

Attorney General Janet Reno has called for a reveiw of these guidelines.

Justice Mocked; The farce of mandatory minimum sentences. 
By Colman McCarthy

A year ago Patricia Martorana, a 20-year-old woman I came to know and
admire when she had been a gifted student leader at Vero Beach (Fla.)
High School, was attending Valencia Community College in Orlando. She
waited tables to earn tuition money. Her career plans included earning a
degree to work for the Florida forestry department as a wildlife
conservationist.

Today Martorana is caged in a federal prison in Marianna, Fla. She is
three months into a two-year sentence after plea bargaining to a charge
of conspiracy to distribute LSD.

I doubt if any member of Congress had Patricia Martorana or citizens
like her in mind when the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act was passed.
Amendments that were a pitched response to get tough on drug offenders
set mandatory minimum sentences. Judges were left with no sentencing
options. The congressional intent was to cast a judicial net so wide and
tight that, at last, drug lords and kingpins would be snared and given
the stiff punishment they deserved. And members of Congress could
champion themselves as winning the war on drugs.

They're winning all right - small. Patricia Martorana, whose case is not
unusual, according to legislative and judicial groups that monitor the
effects of mandatory minimums, was a nonviolent first offender. She did
not deal, buy, sell or use drugs. Her "conspiracy" to distribute LSD, as
detailed in the plea agreement with a federal prosecutor, was marginal
and fleeting at best.

Last May, Martorana was phoned at home by an undercover agent posing as
a buyer. He had been given her number by a high school friend of
Martorana. The agent, along with a government informant who was
cooperating to have time cut from his sentence from an earlier drug
crime, was directed by Martorana to someone she knew at work who was a
dealer. The agent paid him $1,340 for 1,000 dosage units of LSD.

Martorana was given $100 as a commission by her co-worker. In a stakeout
of the young woman's apartment, surveillance agents learned it was there
that the dealer transferred the LSD to Martorana's high school friend,
who then sold it to the undercover agent outside.

For this role in a relatively minor drug deal set up by legal
entrapment, and in a state teeming with violent and huge drug rings, a
young college student is now a federal prisoner. When Martorana was
sentenced in early November, a family member recalls, the judge
expressed a sentiment of frustration routinely heard from the bench: the
mandatory minimum sentencing law gave him no choice but imprisoning the
student for two years. He was forbidden to consider that this was a
nonviolent first offense or that Martorana's participation was small or
that her mother recently died of cancer and her father is disabled.
Probation, community service or counseling was out.

On Feb. 17, Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.) introduced legislation calling
for an end to mandatory minimums. He was responding to the increasing
opposition to the restriction from the American Bar Association, judges
in all 12 judicial circuits and the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

Occasionally a jurist can no longer take it. In late 1990, a
Reagan-appointed federal judge in San Diego resigned because of
mandatory minimums: "They have destroyed the discretion of judges," J.
Lawrence Irving said. "They are grossly unfair to the litigants. For the
most part the sentences are excessive, particularly for first-time
offenders."

It works the other way, too, as in "guideline sentences." This is a
process by which drug kingpins can bargain for lower sentences if they
cooperate with prosecutors by fingering others in the ring. A mandatory
sentence can be avoided by naming names. "The moral of this story," says
Julie Stewart, director of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a
Washington advocacy group, "is that if you're going to get caught on a
drug charge, be a kingpin. You can talk and get off lightly. It also
means that those who have little or no information to bargain with get
the hardest hit. They're the least guilty."

FAMM's files bulge with cases of citizens serving drug sentences of 5,
10 and 20 years without parole chances for first and often minor
offenses.

Inside her Florida prison, Patricia Martorana sees the injustice up
close: "There are women here serving 10 to 15 years on charges of drug
conspiracy. They are doing more time than some murderers. I would say
that over 50 percent of the women here are first offenders."

All are doing hard time, compliments of a simplistic law passed -  and
kept on the books - by an unthinking Congress. In addition to
brutalizing the lives of people like Patricia Martorana, justice itself
is mocked. Forced to obey mandatory minimums, judges can't judge. They
can only process, stamping defendants as they pass by like slabs of meat
on a judicial conveyor belt. If the 1986 law has had a measurable effect
on drug deals, it's news to the judges.

I was very disappointed by the UFOrb release party (except for the free

high-end; in fact, I've heard much better home stereos.  Also, the film/video
projections were small and hard to see.  Is there something more planned
for this event than just listening to the CD?  I saw an ad which mentioned
Jonah from SpaceTime, and I have also heard about an afterparty on a

Seth,
 I realize that peoples experience of a party is subjective..but I have to
add my review of the "Patterns and Textures" showing last year.
I had a blast,especially enjoying the long stupendous Orb videos, especially
"Patterns and Textures" which is easily the best music video Ive ever seen.
(and I'm a crusty type who doesnt bestow complements lightly...)
And Charles{ambient stuff{_ was perfect
Sorry to go on.. but I think it was the best $5.00 I spent last year in an
indoor event. What a deal.. they even gave out the free Orb CD.
What do you get for $5.00 these days,not much!

Subject: Is There Raving In Hawaii?


-- 



Question: IS THERE RAVING IN HAWAII?

Answer: i think so ...


 On my visit to the original 808 State* last week , I unfortunately had 
little time for a decent investigation of the local rave scene . Here's 
a report based on the little I was able to find out.

 A tabloid published in Honolulu called DEEP was my main source of 
information . It seems to be a very recent publication , being up to 
issue #4 . Self described as "Hawaii's Coolest Entertainment Magazine" , 
it carries articles and ads focusing on music and fashion , as well as 
poetry and fiction . Lots of computer graphics are used in the 
illustrations.

 There was a cool article titled "Understand This Groove" that was an 
explanation of raving music! A great , terse piece written by DJ Meta-4 
that covered all the basics. As a clue about the acceptance of rave 
music in Hawaii , this quote from the article - " As mainstream Hawaii 
is finally picking up on rave and techno (with cuts like the Smart E's 
"Sesame's Treat" and Bizzare Inc.'s "I'm Gonna Get You" actually getting 
on Top-40 radio), really progressive house/techno music fans are going 
into the heavily rhythmic and non-lyrical music that can be found on 
this month's ( recommended ) CDs " . The recordings that where 
recommended were "House Sweet It Is! Don't Techno For An Answer, Vol3" , 
"Warehouse 8" , and "Future House - Best of House Music Vol. 4".


CLUBS --------

 As far as club raves go , the main clubs seem to be Pink Cadillac , The 
Garage , and Zone 24. The Pink Cadillac is located at one end of Waikiki 
, while the other two are located well away from the Waikiki tourist 
ghetto. 

 I only got to the Garage , on Tuesday "skirt" night ( wear a skirt , 
get in free - no , I had to pay !). The club has the look of a converted 
warehouse or shop , and it is located in an industrial section of 
Honolulu. The interior had two bars , a section with about 4 pool 
tables, an upper lounge area, and a dance floor and stage. It was 
somewhat dead that night, with only 10 dancers max by the time I left at 
12:30AM. The music wasn't mixed , just segued, with many instances of 
silence between cuts. The ticket guy at the door said that Thursday , 
Friday , and Saturday nights had DJs that did live mixing. Groups such 
as LA Style , Skankin Pickle , Dance Hall Crashers, and other bands have 
played at The Garage ; the venue has also hosted rap acts. And DJ Spun 
did his thing as part of an 808 State show here in May.

 The venue I was eager to check out was Zone 24 , but I didn't make it.  
Club motto - "This Is No Gansta Zone" . The advertisement in DEEP 
promised "Music For Progressive Minds" on two dance floors - " ROOM 1: 
house , tekno , tribal , disko , rare groove  ROOM 2: alternative , 
progressive , grunge , goth ,ska " . It's located on a major street , 
across from the huge Neil Blaisdell Cultural Center. The only exterior 
sign of its existance is a banner with " Zone 24 " on it - looks like a 
converted store or office.

 Looks like a new nightclub is opening up , called The Attic , which 
promises "the ultimate party experience". No address listed in the ad.

 LEGAL DRINKING AGE - Was 18 years , but Hawaii's legislature changed it 
to 21 years old to match federal guidelines. There was some anxiety 
expressed in DEEP's articles about the clubs going 21+ , as some boozing 
underagers were caught by undercover cops at The Pink Cadillac and The 
Garage.


UNDERGROUNDS ----

 The one underground rave that I was able to find out about was Chapel 
of Love. They seem to hold monthly events at different spaces on Oahu.


----------------------------------------

 That's my short report - if you're going to Honolulu , I suggest that 
you visit a record store or "modern" clothes store and ask the customers 
or staff for the latest information, and don't forget to pick up a free 
copy of DEEP before you leave.

Subject: Earth Beat Was Incredible!!

Earth beat was mind-bending though a little sparsely attended. Best music
I've heard in a long, long time.

First, when I got there, Simon was spinning. There were only about 10
people and he was just kinda being mellow. As soon as people arrived
though, he kicked it in an raged pretty hard.

He was followed by Josh who entirely blew everyone's mind. As if this
wasn't enough, Tony then comes on and takes to an even higher level; truly
inspired, I've seen few DJs get as deep into the groove as he was that
night. Garth followed him and completed the night in his ususal
mind-bending fashion. He finished up with a track, while the cops were
waiting to close it down at 6am, that must be called "Can You feel the
Thrust" cos that refrain repeated; reallly fast upbeat slammer.

Killer space too, ILWU union hall on hegenberger rd in Oakland; small
intimate space with real;ly cool security who basically hung out on the
dance floor and enjoyed themselves all night :)

Sound was awesome too, two exact FMR systems in four corners.

I will never miss an Earth Beat again. Vibe out of control....:)\

see ya

Subject: Pyramid Lake July 17th-19th

I am definitely planning to go this rather than the Rave-a-palooza called
Cyberfest (cyber- ?)  Anyways, we should perhaps get together and see who
all is interested in going.  I know I was super late in organizing the SLC
trip, so I'm gonna get a jump start this time.  The good news is Pyramid
lake is much closer, only 5 or 6 hours away (about an hour past Reno), but
still it may behoove us to consider an RV rental or something.  It's also
$30 for the whole weekend, which I admit is a lot of money, but hopefully
it'll mean they can put a lot of production into it too.

So, if you are interested, send me a line.  One idea is to rent an RV in
Reno, so we don't have to drive it so far....

Subject: BreakBeat MixTape

Greetings =)

	In light of many recent requests for a breakbeat mix tape from
various people, I am making one of my own available to everyone.  All you
have to do is send me a blank tape and enuff $$ to cover postage and I'll
dub you a free copy.  I am not sure about postage rates (I think it takes
3 stamps to mail a tape in the continental US).

	I made the tape in early May using a beat up Radio Shack mixer and
some extremely shoddy headphones (not making excuses tho ;).  It is all
breakbeat.  The first side is on the harder/darker edge and the second side
is more uplifting and housey.  A good tape to pop in the car on your way to
work =)

	Note : I only ask that if you get a copy of my tape and you know any
	       promoters who are throwing a rave, let them hear it or let
	       them copy it from you.  It's cool with me ;)

  OFFICE MEMO         Earf beat!                            Date:  6/28/93
Well, after a loooong Friday night (sorry, went to Xochi, but once we got to
the location and had to face that drive back to the city and go to candlestick
at 4am, we just went home and slept....), my friends and I looked forward to
good night at Earthbeat.
Earthbeat was really cool, in the long run...it was very small, the crowd never
got that large, even for the somewhat small space--a strange hall near the
Oakland airport.  there were about 20 people there for awhile, but at 3 am the
place was fairly hopping!  Simon started off (why?  he's so incredibly good
(IMHO) that he should be near the middle of the night) and was ripping, and
then Josh came (which was good--last time he closed..ouch!) on and ripped
things up, but then Tony!  Tony has gotten better and better each time  I have
seen him, and Saturday night, the guy just went beserk.  He tore the dance
floor UP!!  He was incredble!  EJ showed up, but left, and Tony just kept
blowing us away.  Garth came in and danced for awhile, probably trying to
figure out how he would top Tony, and when he came on, Garth was like his old
self from last year or so--he just went CRAZY and played the most vicious
house/trance/disco sort of FUNK that the crowd went nuts.  Unfortunately the
cops came in and stopped the party--which was too bad, especially since the
planners had permits and everything....you have to wonder.  I mean, we were in
the middle of an industrial area on a Sunday morning.  What was wrong?!  It is
upsetting, to say the least..
I was too burnt and tired (working 9-5 does that) to do any after parties, and
we didn't check the beach...

Which poses the question--is there still a beach party thing going on?  how
about the park?

talk to you all later

If your worried about production quality perhapse you should help
Universal Studios organize their "rave experience" :)

Yeah I'm going, I'm taking Shadowfax (my little CRX) out there with her
new engine (I'm even installing a tape player for the trip!)
$30 is NOT a lot for 48 hours of continuous entertainment plus remember this
is SUPPOSE to be a benifit.  I'll be REALLY PISSED if us ravers cheat the
native americans, who have opened their land to host us, out of a reasonable
amount of revenue.  I can understand people having benefits and not breaking
even but to stage something as a benefit so that you can have an excuse to
keep your cost down when having a party is slimey to say the least.

Frankly I can't see how they are gonna pay all the DJ's and stuff on ONLY
$30 a person, let's see $30 at maybe 300 people max, thats $9000, hum.
now $30 at 1000 people... thats more like $30,000. now we're talking!!

I hope people focus just a little on the fact that this is Native American
land that we will be on.  Be respectful, these people have had everything robbed
of them, please show some respect and allow them their dignity.  Don't throw
trash all over the place, be awake and THINK (It ain't illegal... yet) BEFORE
YOU ACT!

Spent several hours watching the Gay Pride parade on Sunday,
and I hardly heard any disco this time.  Instead lots of
people were playing housey techno.  

Walking down Market Street after the parade we were hearing
some really nice techno coming from somewhere... turned out
to be some guy up on the fifth floor with a sound sytem out
on their fire escape.  Very cool. 

(The night before, Jill went to Earth Beat with a friend of
hers.  She had to leave early (pre-Garth), but it sounded
like she thought it was only okay.  The place seemed like
some sort of youth center, and there were "cops" all over
the place -- though that's probably a necessity for an
Oakland party, unfortunately.  It was sub-$20 ($15) and 18+,
too, both of which they deserve some credit for...)

$15. Lyon Security. No visuals. Music was quite good. Ice water was
free (!!) ("save your paper cup - recycle"). Warm fuzzy feeling from
the promoters.

I dunno, maybe I need a prescription for Prozac but I felt pretty
alone there. Lots of people standing around exuding attitude. Lots of
people dancing not friendly all internal not looking at each other. No
smiles returned (cept for Abigail at the water table).  Kinda
like a Manhattan island sidewalk crowd at lunchtime, you know?

That's why I *really* liked YSH. It felt like family.

Lyon security, as usual, was professional and very friendly. Unlike
cops, they don't seem to be constantly looking for somebody to do
something wrong.

This rave was maybe a little overpriced for what was provided, but
nonetheless I recommend going to another Earth Beat. The producers
seem human and interested in promoting the true spirit of rave(*). As
far as the crowd goes, maybe it was just me. I am starting to develop
some preferences :).

I tried for Xochopilli on Friday night, since I was really up for a
party on the beach, especially one in honor of the Aztec prince of
flowers, but that wasn't to be.

But I got to Earth Beat Saturday night and that was a fine time!
That was me with the red, blue, and orange glowing crystal wands.

I don't know any of the DJs, but one of them seemed to be playing
a more jazzy mix than the others, (sometime around 1 or so, maybe,
I don't wear a watch).  Who was that?  I really liked that set.

This was my first rave, although I have been drawn to the vibe in
other manifestations for many years (the Grateful Dead, drumming
circles...).

In case any of you are worried about the $30 price tag for this event, I
have a solution for you!  I have just talked to one of the people in
charge of this event, and we will be setting up ticket giveaways during my
radio show for the next two friday nights as well as during Minor Minor's
show on saturday nights.  We will most likely be bringing in guest DJ's,
and maybe even a live act to perform on the air.  As it stands now, 4
pairs of tickets will be given away each night (fri. and sat.).  This is
still tentative, so I'll post more when I know details.

Subject: Earth Beat

well, Earth Beat was pretty cool overall, with a pretty cool vibe despite a
small turnout.  The highlight was the music, which was utterly, completely,
absolutely out of control.  Good to hear Josh rocking in the early evening
again, 'cause he just knows how to rock OUT.  Simon was his usual awesome
self, and Garth went off the planet.  But it was Tony who came out with the
most unbelievably intense hard set ever!  What is the deal?  He is always 
quite good, but often is overlooked in face of 'bigger' DJs like Jeno or
Garth.  Man, he is so goddamn good.  Check him out for sure if you can!

Tried to go to Xochipilli, drove all tghe way from SF to the site, only to
be turned around by what appeared to be Scott Hardkiss.  Back to Candlestick?
No way.  The 1 1/2 hour drive there was long enough for us to say screw going
back to the city, so we went and slept in Santa Clara.

Mike and I really are thinking strongly about going to the Pyramid Lake event.
Sounds really cool, and the Wicked people are gonna be there.  Am I ready for
the drive?  Yup!

Subject: Alt.rave FAQ ver 2.0

Here is the most recent FAQ for this newsgroup.  Like any document that
tries to be all-encompassing, it has holes (hell, the U.S. Constitution has
had 26 amendments!).  Here are the more glaring ones:

I need a write up for the genre of acid jazz
I need new samples for the music genres lists.

and of course, I'll always need updates for music stores, radio stations, 
and other resources.  

Also, I'm working on developing the FTP site a bit, at soda.berkeley.edu.
What I'd really like right now are any stories/advice/anecdotes from 
people out there who have been involved with or thrown parties, large
and small.  I'm gonna scour the sfraves and neraves archives for some, 
but if you know of others or have some handy please send them my way.
I want to make the "/pub/sfraves/holdyourown" directory be a powerful
resource in helping others organize outdoor parties, both legal and
renegade.

Anyways, enjoy!  You know where to send comments, gripes, marriage
proposals, etc....

0   Introduction to the FAQ

	Raves are, if anything, the ultimate subjective experience.  Your
perception of how well or how badly a rave "goes off" is based at least
70% on your state of mind (and depending on the circumstances, 100%).  
Therefore, it's impossible to create an FAQ which is entirely objective.
I'll do my best.  I am MORE than happy to incorporate other's suggestions
into the FAQ, to include dissenting opinions and statements, within reason.
This file is not the be-all and end-all of rave culture; many of the topics
here will simply be introductions to the subject and point to the little
rave FTP site I've created at soda.berkeley.edu under /pub/sfraves (named
for and housing the archive of the sfraves mailing list, a description of
which will follow).  There's simply TONS of stuff there.  And for the rest
of the document, whenever I refer to "the ftp site", I mean soda.

	This document should also serve as an introduction to alt.rave. 
Alt.rave has been alive since early 1992, and has an extremely wide
distribution.  At last count an est. 20,000 people read it.  As is usual on 
USENET, people often have strong opinions which clash with others' strong 
opinions.  If everyone accepted the view that reality is subjective, and 
that on matters of taste there is no dispute, then flame wars become a
thing of the past.  Posts like "Orbital sucks, and the Orb can kiss my
butt" are probably inappropriate flamebait.  Rewording it to say, "I am
disappointed by the new Orbital because..." is a lot better.  Many people
also complain about too many posts about a particular subject, or group,
or country, etc...  to which the standard response is, start talking about
what you want to hear.  Finally, there was a big debate about whether to
create alt.music.techno, to "distinguish" the music from the scene, and
the idea was backed away from, with the view that discussion about rave/techno 
music is completely appropriate on alt.rave.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1   What is a "rave"?

	The term "rave" has been overused almost to the point of losing
its meaning.  The word has always meant (according to webster):

>1. rave \'ra-v\ vb [ME raven] 1a: to talk irrationally in or as if in 
>   delirium 1b: to declaim wildly 1c: to talk with extreme enthusiasm 2: to 
>   move or advance violently : STORM : to utter in madness or frenzy - rav.er 
>   
>2. rave n often attrib  1: an act or instance or raving 2: an extravagantly 
>   favorable criticism

	In general practice, a "rave" usually refers to a party, usually
all night long, open to the general public, where loud "techno" music is
mostly played and many people partake in a number of different chemicals,
though the latter is far from necessary.  The number of people at the
event is unimportant; it can range from 50 people to 25,000 people.  The
cost of attendance is also unimportant - there have been good raves and bad 
raves at both ends of the cost spectrum (though in practice, the higher the
price, the more commercial the event, and the lower the quality).  At a
rave, the DJ is king - he controls the psychic voyages of the dancers through
his choice in hard-to-find music and his skill in manipulating that music,
sometimes working with just a set of beats and samples, into a tapestry of
mindbending music.  A large part of the concept of raves is built upon 
sensory overload - a barrage of audio and very often visual stimuli are
brought together to elevate people into an altered state of physical or
psychological existence.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5 The "House Vibe"

	The actual concept of raves is not new - it is as old as time itself.
As the base level, raves are very comparable to American Indian religious
ceremonies, i.e. pow-wows, and also to the concept of the Shaman in Eskimo
and Siberian society - where music is the key towards pulling oneself into a
unique emotional and psychological state, a state in which one experiences
washes of sensations and visions, not delusions, but visions.  Sounds very
hokey in print, but I'm sure MANY of you out there know what I'm talking
about.  The hypnotisizng effect of techno music coupled with the seemless
transitions and themic progressions of rave DJ's as the night progresses
can be QUITE intoxicating, resulting in what could be closely compared to a 
religious experience.  Music in general has always been able to sweep
people off their feet, but what distinguishes raves are the concept of
the _shared_ experience; a feeling of unity often arises, and people are
open and friendly to one another.  There is a loss of that "attitude"
that is omnipresent in normal clubs and even in life in general.  People
are celebrated for who they are, not what they aren't.  There are many
better ways to explain the above, and more than a few can be found at the
FTP site.

For a better, blow-by-blow description of what an actual rave is like,
please check the FTP site under the media/ directory, and get "image" - 
it's an article that appeared in the SF Examiner in February 1992, and
is perhaps one of the most comprehensive surveys of the rave scene ever
to appear in print.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2   What is "techno music"

	Opinions on this vary greatly, but there are a few ways to
distinguish techno from other types of music.  Overall, techno is
denoted by its slavish devotion to _the_beat_, the use of rhythm as
a hypnotic tool.  It is also distinguished by being primarily, and
in most cases entirely, created by electronic means.  It is also
noted for its lack of vocals in most cases.  Techno also usually
falls in the realm of 115-160BPM.  There are of course exceptions 
to every one of these rules, but these guidelines seem to survive the
"what about..." test most of the time.

	There has also been a significant use of samples in techno
songs, samples lifted in huge blocks and contributing a large share
to a song's popularity.  This can be both bad ("Theme to Sesame Street"
in Smart E's "Sesame's Treet") or good (Star Trek transporters sampled
in Eden Transmission's "I'm So High", giving YOU that transporting
feeling) or great (Tears for Fears sampled in Orbital's "Moebius").
This sampling has generated much controversy, and it is the opinion
of the author and many others that sampling is okay as long as the
sample is not the whole song; "Seseme's Treet" might be an okay song, 
but if you take away the sample (which was lifted verbatim from the
TV show), you don't have much of a song left.

	"Rave" music has several different forms:

[and before we proceed, remember the words of God's personal DJ,
Jon Drukman: "abolish labels."]

a. House

	House music is where it all began, when Chicago DJ's started
playing around with their Kraftwerk 12"'s with their soul records, and
a brand new object called a DRUM MACHINE which they discovered they
could use in their set.  The steady and clean sound of the house rhythm
coupled with uplifting soul vocals gave "house parties" an incredible
energy.  Please see "jackshouse" on the ftp site for a good example of
the mindset of this time...  House also uses more piano riffs and 
generally sounds "happier" than most other forms of music played at raves.

Good Samplers:  Best of House Music, Vol. 1, 2 (Gotta Have House), 
		and 3 (House Music All Night Long)
		Aly-us  "Follow Me"


b. Acid-House

	Acid-house developed when the Roland 303 and similar drum machines/
synthesizers came out producing the "funky worm" - that VERY distinctive 
sound (see any "Acid Mix" of any song) that just *sounds* liquid (sorry, 
that's the best way I can describe it).  The sound and the style is linked 
to use of LSD, but many people (myself included) claim to feel many of the 
same sensations while listening to acid-house music.

c. Techno

	It is probably best to split techno into three groups - proto-techno,
Detroit techno, hardcore, and "techno-rave".  (Thanks to Chris Hilker 
<cspot@cats.ucsc.edu> for the suggested split and following text)

c.1. Proto-Techno:

	Proto-Techno isn't really a style of music per se. It's merely a
concatenation of the various artists and styles that had the biggest impact
on the original creators of techno in Detroit. Hence, there isn't much
stylistic homogeneity here. Proto-Techno can be anything from the minimal,
assembly-line technopop of Kraftwerk (particularly the 'Trans-Europe Express'
album) to the nonsense, party-time funk-taken-to-its-illogical-extreme of
George Clinton's Parliament/Funkadelic to the early '80's hip-hop
mongrelization of the two in the Electro genre.

Examples:
	Kraftwerk: "Neon Lights"
	Parliament: "Flash Light"
	Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force: "Planet Rock"
	Cybotron: "Clear"

Further Listening:
	Kraftwerk: 'Trans-Europe Express' (Capitol CDP 7 46473 2, unfortunately
	out of print)
	Kraftwerk: 'Computer World' (Elektra 9 3549-2)
	Parliament: 'Parliament's Greatest Hits: Uncut Funk/The Bomb'
	(PolyGram 822 637-2)
	Various: 'Street Jams: Electric Funk Vol. 1' (Rhino R2 70575)

c.2. Detroit Techno:

	The hallmarks of Detroit Techno are a stripped-down, aggressive funk 
sound, played mostly on analogue instruments (the Roland TR-808 is a favorite 
drum machine), and, most of all, a pounding, severe rhythm. Vocals are rare. It
has no "soul" in the traditional Motown/Stax sense of the word, which is not
to say that the music is devoid of feeling or emotion - it's just that the
expression thereof is unconventional. "Magic" Juan Atkins, Kevin "Reese"
Saunderson, and Derrick "Mayday" May are the names you need to know to fake
your way through a conversation about Detroit Techno.

Eric Iverson <EIVERSO@cms.cc.wayne.edu> writes:

	For those not in the know, Cybotron released their first contributions
to Detroit Techno in 1981--handily preceeding _Planet Rock_ and a host of
other Electro Funk. They were also an active part of Detroit's radio and
club scene. True, they didn't hit their stride until a couple years later
when they would produce _Clear_ which finally sounds less like technopop
and more like techno proper. By 1985, Atkins, May, and Saunderson had
all firmly established themselves as recording artists. They will always
credit Kraftwerk and Parliament as their inspiration. In fact Kraftwerk
and Clinton have both, at times, claimed responsibility for the Detroit
techno scene.
 
Where was house? Could it have had an affect on Detroit techno? Sure!
Was the affect as strong as late-70's Gary Numan or Ultravox's _Vienna_?
Probably not! Kraftwerk's _Computer World_? Never!
 
Cue 1987...House is happening in England and Derrick May arrives
with his record _Strings of Life_. The stuff catches on. The Techno
movement goes into full swing. Not only do the "Holy trinity" have
techno for UK consumption, but so do a bevy of others...Blake Baxter,
Eddie Fowlkes, Kenny Larkin, Carl Craig, and more. All from the Detroit
scene with roots that are clearly delineated. They didn't just pop up
from the house scene, though obviously they benefited from it.
Would they have existed without house? I think so. Would it sound
different? Well, it already does sound different!

Examples:
	Inner City: "Big Fun"
	Rhythim Is Rhythim: "Nude Photo"

Further Listening:
	Various: 'Retro Techno/Detroit Definitive: Emotions Electric'
	(Network UK RETROCD1)
	Various: 'Techno One and Two: Electronic Dance' (Ten UK DIXCD 123)
	Derrick May: "The Innovator"

c.3. Hardcore Techno:

	Where Detroit stuff is mainly a hybrid of European technopop and funk, 
your average Hardcore song seems to be a  speed-metal tune played on 
Detroit-type instruments (although the TR-909 is the drum machine of choice). 
Hardcore Techno is easier to get up and hyped to than its Detroit counterpart.
Hardcore has brought much of the metal crowd into dance music, and reconciled
dance parties with the industrial crowd as well.

Examples:
	Human Resource: "Dominator"
	Second Phase: "Mentasm"
	N-Joi: "Malfunction"
	Tresor Compilations Vol. 1 & 2

Further Listening:
	Various: 'Only for the Headstrong: The Ultimate Rave Compilation'
	(FFRR 162 351 002-2)
	Various: 'The Second Chapter: Hardcore European Dance Music'
	(XL Recordings UK XLCD-108)
	Various: 'Turn Up the Bass: The House Party/The Ultimate Megamix 2'
	(Arcade Benelux 01 6720 61) (Weak mixing, but it contains 
	one-to-two-minute sections of nearly 50 songs, giving perhaps the best 
	overview of the hallmarks of the style available on a single disc)

c.4. Techno/Rave:

	Techno as product. When people complain about "techno by the numbers," 
they usually mean Techno/Rave. This style is generally soft and accessible. You
are much more likely to have a (stupid) rap or other vocal in a Techno/Rave
track than either a Detroit or Hardcore track. Examples include 2 Unlimited,
the Smart E's, and recent efforts by the Shamen. What MC Hammer is to hip-
hop, what Winger is to heavy metal, Techno/Rave is to Hardcore.

Examples:
	The Shamen: "LSI"
	2 Unlimited: "Twilight Zone"
	The Movement: "Jump"

Further Listening:
	Various: 'The Ultimate Rave' (EMI/Virgin/PolyGram UK CDP 798641 2)
	Various: 'Rave 'til Dawn' (SBK ????????)


d. Breakbeat

	Breakbeat is symbolized by the use of sped-up hip-hop beat samples.
Very often reggae tunes and influence are brought in, to good effect too
since most reggae is around 65-80bpm and most breakbeat techno about twice
that.  Breakbeat is very effective at getting the crowd moving, but its
hypnotic effects are somewhat less.

Eric Iverson <EIVERSO@cms.cc.wayne.edu> wrote:

	If we were only going to rely upon sound as proof of descent then I 
would be ever so quick as to trace all minimal breakbeat to a song recorded in
1965 called _L.S.D_ by the Yardbirds ("Little Games Sessions & More" E2-98214,
EMI).  And I would trace all 4-measure repeating analog synth-riff rave tunes 
to an early '70s album, _The Wozard of Iz_ by Bernard Krause (out of print).
Listen to either one and you'll hear the similarities. They will astound you!
However, simply sounding alike is not enough. In the case of the Yardbirds,
_L.S.D._ was not even released officially until 1992! It couldn't be the
parent of breakbeat, despite it's age!

Good Sample: Most of anything on Risin' High records.
	XL Recordings Vol. 3
	The Prodigy "The Prodigy Experience"


e. Ambient

	The genre is very well described in Mike Brown's Ambient FAQ
available from the ftp site.  Basically ambient (or ambient house) is
designed to lull your mind through more soothing rhythms and samples.

Good Sample: _Anything_ by the Orb.


f. Trance

	Very similar to both ambient and acid-house, trance is softer on
the ears and body than most techno, but still keeps you dancing (unlike
most ambient, where the effects are more profound if you SIT DOWN and 
listen).  It's designed to try and take you, literally, into another
world.  

Samples speak louder than words: Eden Transmission - "I'm So High" on
	Exist-Dance.  GET IT NOW.
	Also, "Stella" by Jam 'n Spoon (at least the non-ambient parts)
	and "Papua New Guinea" by Future Sound of London


g. Tribal

	Tribal is denoted by exactly that - rhythm patterns and sounds 
which closely mimic Third-World and Native American and other "World
Music" styles.  The connection between modern-day raving and ancient
musical and cultural rituals is thus established, and the dancer can
be transported to a more primal self (in theory).

Good samples: Studio X - Los Kings Del Mambo, 808 State - Reaper Repo


h. Progressive 

	This is the newest and least-well-defined genre; it's based less
on sampling, less on wailing divas, and less on hip-hop culture, and more
on authentic instruments, haunting melodies, and always around 120-125bpm.
There's always a strong beat, and at times it resembles acid jazz. The
appelation of "progressive" was given by a music magazine, so many people
wouldn't call it that, but so far no other name has come to replace it,
and it is fairly different from straight house.  This is the most popular
music at raves in San Francisco right now.

<mjbrown@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>:
	One could also say progressive house is "progressive" in
that those who make it are trying to bring back more interesting musical
arrangements with either more complex percussion or melody or both, whereas
the trend in the last few years was to strip down the sound to a raw, minimal
form.

Good examples: "Cry Freedom" by Mombassa, "Mighty Ming" by Brother Love Dubs
	       The Trance compilations vols. 1-3

h. Deep House

	"Deep house is a style of house most prominently influenced by a 
combination of gospel and old chicago strictly house beats. Look for wailing 
divas (I love them!) spooky organs and that old chord progression that we know 
and love. Deep house never nods in techno's direction..ever..

<dit@sybase.com>


And to close this "definitions" section:

"My main point is that techno comes from somewhere.  It was not invented in 
this scene, nor is it particularly new.  One can easily get the impression 
from the omission of this fact that the contrary is true.  Not only is it
responsible to acknowledge origins/sources, but other people may want to
explore the related types of music that they might not otherwise ever
hear about." - Tahl Milburn, tahl@tfs.com



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3   DJing

	The art of DJing has come full swing in the world of the rave,
where the DJ has replaced the live musician as the focal point for an event.
The DJ is now regarded at the "conducter" of his "orchestra" of two 
turntables and a mixer (and maybe a sampler, but that's not necessary).
The orchestra's "instruments" are the slabs of vinyl (or aluminum & plastic,
in Pete Ashdown's case) that carry the basic grooves and melodies, and it's
up to the DJ to ensure that the orchestra plays all their instruments in
perfect sync and with a measure of continuity.  The DJ must *know* his
music, know where the breaks are, know the keys, know the BPM's, to make
his/her set come out as perfect as possible.  Anyone who says DJ'ing is
just spinning records has never tried to do so.  DJs often develop a
following, and the level of devotion among some is something unseen since
the Beatles.  (Basically, if you have Garth playing at your event in San
Francisco, you can ensure 2000 people will be there, even with VERY minimal 
flyering - the same holds for Barry Weaver or Doc Martin in LA, or Adam X
on the East Coast)

	Right now information on how to mix is vaporware - if someone would
like to contribute something I'd be glad to add it.  All I can say is that
DJ'ing is one of those things that cannot be taught, it can only be learned
by doing, by sitting in front of a pair of turntables for a few months and
getting a feel for a pair of 1200's and a mixer, and knowing your records
well enough to know where the breaks are, which ones are fast and which are
slow, etc.  Develop a style.  Don't worry about doing fancy hip-hop 
transformations at first (and hardly anyone does that anymore, anyways)
Work on beatmatching - a well beat-matched 90-second segue will always
sound better than a stop-one-start-the-other mix.  

	A file of collected net.wisdom w.r.t. mixing and such can be found 
on the FTP site at soda.berkeley.edu under pub/sfraves/music/2.b.a.d.j.

4   Drugs/Smart drinks

***Please note: no one involved in the creation of this FAQ advocates***
        ***the consumption of illegal substances at any time.***


Preface:

	The subject of drugs at raves is very controversial.  One wonders
whether the rave scene would have been more easily accepted by the public
had the presence of drugs not been so high.  Of course, many other wonder
how raves could have ever come about without them.

	Drugs, like anything else in the world, are dangerous when used
improperly.  Please use caution if you do decide to use mind-altering
substances, both legal and illegal.  You owe it to yourself to gather info
before making a choice regarding drugs.  You have access to an incredible
amount of information on the networks here.  USE IT!

	The reason I am including drug info in the FAQ is not because I
think drugs are a necessary part of a rave nor even a significant part of
it, but because questions arise on the newsgroup frequently enough to
warrent its inclusion.

	There is a whole newsgroup devoted to drugs - alt.drugs, and any
and all questions about drugs at raves are probably more appropriate there
than at alt.rave.  This information is presented for informational
purposes only.  Please, if you decide to dose, please read up on and know
exactly what you are taking and what the expected affects are.


a) Smart drinks

	Smart Drinks are drinks made with nutrients that supply needed 
precursors and cofactors that your body uses to manufacture neurotransmitters,
the chemical messengers that carry impulses in the brain.  These 
neurotransmitters can frequently be depleted by heavy excercise, stress,
stimulant drugs, or lack of sleep, and many people report that amino 
acid/vitamin combo "smart drinks" seem to help.

	For more info see the "smartdrinks" file on the FTP site.

b) Ecstasy

	There is a LOT of worthwhile info to be gleaned from the FTP site
at soda.berkeley.edu, ftp.u.washington.edu, and alt.drugs.  

	The following is compiled from the Info-E flyers distributed around 
the Bay Area.

  * Methylenedi-what?? *
  The chemical name for Ecstasy is "methylenedioxymethamphetamine," or
  MDMA for short.  It is created in laboratories through an elaborate
  scientific process.  First patented in 1914 by the Merck Co. of
  Germany, its human use only goes back to the early 1970s, when it was
  used recreationally and therapeutically.

  Therapists found MDMA helped people to bring out their true feelings
  in a peaceful and open manner, and they used it that way, quite
  legally, for many years.  In the mid-80s it exploded into the
  nightclub scene in Texas, and was promptly banned.

  * What the government did *
  In 1985, MDMA was declared illegal in the United States.  Despite the
  objections of scientists, doctors, and even judges, it was placed
  along with marijuana, LSD and heroin on Schedule I, a classification
  of drugs with no recognized medical use and high abuse potential.
  Although therapeutic use is no longer legal, it continues to be used
  recreationally and socially.

  * The multifaceted jewel *
  Ecstasy catalyzes a powerful experience that takes many different
  forms.  It can provoke an intense, energetic, spiritual high or lead
  to warm, loving relaxation.  It can connect people freely and openly
  with each other or promote deep inner thinking and analysis.  Sensual
  yet not necessarily sexual, beautiful and sometimes dangerous, Ecstasy
  covers a wide range of human emotions, experiences, and passions.
  What you put into it is what you get out, so be sure to explore the
  many facets of the experience.

  * Those little annoying side effects *
  Although some people say it has no side effects, Ecstasy is not the
  perfect drug.  Users have reported a variety of mild physical symptoms
  such as jaw clenching, teeth grinding, eye wiggles, tightened muscles,
  sweating, chills, increased heart rate, blood pressure and body
  temperature, auditory effects, nausea, shaking, and next-day
  sleepiness.  Occasionally it can cause toxic reactions in people with
  asthma, heart conditions, diabetes, epilepsy, psychosis, or
  depression.  Remember, Ecstasy is a power drug.  Treat it -- and your
  body -- with respect.

  * As time passes ... *
  Myths abound concerning Ecstasy's effects after repeated usage.  Most
  claims (such as that it causes Parkinson's disease or drains spinal
  fluid) actually refer to other drugs or common misconceptions.
  Although scientists suspect some nerve terminal damage and
  neurotransmitter depletion in the brain based on animal research, the
  true long term effects and implications remain a mystery until further
  human research becomes legal.  By avoiding the temptation to use
  Ecstasy too frequently, you can lessen the risk and have more fun.
  [at the end of 1992, studies were begun into this with human subjects]

  * Less is more *
  An active dose of Ecstasy depends on one's body weight, sensitivity,
  and prior use.  A typical "hit" contains 75-125 milligrams.  Over 175
  milligrams increase side effects for many users.  Taking a larger dose
  does not necessarily mean a better experience -- it may be more
  "speedy," but less ecstatic.

  * Some tips for Ecstasy users *

  > Drink lots of water to replenish body fluids.

  > From time to time, stop dancing and chill for a while.  Take deep
    breaths and relax.

  > Maintain a healthy lifestyle outside the raves: eat a balanced diet,
    take vitamins, and get plenty of sleep.

  > Remember: Less is more.  Large or frequent doses can increase the
    side effects without adding to the experience.

  > Integrate what you've learned.  Think about your thoughts and
    feelings and try to apply them to real life.

  > Much of what is sold as Ecstasy is not pure MDMA.  Be cautious of
    what you buy and who you buy from.  Impurities may include
    amphetamine, LSD, heroin, or PCP.

  > Alcohol can reduce or change the effects of Ecstasy, and the
    combination can cause undesired effects.

  * Stay informed *

  Useful facts about drugs can be hard to find among the anti-drug hype.
  Here are some excellent references:

  `Ecstasy: The MDMA Story' by Bruce Eisner (Ronin Press) contains a
   good overview of the history, effects, use, science and politics of
   MDMA.  Try asking your local bookstore to order it.
 
  `PIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story' by Ann & Alexander Shulgin (Transform
   Press) is a novel about psychedelic chemicals and experiences,
   including MDMA.

  `Xochi Speaks', a full-color educational poster and booklet, provides
   practical info on MDMA and eleven other psychedelic substances.  Send
   a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Lord Nose!, P.O. Box 170473R,
   San Francisco, CA 94117.

  The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) funds

c) LSD:

  The drug LSD should properly be called a psychedelic (or the realitively
new term enthogen) and not a hallucinogen.  It typically does not produce
full-blown hallucinogenic effects where the users reality is entirely
changed.  The typical visual effects are composed of tracers (or trailers
or afterimages that follow behind moving objects -- in some people becoming
extraordinarily thick), warping of objects, and to some extent the
visualization of imaginary objects.  There are also cognitive and
perceptual changes while on the drug which tend to be the kind of thing
that is very hard to describe without experiencing it.  It tends to let
you see things from previously unknown perspectives, and it has a tendency
to break down internal walls around a persons ego.  The effects vary
widely between users, however.

  LSD tends to go good with raves for the following reasons.  The visuals
in the middle of hundreds of dancing, sweating people with flashing lights,
fog generators and everything can be an incredible experience.  And the
perceptual changes can help a person tune in to the atmosphere -- the
mood of the music and the mood of the crowd can make much more of an
impression.  Some people feel as though they are in a different universe
and connected up to a group consciousness.  Also, the drug is a stimulant,
which helps when you're trying to rave like crazy all night...

  The perceptual distortions from LSD *can* cause acute psychological problems
in people, panic attacks in particular.  For new users of the drug,
precautions should be taken so that set and setting is correct.  If a
person does start having a bad trip, its very important to try to
reassure them and calm them down.  In conjunction with trying to talk
someone down from a mildly bad trip, niacin or niacinamide have been claimed
to help bring them down.  For someone that is truely having problems a
benzodiazepine drug like Valium (diazepam) should be used -- A major
tranquilizer like Thorazine (chlorpromazine) is often used, but it tends
to turn the person into a zombie, which is an arguably bad psychological
state to be in immediately after having a bad LSD trip.  Experienced users
typically do not have any problems with bad trips, other than possibly
comparitively mild ones.

  LSD is typically sold on blotter paper.  These are sheets of paper, with
small (roughly 5mm x 5mm) squares cut on them.  One square (one hit) is
typically 100ug (micrograms) of LSD if its reasonably strong.  100 hits of
LSD makes up a sheet, 10 sheets makes a book, and 10 books makes a bible,
which is a full gram of LSD or 10,000 hits.  LSD can also come in liquid
form, as very (very) small capsules called microdot, or as a gel form that
looks somewhat similar to blotter paper called windowpaine. 
  For info on the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, long-term psychological
effects, synthesis, history or pretty much any other info on LSD, check out
alt.drugs.  (ps. there's no goddamn strychnine in blotter LSD -- see
alt.drugs for more info and flames).

d) Ketamine:

  Ketamine (also called 'K', 'Special K', 'Vitamin K') is chemically an
arylhexylamine anesthetic related to PCP.  It has medical use in burn patients
and also veterinarian use.  It is not, as of yet, a scheduled substance.
While the effects are somewhat similar to PCP it has less of a propensity to
induce a psychotic state.  Ketamine is considered a true hallucinogen by some,
with the ability to produce complete changes in reality.  It also tends to be
disassociative which is an effect somewhat similar to the cognitive perceptual
changes caused by LSD, only with a potential to be more detatched from reality.
Its anesthetising properties can cause the effect of "walking on mushrooms"
because ones feet become numb.

  The full effects of Ketamine are realized only when the drug is
administered intravenously.  It can also be taken orally, but the effects
are somewhat less and tend to vary much more than when taken i.v.

  Ketamine is not too uncommon of a drug in laboratories, and samples of
it do make it to the street.  However, PCP could easily be substituted for
Ketamine. Also Ketamine is rare enough that its quite likely that other 
chemicals and drugs could be sold as Ketamine.  Caveat Emptor ("let the 
buyer beware").

Again, folx, let's remember that raves are NOT all about taking drugs.  Thanks.

5   The visuals

	Visual effects are one of the most important parts of the rave,
but not always essential.  Sometimes the best parties have only a strobe
light, if even that much.  On the other end of the spectrum are the 
200-ft wide, screens drenched with projection, the 10-watt green lasers
bouncing off the disco balls giving the effect of laser rain, the miles
of flourescent tubing, the computer graphics which can blow your mind
away... it's a very large part of the "mindfuck" factor of raves.  

	Live visuals have been used since the 60's at concerts, using
overhead projectors and oil-and-water setups.  Those are sometimes still
used - and rotating color wheels in front of the projection beam can 
really add to the overall "trippyness".

	Strobes - $19.99 at yer local Radio Shack.  Cheap, but effective.
"Mind Machines" are seldom much more than small strobes with varying 
speeds that you wear inside glasses - but the effect of stroboscopic
light near the refresh speed (or half your refresh speed, or a quarter,
etc) of your eye can be quite hallucinatory.  You could probably build
your own Mind Machine for less than 10 dollars.

	Computer graphics - there are a couple of programs available
as freeware over the net that would be right at home at a rave.

MSDOS machines:

Fractint - available as wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/msdos/graphics/frain*.zip
	This one is the premier freeware fractal generation program.  Get it
	at all costs.

Acidwarp - available as soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/sfraves/spirit/acidwarp.exe
	This is a fantastically trippy computer graphics program.  
	Be warned, though, it doesn't work with every graphics card/BIOS.

Also available, somewhere out there, is dazzle.exe and o-my-god.exe, also
in the trippy-oo-aah vein.

The "big guys" all seem to really like Amigas - I see Digital Media truck 
them out at many raves I go to.  "Video Toasters" and "Mindlights" are two
additions for computers to fully integrate video. Various companies have 
sprung up developing "mindfuck" videos for raves - one amongst them being 
Hyperdelic Video.  They combine everything from cartoons to computer 
graphics to video feedback, and edit them together in a frantic pace, often
at 135 bpm so as to closely match the music.  Sometimes they will bring in
a live mixing board and edit the videos real-time.  One other group, called 
Synergy Visuals (reachable through tgrant@netcom.com) simply bring a computer, 
a VCR, a Sharp projector, and a mixing board, and go wild combining 
custom-written and very trippy computer graphics with video of everything 
from old Batman TV episodes to Fred Astaire.  

	Advances in projection technology have also helped bring the 
imagery to remote locations - a new single-tube projector from Sharp
is extremely compact and lightweight and can be set up outside, just 
about anywhere.  And Ikea and Sanyon reportedly make good models as
well.

	If you are looking to arrange your own visuals for an event,
I suggest you make ANOTHER trip to Radio Shack and pick up "The Mind's
Eye", a fantastic collage of computer graphics, in the $25 range.
Absolutely incredible looking.  "Beyond the Mind's Eye" is also available.

More videos: 

A company called "Media Magic" PO Box 598 Nicasio, CA. 94946 sells diverse
videos (including a ludicrous amount of fractal stuff), posters, etc

Liquid Oil Projections -  (thanks to Chris Beaumont, <ccat@netcom.com>)

	A widely available overhead projector may be used to project kinetic
liquid projections..  :ambient effect..  Use a overhead projector with bottom 
lighting,preferably with a quartz-halogen lamp. Put a dimmer on the main 
power, and if you can, add a supplemetal fan to insure adequate ventilation. 
Mask off the edges of the stage, place the dishes (old glass clockfaces) on 
top (a small one in a larger one) and add the water and oil based dyes, 
usually just to the space between the two dishes.  For oil dye, I use Keystone 
anilyne dyes, and for water, I use photo retouching colors.. 91% alcohol can 
be added to the water solutions to enable the water based liquids to become 
darker as they evaporate. For clear oil, of course clear mineral oil. With the 
colors,you'll learn less is more. Then you're ready to go, turn up the dimmer 
slightly and focus. Mask off the edges of the screen area, remembering to 
cover the edges of the screen-area as much as possible...Are your dyes ready?
Then turn the overhead up and   BLOB-O-RAMA!!!...  Remember..easy does it...
Good luck!

6   Creating techno music

a. E-quipment

Roland produced a series of electronic instruments in the early 80's all
with three character names. There's the 101 synth, the 303 bass line
sequencer (popular for acid house), the 505 drum machine (the 505 
is one of the first drum machines to use PWM samples for creation
of drum sounds) there's a 707 drum machine and the 727 . the 727 features
latin noises instead of the normal drum kit (miami sound machine uses a lot
of 727 sounds. listen for them if you can stand it) the 808 drum machine
has that big beautiful whooooommmmmm kick associated with early house
(not to mention drippy sustained highhat noises and snares). the 909
is a midiable pounding drum machine, it kicks. it's used in hardcore techno;
the majority of hardcore bands I've seen live have a simple 3 part setup,
some sort of sampler workstation/sequencer hooked up to a 909 and then the
909 syncs the 303. some even bring a dat machine along for backing tracks.

<jna@silver.lcs.mit.edu (John Adams)>

				****

The Roland MC-202 is a microcomposer, which means that you can program
songs into it.  It saves to tape.  It has sync and CV-gate but no
MIDI.  It makes some of the best bass sounds, comparable to nothing.
It produces a rounder sound than the 303 (which is a bit squelchy) and
the 101 (which is a bit noisy).  N-Joi and The Prodigy have stuff use
the 202.  (N-Joi used it in their "Live in manchester" album.  They say
"marky on the bassline", and it goes, BBBommeee.  And The Prodigy used
it in the bassline of "Everybody's in the Place.")

<mw@sybase.com>

				****

well the basic set-up is any computer that can be plugged
into some drivers including keyboard, drum machine, sampler,
sequencer, and fm modulators. NeXTS and Macs seem to be the choice,
although the new atari falcon (believe it or not) is going to kick,
largely because it has dedicated sound and video chips, so the cpu
can be used for everything else. i could go on, and i will if you
want - here's a list of products
korg wave station
yamaha sy77 and sy99
roland 808 (hence 808 state's name)
the M-1
the prophet (going back to kraftwerk)
hey - i'll just go check the midi studio i do my work in.

programming language for non graphic writing: lisp, and or c.

cheap means:

$14.99 at target. this can also be found at your favorite toy store. it is
called a voice changer.
it is like a megaphone, but you have three different switches on it: alien,
ghost, and robot.
the alien is a pitch up and down with robotic distortion
the ghost is a pitch up with the robotic distortion
the robot is a pitch down with the robotic distortion. resembles the cylon out
of battlestar galatica.
i am surprised i found this this cheap. >> LOADS OF FUN!!!
i am taking all of the handles and the cheesy plastic case off and just
utilizing the circuitry to make my mixer w/built in effects.
with a robot effect on a 909, guess what pounds the fuck out of your head
god, it is amazing....

Cool, maybe you two can come over to my place and figure out how to get my EPS
to talk SCSI to my Macintosh.

> we are interested to hear about what you are doing in your

I do most of my music stuff in my garage.  What happens in my bedroom is my
own business.

As far as music equipment goes, the best investment I've made in the past year
was in an Emu Procussion -- the ultimate drum machine.  It has tons of drum
sounds, from heavy metal to jazz to house to techno to tribal, with very
flexible programming capabilities.  (And it's midi too.)

My second-best investment was in Alchemy, which has an incredibly useful
constant-pitch time-shifting feature.  i.e. You can take a 90 bpm drum loop
and speed it up to 130 bpm without changing its pitch.

12  Throwing your own parties

	For those of you out there who have LOTS of spare time and energy,
the idea of throwing your own parties has probably crept into your head.
As a service to this, I have set up a directory on the soda.berkeley.edu
FTP site called "holdyourown", which I hope to fill with stories of people

Question:
        I like The Orb, and I keep hearing about a band called Orbital.
        Are they related?
        Will I like Orbital's music?

Answer:
        No and not neccessarily, respectively.

        Orbital are Paul and Phil Hartnoll (brothers), who have no connection
        whatsoever with The Orb. As far as I know, no collaborations or remix
        projects have taken place between the two. Should your local record
        store tell you that Orbital are The Orb's dance badge (I heard it said
        once) beat them around the head with a suitable record deck.

        Orbital's music is not ambient in The Orb sense, nor is it really
        techno or house. Some put them under the progressive-house label, but
        they seem to be one of those bands that don't fit in a pigeonhole.

The initial release, on black vinyl with a red label, was released initally
to dance specialty stores, but Michael Jackson's music publishing business,
which owns the rights to the Beatles catalog, heard about it and demanded they
be pulled.  These original 12"'s have garnered as much as $100 in trade.  A
bootleg was released a short time later, called "Jude on a Ragga Tip" (for the
song is really just someone with a good sense of timing playing both "Hey Jude"
and "On a Ragga Tip" by SL2, with MBM samples thrown in) and was backed with
"How Does it Feel?" by Electroset (a song which eventually did get official
permission for its sampling of "Blue Monday").

	This is not about raves so If you don't want to hear it 
	hit delete now...

	It has come to my attention that a number of us have
	mixed feelings about the recent Bombing of Iraq by the U.S.
	Rather than get on a soap box, I'm just going to pose a few
	questions.  You can correspond with me off of the list if you like.

	These questions are directed at your own sense of morals, you don't
	have to share the answewrs with anyone...

	1) What is terrorism?

	2) What is the difference between bombing an Iraqi "Intelligence
	Building" to "teach Saddam a lesson" (and killing innocent people
	in the process) and bombing the Secret Service complex of the
	WTC "to teach the President of America" a lesson, (and killing
	innocent people in the process) Both Saddam and the Prez. are still
	alive, 8 civilians in Iraq and 5 in the US are dead.

	3) Should the US act as the Police of the world?  Do we have the
	moral authority?

	4) Why is Iraq bombed for Saddam's actions but Syria not bombed for
	even more aggressive "support" of terrorist activities?

	5) How would you feel, if San Francisco was the target of a car bomb
	because of something George Bush or Bill Clinton ordered against 
	another country.

	6)  If we are "teaching Saddam a lesson" why is he still alive and
	so many Iraqi civilians are dead.

	7) Each tomahawk cost $1,000,000 (there were 23 of them) what do you
	think the people of Iraq would do if we offered them the money we spent
	on bombing them into submission on the condition that they get rid
	of Saddam?

	8) How many people do you kill to force a leader of a country to
	behave?

	9) Why are we bombing Bagdahd and not Capetown, or Bejing?

	10) How do you feel about the "United Nations" undertaking so many
	military adventures lately?

	11) Does violence really solve anything?

	12) If you look at the experiences we have in raving, can any of these
	insights be applied on a Global Level?


As I said, this is not to start a flame war or anything.  I just want
some of you to search your hearts before you condone military actions
against a population.  Think of how some of you felt at Pulgas when the
police started to put on riot gear, think of how you felt when the LA
riots were happening.  Terror comes in many forms, the US has been
blessed in the fact that it has never (in modern history) had any of
its cities destroyed.  Taking the life of an innocent "to teach a
leader a lesson" is no better than innocents being killed because they
are in the way of a "drive by" shooting.  What is the difference
between "gang violence" and the type of violence perpetrated by
nations?

Traffic has been light so I will add my comments.  I don't think a thread
about war/terrorism is too far off the subject of raves ;)
You can respond off of the list if ya like.

A few things have bothered me lately.

This country likes to bomb people over the weekend.  What is the deal with
this?  Is everyone mellow to the idea of minor military skirmishes as long 
as they hear about it while they are barbequeing?

Iraq was giving the UN inspectors shit and this surely influenced the
decision to bomb.  A few months ago Kuwait tortured (for a few weeks) a
handful of political prisoners and got an "Iraq did it" confession about
the Bush assasination attempt.  The US dismissed it, as it should IMO, but
as soon the UN inspector trouble started the FBI had new evidence that Iraq
was invloved - so we bombed them.

Now maybe there is "new evidence"  - I just haven't heard it yet.

I am afraid this weekend bombing trend is a warm-up for a more prolonged
air (bombing) war in Bosnia.  I really don't want to see this become a 
regular weekly segment on the sunday news ...

If we are going to be involved militarily overseas at all, Bosnia is
one of the places where we should have been a while ago.  Unfortunately
there isn't any compelling economic reason to do so, so the Govt.
(mostly under Bush) missed a big opportunity for a relatively
bloodless intervention.  (There is an entire armored division and
three armored cavalry regiments in S. Germany which could have done a
lot of good preserving the local infrastructure  until things cooled
down).  Unfortunately we (the U.S., the U.N., and the surrounding
nations) let the whole thing get way out of hand, and now the problem
is horrifying in scope.

Oh well.  Now there will probably be some action (largely ineffective)
because the cause has gotten more political than it used to be, when a
little planning and early action could have been very effective.

Usually, the difference between a Patriot and a Traitor is only a
matter of timing.

Those civilians are just as dead as George Bush would have been. How
many civilians is the life of one president worth? 10? 100? What is
the equation?

Our society is but the merest infant, still drooling and pooping all
over itself. Give it a thousand years or so, and perhaps it will learn
to stand?

At least someone proved Fermat's Last Theorem. One less thing to worry
about.

No kidding.  Desert Storm didn't accomplish it's primary (military)

That's less than $1 per person.  Good point, though.  Kinda like the
$2000000 per day it cost to keep the cops in Waco.

I don't know, I believe 35 million or so died in WWII...

There's no oil there.
Almost all wars are the direct result of socioeconomic pressures on
BOTH sides.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find a government in
recent history that has acted purely on moral grounds.

Better the UN than just the US, as long as other nations are actively
involved... being on active duty during Desert Storm kinda skewed my
opinions about 'joint' operations with the UN, though.

Of course.  At a gigantic cost, though, both in the incalcuable value
of the lives lost and in HUGE financial burdens placed on wartime
economies.

Trivializing the effects of violence (or claiming it doesn't 'solve'
anything) is irresponsible in the extreme, since eventually someone
who believes otherwise will come along and prove you wrong.  The start
of WWII is a good example... the U.S. was very unprepared for what
happened.

Well said.  It is the responsibility of the people to elect leaders
who feel the same way.  That is, if you believe our political system
has any chance of working.  I'm not sure I do anymore.

Subject: Diverse City


Hi all,

Friday night (while waiting for the Xochipilli phone message to be updated
to the new location) I checked out Diverse City (and drove right by
Candlestick thinking it would probably be a likely spot to have Xoc moved 
to :)

It was on Stevenson, between Market and Mission and 6th and 7th.  Quite
quiet outside, the only indication of a party being a few random people
getting in their car and a guy behind a barred and locked door at the
address given on the phone message.

After winding through the lower hallway to the stairwell, I proceeded up 
six flights of stairs -- the beat, at first non-existent, growing louder and
louder with each floor :)  At the top of the stairs, I find the entrance
blocked (?) and am told to use the elevator!  OK, down one flight and back
up.  (Was strange that the stairs were blocked since the top landing was
still outside of the party).

There was nobody in line and just a few people visible in the chill area.
They were still charging $10-, apparently still trying to break even, but 
the door-guy was good enough to let me in free for a bit.  

The sound was really good.  I'm not sure who was spinning, although I'm sure
it wasn't Shobahn, but the music was good -- I'd say progressive house with
lots of piano and vox samples.

The crowd was small (with lots of specialty rave wear) and on the younger
side (me being 25+ :), but quite a few people dancin' and trancin'.  I was
tempted to join in, but decided to give the Xoc line another chance before
committing.  On the way down, I rapped with some people on the elevator who
were really friendly (and without any help!) so despite any of my first
impressions, I'd have to say that the vibe was definitely focused.

Found a phone just outside on 7th, but it was out of order.  Should have
known, are all the phones in that part of the city out of order?  Eventually
ended up at Xoc just before the sound system got cranked up.  Definitely a
way cool party!  Good to see all the sfravers and watch the sun come up
across the bay.  And Thanks! to whoever brought that case of oranges for
breakfast!

Well, since you posed this as a set of questions, i thought i'd very
quickly type in a set of answers.  I'll leave this off the list to
avoid boring people with it...


	roy

----------------


  Geoff> 	1) What is terrorism?

Terrorism is violence directed against innocent people in a completely
arbitrary manner, and in a manner designed to seek publicity.  It is
calculated to instil fear into the population at large.

  Geoff> 	2) What is the difference between bombing an Iraqi "Intelligence
  Geoff> 	Building" to "teach Saddam a lesson" (and killing innocent people
  Geoff> 	in the process) and bombing the Secret Service complex of the
  Geoff> 	WTC "to teach the President of America" a lesson, (and killing
  Geoff> 	innocent people in the process) Both Saddam and the Prez. are still
  Geoff> 	alive, 8 civilians in Iraq and 5 in the US are dead.

None.  Except that the US is bigger than Iraq, and has more powerful allies.

  Geoff> 	3) Should the US act as the Police of the world?  

The answer is no.  Besides, at best, the US is a well-intentioned
vigilante -- no-one has appointed the US as a policeman.

I'm inclined to be less generous and strike the word "well-intentioned".

  Geoff>        Do we have the 	moral authority?

No, you don't.  (Sorry, but it was your choice of pronoun...)

No one country has any right to interfere in the affairs of any other,
except to do to minimum necessary to defend itself from an act of war.

  Geoff> 	4) Why is Iraq bombed for Saddam's actions but Syria not bombed for
  Geoff> 	even more aggressive "support" of terrorist activities?

Because the US authorities lie about their motives for military
action.  They appeal to the UN or the concept of "international law"
when it suits them, and they just as quickly sweep law under the
carpet...

  Geoff> 	5) How would you feel, if San Francisco was the target of a car bomb
  Geoff> 	because of something George Bush or Bill Clinton ordered against 
  Geoff> 	another country.

Well, it happens.  Terrorism is usually politically motivated, and it
happens in the US just like anywhere else.

  Geoff> 	6)  If we are "teaching Saddam a lesson" why is he still alive and
  Geoff> 	so many Iraqi civilians are dead.

Because the ability of the modern warfare to perform precicely
targeted strike operations has been hyped by the military
establishment?  Because the US's real intention was to perform an act
of terrorism on the Iraqi people?  (See my definition, above.)

  Geoff> 	7) Each tomahawk cost $1,000,000 (there were 23 of them) what do you
  Geoff> 	think the people of Iraq would do if we offered them the money we spent
  Geoff> 	on bombing them into submission on the condition that they get rid
  Geoff> 	of Saddam?

Is a tomahawk a plane or a missile?  Are you really telling me that
the operation used 23 million buck worth of bombs?

The amount of money spent on defence by the western governments is
obscene.  But the military establishment and defence industries have a
large vested interest in seeing this continue.

  Geoff> 	8) How many people do you kill to force a leader of a country to
  Geoff> 	behave?

Hmmm, this is a difficult one.  In a situation where many lives are at
risk, there could be an argument for assasinating a leader, though I'm
not entirely happy with it.  

I generally don't see that intervening in other people's war's is
beneficial in the long term, even if the aims are to try and stop the
killing.  The Gulf War is a prime example or the US getting involved
in a war which didn't have any military bearing on the US.  (ie of the
US acting as a self-appointed vigilante, acting for its own selfish
ulterior motives)

"Teaching Sadam Hussein a lesson" seems to be a very childish metaphor
to use to justify military action, even if there is real evidence of
actions which the US consider to be an act of war.  Besides, does a
formal state of war exist between the US and Iraq?  Thought not...

  Geoff> 	9) Why are we bombing Bagdahd and not Capetown, or Bejing?

See (4) above.

  Geoff> 	10) How do you feel about the "United Nations" undertaking so many
  Geoff> 	military adventures lately?

The UN generally does what the US wants it to, and if it doesn't, the US ignores it.

  Geoff> 	11) Does violence really solve anything?

As a gerenal rule, no, though there are always counterexamples to any generalization.

  Geoff> 	12) If you look at the experiences we have in raving, can any of these

Hmm, that's a hard one.  If our society was more open to the ideas and
mindset of the rave culture, then it would be less prepared to suport
terrorism like this just because the leader says it is necessary.
It's difficult to see how this change of attitudes can be
accomplished, though.  Part of the problem is that the miltary
establishment really *believes* in its own importance, and it is a
very powerful force.

well, i started skimming the rave faq and it looks great so far - i've got
one complaint, tho'.... in the first section (what is a rave? i think) it
says "the dj is king. He.... he.... his..." you get the point... what about
some gender-neutral language for djing, especially considering the long
discussion of sexism, gender etc. we just had on sfraves a few months ago? i
mean, this kind of language just perpetuates the image of a dj as male, and
considering what phat female djs i've been listening to (laura, heather

Barbarella: The Art of Dance
Wea/Harthouse/Eye Q: 4509-90679-2
1  128  09:13 My Name is Barbarella

7  133  06:08 Barbarella I
8  140  06:23 Barbarella 2000
9  132  09:00 The Mission

Comments:  A great concept with Sven Vath's talent behind it make for a swell
album.  Vath and R. Hildenbeutel have made one of the few dance albums with a
them that works well.  Barbarella is groovy on her own, but throw these guys
behind her and there is a desire for a remake on the movie, just for the
soundtrack.  I enjoy the melodic pieces in the beginning more than the hard
acid that starts with "The Future" and continues until the ending with the
hard trance of "The Mission".  The hard acid is really standard and out of
place after the bubbly, giggly, smooth beginning that fits the theme so well.
This album isn't as innovative as Vath's "Accident in Paradise" but it is a
lot more palatable instead.

Summary: 7/10.  If they could have held up the entire album without the acid
near the end, this would have been a 10.  Otherwise, "The Art of Dance" is a
quality production.

9       04:34 Minimalistic Source: Minimalistic Overchill
10      04:55 Synthadelic: Secretary

Comments: One of the few compilations that take ambient to heart and actually
push forward with an entire collection of beatless or low-beat ambience.
There is a decent variety to this disc, with a nice flow between tracks.
Definitely a prime example of how a pure ambient collection should be done.
Escape's use of a single Aliens sample in "Atmosphere Processor" works well in
the chords of a dark futurist piece, Sequential's "Saturn Cruise" moves and
mutates over difficult acid ambience with ease.  Synthadelic's "Secretary"
puts down an irony of harried office work over supreme relaxation.  "Tat" by
Syn will appeal to fans of industrial ambience with sparking subtle noise fest
in the analog realm.

Summary: 9/10.  Not for dance fans, but supreme listening and chill music.
Well compiled and mixed.

12 101  06:32 Tres Hombres: Fiesta del Suck
13  96  04:06 Free Base Factory: Brother Del Ray (Alive and Loaded)

Comments: A wacked compilation from 1990, FFT 1 differs greatly from the
excellent FFT 2.  The hard hardcore hasn't hit yet, and the bpms are average.
Even Mesculinum United bears more resemblance to industrial than acid core.
Although more tracks on here lend from rap and cliched German techno, there
are some unique sounds that make you wonder where they went.  Me on Bass does
an effective cross between dance techno and Skinny Puppy noise.  Bunker Youth
does a nice hip-hop beat with sound bites, guitars, and jazz thrown over the
top.  Elevation does a familiar sounding mix with nice breaks.  On the dumb
side, Whale Kommittee takes the Headhunter riff and doesn't do much with it,
T-Bone Castro makes a short theme with a cool sample, and then repeats it, too
many times.  Finally some really putrid live rap is thrown on as a bonus with
Tres Hombres and Free Base Factory.

Summary: 4/10.  Five really cool tracks, the rest are crap.  I'm glad FFT 2
was so much better.

8   99  05:09 Atlantis
9  117  07:47 Remember Exxon Valdez
10 124  06:10 Where is Dag?

Comments: Jam El Mar and DJ Dag are Dance 2 Trance, and as can be imagined,
this album does sound like Jam's airy chords combined with a Teutonic
influence of German techno.  The musical support of all the tracks is good,
but the samples tend to be overused, repeated, and dumb.  About the only
sample that works well is the Apollo 11 sample that fits the beat on "We Came
in Peace".  The Desert Mix of this song is drastically different from the
original, but is still excellent.  "P.ower of A.merican N.atives" is the
album's big hit, and deservedly so.  Pan flutes over a driving beat makes for
a trancy floor lifter.  Other good tracks are "Mr. Cannabis", "Freaks" and
"Kayenta" notably for their lack of soundbites.  "Remember Exxon Valdez" is
also a nice reworking of the original whale laden piece.

Summary: 8/10.  Nice to finally have an album of something from Jam El Mar.

12 129  05:52 Evolution: Equilibrium
13 105  06:12 Speedy J: De-Orbit

Comments: This is a strongly supported, but slightly crusty collection of
trance music.  Distinguishing this fact, is of course, "Space is the Place"
which has been placed on compilation after compilation in various
incarnations.  This mix is identical to the one included on "Rising High
Techno Injection", so don't let the tag fool you.  The Hypnotist track
originally appeared as "The Ride" on "Give Peace a Dance 3D", but this is a
significantly better mix.  The TZ 4 track is a bit of a disappointment, and
Resistance D and Speedy J's entries have been around forever.  However,
starting with Frank de Wulf's "Afrika's Rhyme" the collection shows off its
best stuff before ending with Speedy J.  There is this weird "Public Brain
Session" noise that ends each track, I have no idea what it is suppose to
mean, if anything at all.

Summary: 7/10.  If you don't have half this album already, this is a good
collection of stuff.  If you do, it doesn't make for bad filler.

11 127  05:38 Give It To 'em (Information)

Comments: One of the most descriptive titles for an album I've run across.
"Repetitive Digital Noise" is repetitive digital noise, with the emphasis on
repetitive.  Although "i" sometimes strays into boring digital noise, this
often isn't the case with sulfuricly acidic noise that would give Aphex Twin
something to worry about.  There is also an industrial ambiance to the album,
even though the beat is always present, a certain reminiscent quality harks
back to experimental Clock DVA and Nocturnal Emissions.

Summary: 8/10.  Not for the weak of heart.  Acid junkies will definitely
swallow this whole.  Could also be of interest to hardheaded industrialists.

11 164  05:44 Acid Heartcore
12 148  05:28 Joy of Life

Comments:  Upon purchase of this disc, I wasn't expecting much.  Even after
listening to the first few tracks, I was expecting more of the same dark acidic
hardcore that suddenly repopularized itself.  However, the album takes a
complete left turn into hard trance that bears a strong resemblance to
Arpeggiators work.  Then things really start to soar,  "My Key - My Love" is a
beautiful piano based trancer, "Vibrations" and "Dimensions" fall in the FAX
area of hard trance.  "Acid Heartcore" does another twist in the album, but
towards breakcore?  Yes, and very well done breakcore at that.  Finishing off
with the uplifting "Joy of Life" is a perfect way to end this simple, but
exhilarating album.

Summary: 9/10.  Simple, but a wide variety.  A nice trip over very danceable
styles.

I have a lot of feelings about this issue, in fact too many to go into right
now but another fact that I heard a couple of weeks ago was that the supposed
assasins were caught with drugs on them.  How many of you think it is very
likely that proffesional assasans on a top-secret mission to kill bush for
Iraq would be dumb enough to carry drugs on them?  I believe this had something
to do with their getting caught too.

Subject: Re: About Terrorism 


Hell, if the Iraqis managed to assasinate George Bush, sign me up as an
Iraqi citizen! I couldn't imagine any better-directed form of
democracy-affirming terrorism. An act of revolt at least as positive as
the american war of independence or the boston tea party. 

What's so bad about an assasination attempt against the man who has
been at the nexus of dissassembling Amerikkkan democracy for the last
three decades, ranging from Bush's purported involvement in the JFK
assassination as a CIA operative, his direct involvement in S&L
deregulation (which is one of the biggest reasons for our economy being
so utterly fucked nowadays), Iran-Contragate, the previous bombing of
Iraq to suck up to his oil buddies in Texas and Kuwait, and a brutal
war against the Panamanian people simply because Noriega (a CIA
operative) stopped being controllable by the US (and also to cover up
US's central role in south american cocaine trade). And don't forget
that we'd never be in a situation with a militarily-capable Iraq had we
not propped them up in our efforts to meddle with Iran.

If all this crap (and Vietnam) hasn't convinced the American citizen
that something is severly amiss with the government's foreign policy,
that the reigns are being held by blood-sucking pigs of the military
industrial complex.... then I guess we all deserve what we get... 

I for one am *PISSED* *OFF* at Clinton and his military-industrial
cronies for perpetrating this new act of aggression against Iraq. Now,
don't get me wrong, I'm no big fan of Iraq or Saddam -- but lets make
it clear, George Bush did more damage to Democracy and the USA than
Iraq ever could have done. 

I had (optimistically) hoped that our slate might be wiped clean with
the new democractic leadership and with all the Reagan/Bush entourage
of yes-men swept out of Washington. Alas... it was not to be.

For Clinton to give a fuck about a planned assasination attempt against
George Bush really shows his true colors, his mastery of subterfuge and
deceit. Who cares... the assasination (unfortunately) never happened,
so why the need to act? Is Clinton trying to prop up his ratings a la
Bush? Is America's malaise so deep that we need some more TV-warfare to
distract us?

Furthermore, violence begets violence. You think the Iraqis are going
to forget about the two aggressive incidents that have been perpetrated
against them? No! in fact, you can expect that the USA will now become
a  central arena for Moslem terrorist/war acts for the next 30-50
years. 

Future world wars (which we're trying hard to start right now) will
hinge on the battle lines that we're been drawing right now. The Iraqis
will never forget the hundreds of thousands of people we brutally
murdered -- their hatred for the US will be mostly independent of their
opinion of Saddam Hussein. It isn't as if WWI or WWII just happened --
they resulted from a lengthy simmering of tensions resulting from
previous acts of warfare and ethnic strife. 

Unfortunately, Amerikkka rarely takes the long view when it comes to
thinking with it's collective dick.

Furthermore, this incident will ensure that Americans will have a much
more difficult time visiting and understanding other cultures (esp.
Moslem ones) because even the most well-meaning of cultural emissaries
will become the target of terrorist activity abroad. This ultimately
has the effect of shutting down our ability to filter through the
bullshit they report on the TV news by visiting foreign countries and
seeing the truth for ourselves -- without the aid of the media morphing
the truth into lies.

So we'll just be further imprisoned within our so-called democratic
country, unable to sort the truth from the lies beamed into our living
rooms via TV. Double plus good!

I'll now return you all to the daily drone of ecstacy inspired positivity...
(Not such a bad thing either, given the bedraggled state of the world)...

I have to agree with Howard.  Peace only works when everyone does it and
certain situations warrant violence, including the Bosnia thing, IMO.  I
like to use the street anaolgy.  If you were walking down the street and 
an old lady was being mugged by a thug, would you intervene?  Now, in the
case of the U.S., you're a thug yourself.  Isn't it still a good deed if
you save the old lady from the other thug?  Is it still a good deed if
you do it knowing that you will be financialy rewarded by the old lady?
In all cases I think it's still the right thing to do even if your not
of the highest moral standing yourself and if you are still thinking of
yourself when you do it.

Actually, more shocking to me is that one of these events occurred on

Nothing.  Little late maybe, but what the hey.

On the other hand, the only thing wrong with blowing up part of the headquarters
of Iraq's rape/torture/execution organization is that the U.S. military 
gets the credit for it.  I can't hardly mourn the Mukhabarat, Shin Beth
or CIA when their operatives get blown up.  Just callous I guess.

To use your analogy... I think the best way to deal with this is to tell the
thug that the old lady's husband is the local Don... he'll get outta
there faster then you can blink and you don't have to beat him up.

As far as Saddam and the whole Kuwait thing, the whole affair could have been
avoided... Don't tell me that with all of the "birds" we have up in the sky,
we didn't see the troop movements weeks before, what about a little gunship
diplomacy ( i.e. ... the Navy announced fleet manuvers today in the upper
indian ocean... the air craft carriers nimitz, intrepid along with three
guided missle destroyers  participated in operation rude awakening...)
You get the point, send a few F15 squadrons up, maybe a SR-71 (or whatever
they have now) flyby of Bagdad at 4 a.m. just enough to send the message that
we know whats up and it's a no-no.

Think with your mind... not with your dick...

Subject: Re:  About Terrorism

Hello,

I am glad to see that this is being discussed, and hope that since things
political can definitely affect your day to day life, including raving,
that this topic is welcome... I am not sure of whether to send this to the
entire list, so please don't hack me to pieces with a rusty axe, but rather
let me know that you find the topic inappropriate....I leave my email in
your hands....I will reply briefly to what is being asked, and would really
like to see some discussion of this stuff, but if that's not to the list's
(i.e. the list's readership) liking, then it can and should be taken
offline...


-------------------
2) What is the difference between bombing an Iraqi "Intelligence
	Building" to "teach Saddam a lesson" (and killing innocent people
	in the process) and bombing the Secret Service complex of the
	WTC "to teach the President of America" a lesson, (and killing
	innocent people in the process) Both Saddam and the Prez. are still
	alive, 8 civilians in Iraq and 5 in the US are dead.
========
diff?  what diff?  this is about oil, power & money, IMHO.  rights and wrongs 
are the rationalization/justification for deeds acted out in the quest
for O, P & M (a new acronym!  yay!).  actually, oil is seen as the trump
card to money and power, if it wasn't oil it would be something else....
LIKE SOFTWARE!!!!!  IMHO, software is the next "oil" in world politics - 
so get ready, cuz these guys don't play fair.



next
-------------------
3) Should the US act as the Police of the world?  Do we have the
	moral authority?
==============
There is no moral authority to do something like this, IMHO.  It *is*
a nice rationalization/justification for keeping the military around, and
people like Dave Emory (of KFJC) have ALOT to say about our possible role
of world police force (WPF) [on white port & lemon juice (WPLJ)...], but
he might be addled from too much time spent trying to keep track of black
ops and other security/intelligence devilry.  It *will* make the military
powers that be feel better about their place in the world, and word has it
that they've been worried that they were running out of wars to fight...
cold or otherwise.  A better question might be:  "What can we do about it
and how can we do it?"



next
-------------------
5) How would you feel, if San Francisco was the target of a car bomb
	because of something George Bush or Bill Clinton ordered against 
	another country.
==============
I'd feel like we were paying the price for gov't/corp. bigwigs power
games - something we already do all the time...I was hoping BClinton
was going to be better than to go starting military conflicts, but now
I'm getting a little more worried...


next
-----------------
7) Each tomahawk cost $1,000,000 (there were 23 of them) what do you
	think the people of Iraq would do if we offered them the money we spent
	on bombing them into submission on the condition that they get rid
	of Saddam?
===============
You're missing the point to some extent.  That would offer Clinton no
show of a "great leader getting tough" which undoubtedly has something
to do with this.  To some extent, this *must be* (again, IMHO) a concession
to the conservative power brokers (read oil, auto, intelligence/military
hardware industries) with whom Clinton must negotiate.  Maybe if they
get to kill enough Iraqis (i.e. sell enough hardware) then the brass'll back 
down and quit fucking with gay people in the services...(nice "froidian
slip", eh?) as a political concession to Clinton, who will then look good to
the American people and get re-elected!!!

To make a long story short, I DON'T think you can take this stuff at face
value, there's just too much involved...


next
-----------------
8) How many people do you kill to force a leader of a country to
	behave?
==========

As many as it takes to upset his power base (I woulda said his/her, but the
only woman I can think of who would behave like that is Margaret Thatcher)
which in Hussein's case is VERY MANY, if not all of them...

------------
9) Why are we bombing Bagdahd and not Capetown, or Bejing?
=============
*Silly*, they're *our* busi(ck)ness partners, we can't bomb *them*.
See when you and someone else are making $$$ together, you don't bomb 'em
cuz it looks bad at the staff meeting monday morning, and they'll be pissed
that you bombed their daughter out of her bedroom, etc and the morning
staff meeting will get all fucked up, and maybe have to be re-scheduled.
Now, if someone else gets in the market and starts taking your business,
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET THE BOMBS OUT, GET ME?  just kidding....sort of....
but I really don't think that this (minus all the sarcasm...) is all *that*
far from the truth...ever since the 70's the oil boys have been crying
about those damn middle-easterners wanting to control "our" oil...
even if it is in *their* country.


-----------
10) How do you feel about the "United Nations" undertaking so many
military adventures lately?
==========
in a word?  shitty.

-----------
11) Does violence really solve anything?
============
It can give you long lasting emotional scars...makes some nitwits
"feel like a man" {irish accent: "but *I* like it too!"  PS: i'm
irish, so don't even start, just keep having this TV jingle
mentality today}


12) If you look at the experiences we have in raving, can any of these
insights be applied on a Global Level?
===============
probably, the whole idea of spreading the vibe certainly won't hurt...
building coalitions and *business* relationships that are strong enuff
not to be maligned by "official efforts" etc. don't hurt either.  basically
this is like the War On Raving (tm) that has been going on here, but on a
global level...so since you have a gift with cops, maybe we should find
out if that gift translates to government and international business....
or there's always the Kesey method....

Well howard I don't consider myself a pacifist (although I find myself leaning
more and more that way) On this issue you might like to read
Starhawk's New book ... the Fifth Sacred Thing.  It's kind of sappy
in the beginning but get's really good and deals with the question of
violence and countering it with MASSIVE, ORGANIZED non-violent civil
dissobiediance.  You might say well the agressor will just kill people,
this is true, but people die in any war. How many soldiers do you know 
who can continueously shoot humdreds of people who are not fighting back
even if ordered... when do you draw the line.  I often wonder whether
the bombidear could push the button if he could see just one young
mother with a new born in her arms on his targeting CRT instead of just
a faceless building.

I don't know cuz I wasn't there but I hear that a lot of the troops
were freaking out at the "battle " allong the highway out of Kuwait
because the "4th largest army" was basically a sitting duck and absolutely
no match of the US, to such a point that even Collin Powell thought
to "carry on" would be bordering on a war crime rather than an engagement.

This is not a flame, I'm just trying to figure out for myself when
(if ever) is violence a necessary response.

I think what Monica was getting at was gender-neutral language such as:

None, of course... however, as you point out here:

That's the whole thing.  Artillery and bombers have no direct
interaction with the targets they destroy.  This is why it's easy for
citizens of countries like this to support things like panama or
Desert Storm...  they never see the results of bombings etc.  

Fighter-bomber pilots suffer from the same distancing from the effects
of their weapons.

If there was a large scale passive resistance in a war zone, I fear it
would end up a slaughter.  Lots of people died at Tianamen and in the
Baltic states in such efforts (bravely too... I would never try to
demean such sacrifice) and those weren't in a war zone.  

If the US Army came up against a passive resistance, it would just pass by it,
leaving a small unit to watch it.  There is not much threat in leaving
a peaceful protest behind your lines :-)
There's even a branch of the army devoted to dealing with such things,
to make sure people got fed etc...

HOWEVER, if there was a large scale passive resistance between two
aggressors, or in the vicinity of a major bombing target, no one would
be around to see the faces of the victims.  That's where the above
problem manifests.

The place large-scale protests are most effective are at home when
troops are overseas in some shithole where they shouldn't be.  But we
already know that :-)

> I don't know cuz I wasn't there but I hear that a lot of the troops

Luckily I got to sit it out at Ft. Bragg (I was in PSYOP school) but I
got to talk with quite a few of the guys in the 82nd when they came
back.  Plus all the UN troops and Special Forces at Bragg (being in
a special ops school at the time gave me a lot of unique perspectives
on the event, to say the least...)

For the most part they were just glad to be back... I got to see some
pictures, though, and the 'highway of death' is definantly in the
above category... it was far worse than let on by the media.

Gee, what a politically expedient thing to say.  I guess that's why
he's a General.  I wonder how he... oh nevermind.  Far be it from me
to criticize superior officers <:)

HI FOLKS, 
Just time for my $.02 here on all htis bombing stuff.

It just seems to me that as usual we try to pump up the average joe with
sports related stuff, and while we have that adreneline rush going, 
show how we are bombing the hell out of something. Anyone who has been
in 5th grade knows that feeling of rush you get when everything is happening, and you dont quite understand it but it ' has ' to me good....
* Sigh * 
You see my point ? To quote ....

 " Weve got college kids so interested in beer we could put a nuclear

So basically I think ( hope ) that we as a nation are coming out of this
numbing trance of Everything is ok, All is well... and seeing fro real whats
going on in the world around us, and how the people we sent to represent us are simply not doing that. When was teh last election that you can remember when it was a choice between the better of the two, and not the lesser of the two evils
Im not trying to say that everythign in inherently bad, but that we have to 
kinda buck up, and grab the reins, take the country off of political 
auto pilot, and take control again using the methods established 
that are nonviolent. And when those fail ( IE : rodney King ) Then take 
more steps. And more. But IMHO, and IMHO only, violence is, if not
the absolute thing Not to do, cartianly not much better than what 
is being done in the first place. 

Ok, so maybe Im sounding too 60s' and hippy-like. Im not intending too, 
I mean that was a wonderfull time and all, but Kent state proved
that the whole thing needed some slight revamping. At the very least, we can band togeteer, those of us who are like minded, and want to see a way out of this turmoil that we are in, and instead of fighting the others that oppose , work inside to 
strengthen and reenforce each other ... to enpower each person next to us, 
and feel a true honest flow of if not unity, then something close to it, 
where we have a common denomator that is universal. WE will not ever agree with each other 100%. Its not in our nature to.... however it it is LEARNED, not developed naturally, to hate the others that dont agree with us, and feel the need to Wipe them out

when I was young, I grew up in a remote part of vermont. WE had one ( Please forgive, all you silly PC people ) black kid in thwe whole school. I swear, not a single person looked/talked/acted any differently towards him. ( Exxcept that he never
recieved any arguement aobut wanting to play lando caliercian when we played star wars at recess :) 

The point is, it is POSSIBLE for us to not all agree, to not all have a singe 
( Single ) Ideal way... but to coexist in toleration. We just need to learn it, 
the same way we learned how to hate... only this time we can smile.

Take a good hard look. What matters to us. What REALLY matters ?
I mean that 9 to 5 job thats sucking your life away wont do you 
any good in 50 years.... those worries about your status, your car your 
ability to be better than the next guy so you can step on his head on the way to the top of the ladder....

Heres a hint. Climb the ladder, only to find a diving board at the top, and
when you jump, if you are lucky the last thing you will see is binky the clown
pulling away the glass of water, leaving you to contemplate the cement.

On the other hand, oter things are lasting. The memory of work monday will
be gone from you before the week is out... but.... that sunset you took in 
last month, you know, the one after swimming in the ocean all day ? That will be there next week, next month, next.... and when you are 50.... will you 
want to remember 200 days a year in a cuibicle, or the time you spent 
getting poision ivy having sex in the woods ?

There is a balance. We work to sustain ourselves, but we need to do things
to make it worth while to sustain ourselves. To enjoy ourselves.. to make
something of this life other than work strife and pain. Is it
me or do some people just lash out at others who are happy with themselves
because they have failed to achieve this balance? A friend of mine was taling aobut his degree in economics and how he was going to new yourk to work in a brokerage frim and how wonderfull that is... and I laughed and said " Thats cool, 
Im going to california to do whatever. " And he could not believe I was ' so stupid ' .. but you know what ? Hes in NYC right now miserable as a bastard, chained to a desk, and Im working ( Working ? ) part time, and spending my afternoons 
In the sun. You tell me who is living to exist, and existing to live.

( Strictly IMHO, this does not apply to everyone, just as I see it )

But Ill tell you what, when the stock market crashes, you wont see me
diving out the 40th story window. 

Buildings crumble, governments tumble, cars break down, video games break :)
But the woods are always there. 

Just my ranting, as you can see I jump topics alot :) and I dont exactly have a masters degree in spelling, but Thanks for taking the time to read this.

when I was young, I grew up in a remote part of vermont. WE had one ( Please forgive, all you silly PC people ) black kid in thwe whole school. I swear, not a single person looked/talked/acted any differently towards him. ( Exxcept that he never
recieved any arguement aobut wanting to play lando caliercian when we played star wars at recess :) 

The point is, it is POSSIBLE for us to not all agree, to not all have a singe

the same way we learned how to hate... only this time we can smile.

Take a good hard look. What matters to us. What REALLY matters ?
I mean that 9 to 5 job thats sucking your life away wont do you 
any good in 50 years.... those worries about your status, your car your 
ability to be better than the next guy so you can step on his head on the way to the top of the ladder....

Heres a hint. Climb the ladder, only to find a diving board at the top, and
when you jump, if you are lucky the last thing you will see is binky the clown
pulling away the glass of water, leaving you to contemplate the cement.

On the other hand, oter things are lasting. The memory of work monday will
be gone from you before the week is out... but.... that sunset you took in 
last month, you know, the one after swimming in the ocean all day ? That will be there next week, next month, next.... and when you are 50.... will you 
want to remember 200 days a year in a cuibicle, or the time you spent 
getting poision ivy having sex in the woods ?

There is a balance. We work to sustain ourselves, but we need to do things
to make it worth while to sustain ourselves. To enjoy ourselves.. to make
something of this life other than work strife and pain. Is it
me or do some people just lash out at others who are happy with themselves
because they have failed to achieve this balance? A friend of mine was taling aobut his degree in economics and how he was going to new yourk to work in a brokerage frim and how wonderfull that is... and I laughed and said " Thats cool, 
Im going to california to do whatever. " And he could not believe I was ' so stupid ' .. but you know what ? Hes in NYC right now miserable as a bastard, chained to a desk, and Im working ( Working ? ) part time, and spending my afternoons

Subject: Re: Terrorism

        First, apologies to all who joined the list to hear about raves...
I actually am enjoying this thread, coz it shows that we are a collective 
of people who have deep thoughts on a lot of these things, but it's straying
farther and farther away from the charter... but whatever, no one's unsubb'd
yet because of it so I'm cool, as long as it doesn't get much larger than it
is.

        Now a few thoughts about all this.  (I sent a point-by-point response
personally to Geoff, but he replied basically that I was naive, so I'll spare
you all the gore)  I also thought Geoff's questions were so laced with
innuendo that answering them directly would be silly - almost like that 
question, "So, have you stopped beating your wife?".  

	State-sponsored assassinations are *illegal*, by the Geneva 
Conventions adopted shortly after World War 2.  (I *think*, I may be wrong
but I'm maybe 75% sure and don't have the resources to check this.  Please
correct me).  For the United States, or Iraq, or any country to adopt this
as a policy, either explicit or covert, is something that should be matched
with harsh world-wide scorn and be considered an act of war against the 
other country.  The United States has never explicitly made assassination
a military option.  We attempted to assist local revolutionaries all over the
world, sure, but there's a difference between that and sending a cruise missile
to knock at the door of a dictator.  This fact is frustrating to many, because
many rightly feel that had Saddam been taken out early the Gulf war and this
would have possibly never happened.  

	But no matter how evil Bush was, and I agree he was evil, he DIDN'T
deserve to die by assassination.  Hopefully our society has progressed, or
will progress, to the point where we can use the tools of technology to make
democracy TRUELY become an instrument of the people.  This will be the true
revolution, the true grass-roots movement, not from outsiders dropping bombs
on civilians, but from the inside.  Thus, I do not anticipate any sort of 
violent revolution to bring about massive change, the change will come from
within.  Clinton is a first sign of this, and maybe he's not perfect but he's
a really good start.

	So getting back to the question, was this "justified"?  Yes and no.

	*IF* it was prooved with sufficient evidence that the Iraqis had 
established a strong enough program to instigate acts of violence in American
soil, and *IF* it could be prooved that these government buildings were in
fact the headquarters for this operation, and *IF* it could be prooved that
eliminating these headquarters would be sufficient to wipeout a substantial
portion of that threat, then it was justified.  Do we have the moral authority?
Yes, in the same way we had the moral authority to confront Cuba and Russia
during the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 60's.  Now, these "IF"'s are really
only things that the CIA and the military would be able to answer, so I am
not going to make a judgement on it.  I perhaps feel the military is less
apt to fire missiles any chance it gets, that it would take something fairly
serious for it to recommend direct action, if only because they are having a
budget squeeze and only in our wildest dreams are military men actually hot
to get into a battle or war.

	On the other hand, the military and the Clinton administration has
decided to play judge, jury, and executioner in this case, rather than await
the verdict of the trial of those 14 men recently arrested in New York (and
isn't there a World Court case proceeding on this?)  What would have been
ideal is if the US had presented this to the UN and awaited approval, or
even given an ultimatum to Iraq the way Kennedy gave Krushchev a chance to
back out.  And yes, this sends a "message", but we need to do more than 
symbolic actions to cause any real change.


	As Howard noted, we can't allow ourselves to be lulled into a false
sense of security.  Geoff, I sincerely wish we would be able to reach out to
Iraq and use nonviolent means to counter what's happening.  The oil embargo
is perhaps one way the US hopes to do that (though it's not very effective,
since it only exacerbates the gap between rich and poor).  However, mankind
has not progressed to the point where everyone understands the symbols that
peaceful people use when they have differences.  And the money factor can 
have the effect of debasing people as well.  It's very sad to say, but some-
times the only thing aggressive people understand is aggression, and while
on the personal level it may be conquerable, when you're dealing with nations
it's a lot harder.  I would *LOVE* to see the military harness our phasar
beams of pure love.... but until the human species has evolved a little bit
more, we're still not much more than animals when it comes to protecting our
self interest.  Perhaps the rave mentality is part of that evolution, and
those of us who have gone through that experience will never again believe
war can solve anything.  But as long as there are people out there who do
believe that, and who are willing to kill you because they do, you shouldn't
give them the chance.

We need to evolve as a species, that's for damn sure.  "The Vibe" is a 
start...

Subject: Terrorism, Raves, etc.


The whole idea of 'intervention' (read: violence) in another country
in order to prevent 'terrorism' (read: violence) is flawed on a deep level.
It rests not only on the moral assumption that we _can_ positively 
affect people's desires and actions in this way (what would you do 
different if Zaire threatened to carpet-bomb us if anti-black violence
did not decrease?), but that we should even consider it.  The same
justifications are used to bust raves: "We are coercing you for your
own good."  "But maybe we _want_ to do this!"  "No sane person would
_want_ to go into hypnotic trances, damage their hearing, ingest dangerous
druuuuugs; these things are dangerous, therefore we will protect you
from them."

It's sad to watch people killing each other for dumb reasons, but our
violence will never help the situation.  At best, some people will be
subdued, and their resentments fester.  At worst, we spent a lot of money
to kill a lot of people who might not otherwise be dead.  Let's clean
our own nest first.

Something Maureen said prompted this little spiel.

Most people who smoke cigarettes seem to think that the world is their
ashtray.  Even among the more "politically aware" types I know that
smoke, the usual habit is just to drop the smoldering butt on the ground.
It REALLY HONKS ME OFF to see piles of little brown trash EVERYWHERE
I go, especially since most of those filters are fiberglass and aren't
going to break down any time during the current geological age.  Would
you throw your candy wrapper or juice bottle in the dirt behind you as
you walk?  No, you wouldn't, unless you're an utter yotz.  Yet many
people who would rightly be pissed off at such behavior routinely flick
their spent cigs to the ground.

Stomping them out doesn't help.  It just makes them kinda flat.

I know it sounds kind of disgusting to have to keep your dead butts with
you until you can find someplace to throw them away.  Well, they're no
less disgusting on the ground.  Take responsibility for your waste
products, people.

I know most people on this list don't smoke.  I'm not anti-smokers, just
anti-trash.  If you see a friend dropping butts on the ground, tell them
to pick it up and shape up.

This rant was also prompted by seeing the Solstice areas afterwards.  
Beautiful natural areas, relatively unspoiled by people, and impossible-
to-pick-up little trash bits all over them. 

I hope I haven't bummed everyone out by the tone, but since we were 
talking about leaving areas clean and/or unspoiled, I had to get this
off my chest.  Besides, that's what the area between the plastic and the
paper is for, unless you're one of those weenies that gets hard packs.

This is what I'm afraid of.  Majority rule is only as good as the
majority.  Think how fickle and unreasonable majorities are (read any
polls lately?).  All tools will do is make the majority more fickle
and more quickly swayed.

I don't trust 'movements' since their aim is almost always to get power
for the people in the movement from those currently wielding it.
Other than that, I agree.

When you choose the lesser of two evils, you have still chosen evil.

Who cares?  The probability of my being killed by an Iraqi terrorist is
roughly equivalent to the probability of my being hit by a falling 
meteorite.  If the US government didn't exist (by now you've probably
noticed the anarchist slant here) they'd have no reason to bomb us at all
and the probability would vanish to near zero.

Go ahead!  Proportionally you should spend 70% of your worry time 
worrying about getting in a car wreck and .001% worrying about being
the victim of a terrorist attack.  The more we react to terrorism, the
better it works.  Q.E.D.

We never will be.  We are animals.  Accept this, and find out what we
can do with this incredible energy instead of denying that it exists.
The conflicts we get are short-term self-interest (example: cheap air
conditioning) versus long-term (no ozone layer = skin cancer, death).
Get enough information to understand the long view and self-interest
works for your long-term good (and often others', too).

  Perhaps the rave mentality is part of that evolution, and

Unassisted physical evolution takes millenia upon millenia.  Besides, 
evolution is a tautology: the fittest survive because they are the fittest
AT THAT TIME.  No thought to the future.  Therefore, faster evolution 
will result in humans that dominate the planet even more thoroughly than
before.  How to stop this?  Show people that having fun is better
than not having fun by enjoying yourself continuously.  Live a stranger 
and more intense life.  Rave harder, love deeper.  One example is worth
one thousand self-help books and political discussions.  "The Vibe".

If you think of raves as an escape from daily life you're missing 
an important lesson.  Reality is only boring because we've let it
be boring.

Fun stuff to read:
Bob Black, "The Abolition of Work and Other Essays."
-Read this.  Now.  I promise you'll laugh hard and think a lot.

Marshall Sahlins, "The Original Affluent Society"
-I forget where this essay is first printed/reprinted.  Try the Zerowork
 anthology from Autonomedia.

OK, I'm down off the soapbox.  Sometimes I feel this strange need to

Subject: Beyond the Infinite Rave (was Terrorism


As long as there exists more than 1 mind, there will exist a difference of 
perspective and therefore, some degree of disagreement.  Where there is
diversity, there will be conflict.

But when separate minds become aware of, communicate with, and connect to 
one another, there must be a convergance of perspective, some degree of
agreement.  Where there is communication, there will be harmony.

The paradox of maintaining-diversity-while-promoting-unity is evident
in the microcosm of the Rave.  Much of the magic of raving is the coming
together of separate consciousnessess through music & dance.

But what would happen if the Rave never ended?  How "together" would we 
become and what happens when we can't come "together" any further?  If we
all became One, how much fun would it be to rave alone?

i agree (except i would say that although it shouldnt be,
master is probably a gender oriented term - master/mistress)
that that is what monica was saying

but i was NOT being sarcastic in the least,
i think the FAQ should use only female nouns and pronouns

Just one thing (after this I'll go to email if people want to talk about it)

One of the arguments _for_ democracy is that democracies don't go to war.  That
is, of course, if the process is treated democratically.  This is just another
example of the circumventing of the process established by our founding fathers
designed to _prevent_ this.  Do it on a weekend.  Don't tell anyone.  Let them
applaud afterward.  Then let it blow over.  It's a very cynical view of the
body politic, one which is reinforced by the overall apathy of the American
people to the situation in Iraq.

To countervail this trend, we need two things; community and communication. 
Rave culture provides the former, the Internet, the latter.   Hmmmm.....  
Maybe we're onto something here.....

Chris,

I immediately thought of forwarding this excerpt to president@whitehouse.gov
and vice-president@whitehouse.gov, but don't want to do so without your
permission, what do you think?

The reason I would like to do this is because of the discussion currently
going on about encryption and the supposed "need" for police & security
agencies to have access to the text of encrypted  communications.
  Obviously the authors of the new Russian constitution are more concerned
about personal liberty than our own government and related agencies...

Let me know if this is ok, ok?

Ok...

I have a lot of feelings about this issue, in fact too many to go into right
now but another fact that I heard a couple of weeks ago was that the supposed
assasins were caught with drugs on them.  How many of you think it is very
likely that proffesional assasans on a top-secret mission to kill bush for
Iraq would be dumb enough to carry drugs on them?  I believe this had something
to do with their getting caught too.

Actually, I disagree. Master can be used for either male or female if it
pertains to a particualar skill. e.g. She is a Master Chef. (Ever hear of
a Mistress Chef?) Mistress also infers marriage. Mrs. is the abreviation for
Mistress. Master <verb> means to bring under control, to direct, etc. Which
is what a DJ DOES at a rave. Don't get me wrong. I'm on your side, I'm just
pointing out that master as used in the FAQ would remain gender unspecific.

I kinda find that strange. Why exclude the use of gender unspecific
pronouns in favor of either male or female pronounce only? It would appear
that in either you would be excluding SOMEONE.

I have to agree with this guy. I don't think people should be

I basically respect everyone, so elders automatically get my respect.
But I won't automatically think someone old is wise, or that I should
especially take heed of what they say. There's a saying that goes:

"In 20 years a person may gain 20 years experience, or may gain
one years experience 20 times." I've seen some very wise old people,

Well, if net.behavior is any indication of "communication promoting harmony" I 
disagree . . . witness the daily Internet flame wars as evidence.  Whenever 
people feel comfortable enough to really communicate, to really share what 
they have to say, it's going to annoy some other people and cause stress.  
(Such as in the case of what I am writing right now.)  The key to harmony 
isn't merely communication, but COMMUNICATION + RESPECT on the parts of the 
speakers and listeners.  And Lee, I totally respect what you are saying, and
am glad that you have bridged the terrorism discussion back to raving and
its mission to spread light (both as in "contrast to darkness" as in 
"contrast to heaviness") in the world.

>But what would happen if the Rave never ended?  How "together" would we

>all became One, how much fun would it be to rave alone?

The East Coast Rave Scene (tm??  ha ha ha) is much younger both chronologically
and spiritually than what you have out West it seems.  So anything I say is
going to be based on my experiences out East.  But anyway, I really and 
truly feel that TOO MUCH "together" flattens everything out, and engenders a
sort of sheep / group mentality . . . and in me, that sort of thing breeds
strong contempt toward those who I view as "sheep."  Okay, so I'm being nasty
here, but this is what I see.

I guess what I really believe is that there are like two levels to the whole
peace/love/unity/respect thing, and that people have to get it straight on
BOTH levels for the whole global-rave-culture-thing to take place.  Out here
it is often the case that people think you have to be luvvy duvvy agreeing
on everything and cuddly huggy to be "truly" peaceful, loving, unified, and
respectful.  That's the "sheep thing" to me.  They understand that if people
were more peaceful etc as individuals, they can spread a new way of looking
at the world on, but they seem to miss the point on how to deal with this
personal level in a mature way.  Some people don't comprehend how I can
love and respect someone while at the same time admitting that they totally
cheeze me off and that I'd rather not be friends with them in the "let's
chat every time I see you and hang out together" sort of way.  In the past
few months I'm seeing things "grow up" out here, so don't think I've given
up on it here, because I haven't -- not one tiny bit.

Was this a digression?  Maybe I should just shut up . . . :-)

What I'm getting at is that I feel that if we all became One there wouldn't
be a point to even existing any more.  I like that there is a boundary between
me and the rest of the world, because then I can control what gets to me.
And it's the same way with countries and their spheres of influence, and any
other type of group like that.  For my part, however, I must take it upon
myself to be generous (a form of love and unity) to people who seek to cross,
and in return be peaceful and respectful when I seek to cross someone else's
borders.  This attitude covers everything from me being polite when I ask 
someone for information, to nations relaxing trade and immigration 
restrictions.

This is what we need to spread.

Love and community,

Laura

  Unfortunately.  Most women DJs I know do, on average, better sets
than men DJs and have less egos to boot.  I think using 'she', 'her',
or even 'queen' drives the point home that DJs don't have to be male
and makes people think.  We aren't about perpetuating the status quo
are we?

   As for the use of 'they', 'them' or 'their' as singular pronouns, I
am highly supportive of it.  And I was very happy to read that writers
are starting to support this usage as well.

   If you will excuse my indulgence...here's an excerpt from a Grammar
Footnote in the job hunting guide "What Color Is Your Parachute?" by
Richard Nelson Bolles:

     Throughout this book, I often use the apparently plural pronoun
     "they," "them," or "their" with singular verbs or
     antecedents--such as, "You must approach _s_o_m_e_o_n_e for a job and
     tell _t_h_e_m what you can do."  This sounds strange and even wrong
     to those who know English well.  To be sure, we all know that
     there is another pronoun -- "you" -- that may be either singular
     or plural, but few of us realize that the pronoun "they," "them,"
     or "their" was also once treated as both plural and singular in
     the English language.  The latter usage changed at a time in
     English history when agreement in number became more important
     than agreement as to sexual gender.  Today, however, our
     priorities are shifting once again.  Now, the distinguishing of
     sexual gender is considered by many to be more important than
     agreement in number.

     The common artifices used for this new priority, such as "s/he,"
     or "he/she," are tortuous and inelegant.  Hence, Casey Miller and
     Kate Swift, in their classic "The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing,
     argue that it is time to bring back the earlier usage of "they,"
     "them," and "their" as both singular and plural -- just as "you"
     is/are.  They further argue that this return to the earlier
     historical usage has already become quite common out on the
     street -- witness a typical sign by the ocean which reads "Anyone
     using this beach after 5 p.m.  does so at their own risk."  I
     have followed Casey and Kate's wise recommendation.

When a cop comes looking around a beach too bad they don't just
leave us alone.  :)

Try stubbing it out on the bottom of your shoe and putting it either
a) between the plastic and the paper, if you have a soft pack, or
b) back in the box, if you have a hard pack.

If you roll your own you can just throw it in a fire.  Don't throw 
pre-made cigs in there, though: fiberglass burns toxic.

If someone lends you one you have to be a bit more careful: either find a
trashcan or hold on to it until later.  Such is the price of accepting
charity.

There's a branch of special operations called Civil Affairs, whose
primary mission is to co-ordinate with a nation's government to
minimize the bad effects of moving large numbers of troops through their
country, and also to help provide an infrastructure to a nation
destroyed by war.  They also co-ordinate things like food distribution
and medical issues for the civilian population while and after the
army is there.  Actually, they'd probably like for there to be large
peaceful protests so that people would be more or less in one place
and not running around getting shot at.

	This was my immediate reaction when I heard of the bombing.
	I didn't see it as a vengence or morality move at all.
	Clinton's popularity has been lagging.
	He picked a target popular with the Amerikkan people.
	He shot some missles at it.
	His administrations called it a "success."
	According to the newspaper article I read his approval rating went
	from 39% to just over 2/3.  Also, his rating for foreign policy handling
	specifically went up as well.  
	Now, was this worth the lives and money?  For Bill, he'd probably say

When you think about it, the difference between conflict and harmony is
probably subjective and moralistically biased:  
Yin&Yang -> Point&counterpoint -> leader&follower -> killer&victim...  
Basically, all we can truly say is that shit happens, shit interacts...  

I think that when we rave, we step out of our respective sewers into a 
simpler subset of reality where the dream of mutual love and respect for
our individuality mixes with a unity of focus that brings us together 
spiritually and emotionally.  *We* see it as an attempt to reach a
harmonious state while others may see it as an act of conflict against 
society and our biological sleep patterns.

It has been theorized that the 
One Mind/God/Omniscience/Universal Consciousness/Ultimate Truth
realized this and out of Absolute Boredom broke itself up into all the 
ignorant perspectives that we see today.  In this scenario, I am "God" in 
an amazingly stupid form, with equally stupid friends who are also "God", 
and we all get to dance with or kill each other, depending upon an infinite 
number of possible circumstances.  It seems that our common goal is either 
to kill each other off until there is only one of us left, or to converge
our perspectives into a completely unified one, at which point the WE/I/It
gets bored again and so starts the process over.

Subject: Re: Virtual

It'd be nice to get specific numbers about the various VR facilities.
I went to a science fiction convention, a medium/small one, where they
had a room with the Mandala environment. At least half the
conventioneers never got to see it because there just wasn't time to
run them all through. I believe they were running it 4 hours at a
time, 8 people per session, 5 minutes per.

I can't wait until helmet rigs get reasonably affordable and
*standardized*. Bring your own, find a socket, and get virtual.
Aaaaah.

I've got the most incredibly wonderful game almost completely designed
in my head. I just have to wait till it's practical for people to
actually play it.

Hey!

I have this idea; maybe it's not a very good one, in which case, I'll
rely on you all to let me know.

Below is a petition I drafted to send to president@whitehouse.gov
and vice-president@whitehouse.gov.

I thought maybe we could "sign our names" and "give our addresses"
just by giving something like:

jocelyn@hal.com (Jocelyn Cordell)

Is this dumb? Anyone want to sign? I'll compile the list of 
signatures if people like the idea.

Oh, yeah- if you don't like what I wrote, please send me
your suggestions- I'm open to changing it.


----------------------------------------------------------------

We do not condone the bombing of Iraqi "intellegence buildings"
that occurred on June 26, 1993. We feel that little to no effort 
was made to find alternate means of "sending a message to Iraq" 
or "teaching Sadam Hussein a lesson" before violent miltary actions 
were taken. We do not appreciate the implications we must bear as 
American citizens as a result of this bombing.

We also seek to remind the Clinton Administration 
that bombs are not "messages;" they are weapons of mass destruction 
that caused the death of eight innocent Iraqi civilians.

Respectfully,

Probably not without suggesting it to the list first.  Those participating
can do it themselves without "dad" intervening.  And maybe not even then,
consenses might think it relevent enough to stay main, and then maybe not.

As a few of you know, Mike W. and I have been working on a little side
project to produce DJ Mix CDs. Well our first offering, 
"Garth: No Rest For the Wicked" is now available. It's a 64 minute set, 
recorded to directly to DAT, and all of the clicks, pops, and other nasty
sounds have been digitally removed, so the sound quality is pretty good.

We're offering a special deal for all of our friends at sfraves. For sfravers 
only, this CD is available for just $10.

If you want a copy, just find one of us and identify yourself. I might have
some copies at Your Sister's House. Both Mike and I will be at the Full Moon
on Friday night and at the Gathering on Saturday night. If you don't know
what we look like, ask around or send mail.

joe wrote and suggested that "master" could be used as it can be
gender-neutral, and pertains to someone with a particular skill ("master
chef") or someone who directs or brings under control....

actually, come to think of it, i don:t like "master" at all becuz of the
hierarchy and power-over i think it implies, at least when it is used in the
controlling sense .... rather than think about a dj having control or
power-OVER me, i would rather think of them as a "digital shaman", (if i am
correct in my understanding of shamanism) or perhaps a priest/ess, who has
power-WITH me through their influence, who aids in summoning my energ-e ...

altho: it is nice to think of letting go and surrendering to the musick, dj,
etc.  ... but i guess that:]s still not the same as the dj having total
control, cuz one chooses whether or not to surrender...

anyway, just verbalizing ....

I just wanted to let you all know that this weekend, actually, thurs,
fri, and sat nights I will be performing in one for the road by 
harold pinter.  it's at the durham studio theatre, 8:00 each night,
and it's free. =)

so if you're in the area, do pop in.  it's an hour long... so it will
give you plenty of time to go out if you do decide to see it.

Subject: This week's RAVE guide

	Howdy gang... 

	This being a 4th of July party and allyou now have *3* nights to
indulge in your dancing pleasure.

	Friday night is a good night to try out some of the weeklies,  
Mission Rock always come very highly rated, and there are a few new upstarts 
which look like they could use some checking-out.  Hoowwwwwllllll.....

	Saturday night, both Let Freedom Rave and To the Head have killer
lineups - To the Head is only $10 so it is definitely worth checking out
if you don't feel like driving as far as Let Freedom is likely to be
(last year it was about an hour out of SF - on the flipside, Let Freedom
will definitely be legal.)

	Sunday the Tilt-a-Whirl afternoon BBAQ sound REALLY grand, I think
I will definitely go to that and stay for the music and dancing.  And the
Freedom thing sounds good too, LOTS of toys to play with (should we have
SFRaves flyers there you think?)


	Brian

Subject: Re: Pyramid Lake July 17th-19th

Ok, time to start over.  Pyramid Lake, the western Shoshone/Paiute
Reservation....

We were originally talking about making certain we take good care of the
land for this party.  I say that we have the capability to leave the land in
better condition then when we arrive.  This means picking up a beer can that
has been weathered by years of exposure...old sunbleached paper, filling in
our tent stake holes when we leave.  And no cig butts!  I went further and
shared a very brief knowledge of Native American customs.  One more time:

(Brief as in summarized)  In picking up the garbage we will be honoring
Mother Earth, and the land that is home to the Shoshone/Paiute Nation.  I
suggest that we show respect and courtesy to the many elders that might
visit this unique, wondrous and loud event on their land.  This is not a
command, but a suggestion.  I am not asking anyone to 'buy into' their
beliefs, their belief systems, but just to be conscious that in many Natigve
American cultures, respect for the elders, the grandmothers and grandfathers
is very important.  I have a feeling that everyone jacked into SFRAVES knows
this already from a heartspace.  There are going to be many teenagers
present, at that age where they sort of 'hate' their parents and 'hate'
being told what to do.  My path is to teach by example.

And another image....sacred hoops of life contain many elements including
rules and laws, such as those that cry out to us to pick up our garbage.
On another direction in that same hoop is a place for chaos and change, the
place for estatic dance and healing...  These portals are here for us, for
our personal transformation. 

If the whole elder thing still isn't clear, email me privately as we all
have much work to do before the event and need to get on with it.

Thanks for listening.   -- Mau

Subject: The NEW empire

All of this talk of who did what to whom and how evil it was/ or how good
it was isn't even getting close to the point of what in my estimation is
really going on.

The FACT is billy c (the prez) needed the ratings, he did the most
expedient thing...bread and circuses.

The FACT is despite any feelings you might have against it, the United
States IS the policeman of the world.  And as soon as we settle into that
role things will eventually get better for all concerned.  This is not to
say that I agree with all the policies etc. etc.  IT is to say that we MUST
act uniformly against non-compliance if we are to stop conflicts, and we
CAN. 

What made the Iraqi deal so insidious is that it was so blatantly filled
with a double-standard.  We attack a "Muslim" state but will not defend
Muslims against naked agression by european agressors.

Here's what we should do...we are already committed to conflicts with Iraq,
we should settle this and move on.  Next is Bosnia...we should settle that
too.  History has shown the those particular people will not get along
unless forced, so force 'em.  We do it all the time, and we're EXPERTS at
it.  Next is Somalia, we do have OIL interest there...same attitude, take
care of business, if you stand in the way, you will suffer the
consequences.  Get along or die, simple and pragmatic.  

Since we live in a time where one terrorist can, through bio-technological
warfare (a few fanatics infected with ANTHRAX is enough to bring THIS USA
to it's knees in a matter of weeks), render us into dark ages, pragmatic
decisions must be made since we are dealing with such rampant illogic.  And
this should not be spared on anyone.  If Israel decides to forget about
certain UN articles, the treatment must be equally swift.  Causing civil
wars within our hemisphere (or for PC purposes, sphere of influence), same
deal.  

This is the point...people must get along, by force if necessary.  Or we
will all die.  If you are one to say "oh, you're getting carried away, we
can negotiate...uh, talk...uh draw up a pice of paper.".  Let me let you in
on something, paper MUST be backed up with force or else it becomes
ineffective.  Starving a people only get's them agrier, bombing them into
submission weakens their resolve.  Did wonders for the Japanese and
Germans.

I am NOT pessimistic, nor a war mongerer.  I would have NEVER said these
things a year ago.  But I look into my sons eyes and know that he can not
only be killed indicriminantly by some looney's bullet, but now he must
consider an enemy he may never see, or does not know.  This is where I draw
the line.  I do not beleive that violence is an ultimate answer, but I also
do not beleive that we as a species have evolved enough to not see violence
as an answer.  And as long as this is the case, and as long as there are
enough people who would randomly kill you or I to make a POLITICAL point,
we have little choice.

I love parties, and love what they represent to humankind as a whole, but
unless you can DOSE the world on a big E ticket, we are in for a bumpy
ride.  Order, at this stage of our human evolution is essential for our
survival as the human race.  Anything less could lead to a catastrophe.  

Remember....now matter how high your love phaser is there is a great
possibility that some kook has his gun set to kill.  The real question is
what do you do when looking down the barrel of a gun?

We ARE the new ROME...at least until humankind becomes civilized.


Peace, by any means necessary!

Contrary to what many of you might believe, I have not particularly been 
influenced by a over abundance of left wing rethoric, if anything, I'm
more of an anarchist (but let's not get into that).  Some of my heros
these days if you put them in a room might have violent reactions to each other.

Blame it on my 7-9 grade social studies teacher, Mr. Codianni, who taught us
the difference between primary, secondary and opinion sources, how to read
them, classify some information when you get it, and form your own opinions.
I learned American History from a history book made up entirely of reprints
of primary and secondary sources (there was no commentary, telling us what the
correct belief was although it could be argued that the selection of sources
may have been biased) anyway starting at grade 4, our teacher went out and
got us all subscriptions to the New York Times (this was a Brooklyn Bed-Stuy
school right after the first 60 riots so there was money around for stuff like 
this.  We went to the UN and sat in the general assembly at least twice a year
(but I can't spell, so maybe she should have kept us in the classroom more :)
no to mention visiting many embassies of other countries.  Well the point
of all of this is that I think certain threads of belief keep surfacing
again and again.  I remember reading some Naxi literature circula 1939 which
stated some of thepoints that you have stated above, basicly that the
Third Rich had a moral duty to be the world's policeman and to bring order
and peace to the globe, this is the war that 90% of the german people were
psyched into supporting, don't let it ever happen again...

Who gave us this right? Who is to say that democracy and free markets
is the correct form of government for the rest of the world. Fact is,
for developing 3rd world nations, communism works far better than free
market economies, especially for yer traditional 3rd-world-country with
97%-poverty and 3%-decadent-wealth. (Take Cuba for example -- despite
Amerikkka's attempts to fuck them over for the last thirty years,
they've managed to achieve a better overall standard of living than
most of their south/central-american and caribbean neighbors, and they
do a better job at public health than the US!).

THat's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of insidiousness. We need
to look back to colonial mismanagement to get the full picture of what
is going on there now. We also need to look at our previous attempts to
meddle with Iran (propping up the Shah, arming/training his secret
police). And then when Iran went awry, we started doing the exact same
thing with Iraq.

To get along or die, you need not look farther than your own
neighborhood. We have no business meddling with other countries. Bosnia
is a European problem -- let them take care of it themselves. Somalia
is none of our business.  Sending $$$ to the former USSR is none of our
business either. The only reason why the US gives a fuck about these
places is because they want to ensure that eventually, some fat-cats
will be able to go there and safely make a buck (without the natives
getting *too* restless, just properly subjugated and controlled while
we use them as cheap labor and slowly milk them of their vital life
force). 

If there is one place where I'd like to see the "thousand points of
light" principle apply, it's w/r/t foreign aid. We can't afford it
right now, so lets get out -- send that money straight to our inner
cities.   It's my tax money afterall, and I never voted to send it
abroad. (and I'm mighty tired of giving my spare change to all the 
beggars on the street, especially when the governent took away over 1/3
of my earnings last year).
 
What we should be doing is spending the effort/money/time/lives/people on:

(1) Helping ourselves before the revolution happens here. The
revolution is already happening in small ways -- wanton gang violence
in the big cities, drug/gang/warlords that cannot be controlled, a
large and growing segment of the populace is disenfranchised,
unemployed, homeless, hopeless, and despairing. This doesn't only
affect and uplift "them"... it also affects and uplifts "us" and our
ability to live in a civilized, comfortable, affluent, and safe
fashion. 

(2) Weaning ourselves from dependence on foreign oil. (So that we don't
have to continue sucking up to insane 3rd world dictators to ensure
american industrial productivity.) If we spent a fraction of the  money
we spend on our war machine to create a non-petroleum-based energy and
transportation infrastructure in this country -- we wouldn't have to
worry about Iraq, Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or any of those other
countries. 

Of course, this sort of energy independence is only going to happen
over the dead bodies of the American oil conglomerates and their
buddies in the Pentagon and various big aerospace companies.

(3) Instead of building a war machine -- build a
peace/science/technology/education machine that will make us energy
independent, non-polluting, employed, and satisfied. Put money and
effort into curing or helping people with AIDS, Cancer, Heart Disease,
Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, Depression... Helping US citizens lead
cleaner healthier and happier lives will have a far better uplift than
knowing we can beat the shit out of any country that dares to go
against our sanctimonious views on democracy, freedom, etc.

(4) Jobs and Education. People need jobs/careers/lives that they can
feel proud about, to help them get out of the negative feedback loop
they're in. This is the only way we can start cutting down on violence,
crime, drug abuse -- give people hope for the future.

(5) Along the lines of jobs... Bring back massive public works
projects. Build another bridge across the bay. Extend BART to San Jose.
Build a trans-continental network of bullet trains. Build public
housing to get people off the streets. Build schools to educate and
train them.

Currently, this sort of work-fare or welfare is only given to those
that happen to work for the military or american aerospace/military
companies. And ultimately, the fruits of their labor cannot be enjoyed
by the populace. (With the exception of the fabulous TV entertainment
provided by Sunday night news clips of US foreign military
intervention). Naturally, some of you will say there's a trickle-down
effect in terms of economics and technology -- that's a second order
effect, with most of the benefit beaing reaped by those already in
power. Right now we need first aid and first-order effects to cure an
ailing nation.

These programs will cost us lots of money -- that's no problem -- we'll
print more, cuz it's only paper. Along those lines, all this worry
about the deficit is pure hogwash. We've seen plenty of "boom" in the
economy when we were spending freely on the military industrial
complex. Lets keep on doing the same thing, but use it to advance
science, technology, medicine, education and welfare. Crank up the
deficit -- i personally don't care how high the deficit goes as long as
the moneys are used for good purposes, and falls equally into the hands
of all. All this talk about "leaving debt for our children" is
political hooey -- they'd probably rather see debt than chaos and 
hooliganism.

So lets spend that money at home, on achievements for ALL OF US that
can make us feel proud of our country and proud of our government. 
There's nothing more powerful than the feeling that we're all working
for a winning team! Uplift! Elevate!

If we are the new Rome, then we're setting ourselves up for a fall. 
The former soviet union was the last Rome, and look what happened to
them. As far as I'm concerned, if we don't straigten up our act *FAST*,
we're next. 

The state of the world today (esp. the world economy) is the Pyrrhic
"victory" we have achieved against "communism". As far as I'm
concerned, we've all lost in the process.

If any of you have seen me operate at raves with the police or otherwise
you know I try to practice what I preach as far as non violence.  I have
also been a bouncer in a club and have never had to punch anyone.
I did smack a gun out of someone's hand (don't try this at home kiddies)
once and I have restrained people but generally I've never had to resort
to violence.  When I approach the police, I'm calm and I have the attitude
that I haven't done anything wrong, I'm not afraid of them but I won't be
intimidated either, now I always run the risk that I could run into an
ass kicking kind of cop and lucky for me that hasn't happened yet,  I have
looked down the barrel of a gun before.  I concentrate on the person, I look them
in the eye, and I talk to the part of the person that is good.  I address
the part of them that knows what the good or wholesome action is.  Sometimes
this is hard, I must admit that I have a few special "talents" that were taught
to me by some really special people but they are not anything that anyone else
can't learn.  Some people's minds are easy to lead... that's all I'll say.

Let's all get real here.  John is not a Nazi.  No one on this list
supports the idea of a pax imperia under global U.S. control.  

John was most likely being at least somewhat sarcastic.  

For any other discussion on these topics I'm going to e-mail.  Anyone

Full Moon Rituals in Other Cultures

I was talking to Brian and Leah on vrave the other night, and suddenly 
remembered a few things about Thai Buddhism that I thought you all might
be interested in seeing as our FMRs (San Francisco AND New Jersey) are
tomorrow night.

This is quoted, without permission of course, from the Insight Cityguide
for Bangkok.

Present-day Thais practice Theravada Buddhism, also known as Hinayana or
Lesser Vehicle, Buddhism.

Three Thai holidays -- Magha Puja in February, Visakha Puja in May/June, and
Asalaha Puja in July -- occur on full moon nights and celebrate important
events in the Buddha's life.  Buddhists througout Bangkok gather at their 
nearby wat (temple) shortly after dusk to hear special sermons.  They then 
claps their hands together before their faces, their fingers twined about
with flowers, incense sticks, and candles, and as the full moon is rising,
follow the monks in a procession three times around the bot (central building
on the temple grounds).  It is a magical, mystical night, made even more
enjoyable for the visitor by the Thai penchant fo welcoming outsiders'
participation in their ceremonies, helping them with the particulars of
buying candles and lighting incense.

Magha Puja is a public holiday in Bangkok and a Buddhist holiday marking the
spontaneous gathering of 1,200 disciples to hear the Lord Buddha preach.  In
the evening, Thais gather at temples to hear a sermon by the chief monk of
the wat.  Then, when the moon is rising, they place their hands in a praying
position before their faces and, clapsing candles, incense, and flowers in
them, follow the chanting monks around the bot of the wat three times before
placing their candles and incense in trays at the front of the bot.  It is
one of the most solemn and moving ceremonies in Bangkok.

Visakha Puja, a public holiday, commemorates the birth, enlightenment, and 
death of Buddha.  The three things are all said to have happened on the same 
day.  Visakha Puja is celebrated like Magha Puja with a triple circumambulation 
around the temple as the moon is rising.

Asalaha Puja is the third most important Buddhist holiday and marks the
occaison when Buddha preaced to his first five disciples.  It is celebrated
on the full moon night in similar manner to Magha Puja and Visakha Puja.

Happy FMR!!!!

Love and community,

Laura

That's your big assumption right there, that we have some "moral"
obligation to meddle in others' affairs -- for their own good, of course.
Every war in history has been between the good guys and the good guys.
Don't you see this?

I don't want to live in a world that has people like you in power.
"Get along or die?"  I suppose you determine who's "getting along".
Right now, people at raves are not "getting along", and the consequences
are obvious: fear, busts, and rampant commercialism.

Exactly.  Since a small group of people can, in their basement, whip up
something that will destroy civilization as we know it, conventional
techniques of mass destruction have become utterly useless.  Yet these are
the techniques that you're proposing.

And the prospect of seeing your gene-carrier die causes you to be blinded
with rage, wanting to strike out at anything that would harm it.  That's
the way evolution goes, but you're thinking short-term again.  The policing
you propose will only increase the chance that your son will get killed
by a terrorist.  Of course, it's more likely that he'll be struck by 
lightning either way.  If you have to worry about something worry about
drunk drivers or something else that actually could kill him.

We have plenty of choices.  My choice is to try to build a society, starting

No.  Order is what's killing us -- the slow catastrophe that is stifling
us and causing us to commit these insane actions.  How many terrorists
were there among the Native Americans/Australians/Dayaks/etc., for instance?
Terrorists are created by a combination of circumstances that doesn't really
exist in these societies -- a group of people so drastically disenfranchised
that acts of random violence are preferable to normal existence.

True true!!  We can all find our place in the cosmos, sometimes the music
just makes it easier.  But a "facilitator" is all the music is, you still
have to get there yourself.

As a (budding) DJ, I want to say I agree 100% with this statement!  

We have had a REAL problem out East with DJ-Worship.  To the point where
some of the best DJs aren't allowed to be real people any more . . . the
fans get pissed when Dante is having a "quiet mood" night and wants to chill 
rather than being Mr. Social . . . people get annoyed when Onionz is in the
mood to spin acid trance rather than progressive house . . . a top DJ gets
ragged on when he blows a mix because everyone expects him to be perfect . . .
some of the comments that go around the community are pretty weird, in a 
negative sense.  It can get to be a pressure cooker to be on top, I am sure.

I got started spinning because I love the music so much and just wanted to
relate to it in a way other than listening to / dancing to / trancing to it.
I wanted to share what I love with my friends, too.  With DJ-worship this
communal sharing feeling gets converted into a sort of "you give, we take"
sort of thing, which I personally don't like as much because the expectations
that develop out of that are rather intimidating, and because it take the
power away from the people who receive the music.

God I'm getting talkative . . . see you all SOON . . .

Love and community,

Laura

Laura,  If you've made any DJ mix tapes, I would certainly
buy one from you.  If you haven't, you might want to think of
making a few on your own and bring them along.  These things tend 
to get recopied and circulate...good publicity.  There aren't
a lot of DJs around here who specialize in acid/trance or hardcore
That doesn't mean there aren't people who love that stuff.

Not just in the East, laura.  In SF, if you're not a "name", you
can't get a gig.  Yes, one can start your own event (which is what
a lot of people end up doing), but it's the typical conundrum.  You
can't get a gig until you have name recognition, and you can't get
name recognition until you have lots of gigs.

Beyond that, if an event has a "name" DJ, it's guaranteed 500 people;
an event with a DJ no less proficient but no "name" will be lucky
to draw 50.  As far as I'm concerned, I (and any other DJ) am just
a conduit for the music.  I am not a god/goddess/all that is.  And
if the dancers don't like my work, they should replace me.  I don't
have any ego about being maestro of the crowd--i'm not that good,
and I don't want to be. Me, I'm with Laura:  I really dig the music
and want to share some really tasty tracks with friends and
family, with people who don't have the interest, time, and/or
money to do the same.  Put more succinctly, I have access to
some scarce resources that I want to share.

I guess what it all boils down to for me is: I don't completely
agree with the "DJ is the T" -- we are each the T!  DJ's can't
do it without equipment and dancers; dancers can't do it without
DJ and equipment; eqipment can't do it by itself.

bigger profits, which they distribute primarily among its top officers.
you say we are the new rome. well, you are right, in so far as we have also

Lesser Vehicle, Buddhism.

Three Thai holidays -- Magha Puja in February, Visakha Puja in May/June, and
Asalaha Puja in July -- occur on full moon nights and celebrate important
events in the Buddha's life.  Buddhists througout Bangkok gather at their 
nearby wat (temple) shortly after dusk to hear special sermons.  They then 
claps their hands together before their faces, their fingers twined about
with flowers, incense sticks, and candles, and as the full moon is rising,
follow the monks in a procession three times around the bot (central building
on the temple grounds).  It is a magical, mystical night, made even more
enjoyable for the visitor by the Thai penchant fo welcoming outsiders'
participation in their ceremonies, helping them with the particulars of
buying candles and lighting incense.

Magha Puja is a public holiday in Bangkok and a Buddhist holiday marking the
spontaneous gathering of 1,200 disciples to hear the Lord Buddha preach.  In
the evening, Thais gather at temples to hear a sermon by the chief monk of
the wat.  Then, when the moon is rising, they place their hands in a praying
position before their faces and, clapsing candles, incense, and flowers in
them, follow the chanting monks around the bot of the wat three times before
placing their candles and incense in trays at the front of the bot.  It is
one of the most solemn and moving ceremonies in Bangkok.

Visakha Puja, a public holiday, commemorates the birth, enlightenment, and 
death of Buddha.  The three things are all said to have happened on the same 
day.  Visakha Puja is celebrated like Magha Puja with a triple circumambulation

around the temple as the moon is rising.

Asalaha Puja is the third most important Buddhist holiday and marks the
occaison when Buddha preaced to his first five disciples.  It is celebrated
on the full moon night in similar manner to Magha Puja and Visakha Puja.

Happy FMR!!!!

Love and community,

Laura

Okay, given all this I will VASTLY revamp the DJ section of the faq.
I didn't even look at that section this time around because I hadn't

but when 2.1 comes out in a month or so thing's will be different.

Subject: Re:  DJ Worship (was slip into neutral (was rave FAQ))

Laura is totally correct about the totally unrealistic demands of the NE crowds
on DJs. I've been a house junkie since I heard my first underground track on
a college station in the late '70s/early '80s. It used to be that the crowd
expected the DJ to be nothing more than the purveyor of the beat - we let him
or her make the mood, and make us move. If a longer-than-expected dropout
happened, that was OK...if a mix crashed, that was OK, too, because the
beat reappeared and we danced and it didn't matter. Now, everyone and their
mother is a mix-critic. I do deep house and ambient/trance on 2 Hartford-area
college stations, and I put my sets together according to my mood. I've had
callers say stuff like, "What happened? It was so good last week" and etc.
Well, sometimes I want to bang out Extortion and the 49ers, othertimes I 
want to do the new stuff thing... The pressure to play the latest and greatest
is amazing. At least my sets are genre-consistent... And another thing :-) ,
most of these folk don't realize that we buy our own music, and our own gear.
And very few of us are affluent. I spend about $300 a month on music, so that
my nameless and faceless listeners can dig the best music out there. I do it
with no need for other-than-personal satisfaction. Anyway, I am rambling.
I love the dance scene, and am impressed by the fact that white folks (
especially the white boys) have finally realized that dance is freedom and
liberation. For the first 10 years of my involvement in the Hartford/New Haven
dance scene, it was almost an exclusively gay/lesbian/black community, 
because the white alternative crowd rejected House. I always felt that *IF*
they would only open their minds and souls to the beat, they would see a
community united by music. With all of the different races, colors, philosop
etc. in the world, music is one of the few things that we can collectively
enjoy. That's what dance music means to me beyond the beat. Dance on. Harry.

Subject: Re: DJ Worship (was slip into neutral (was rave FAQ)) 


This is getting interesting here... I was just thinking
about how the rave culture differs from the hip-hop culture,
in that there's less emphasis on having the DJ showing off
and doing flashy tricks.  You know there's a hip-hop
competition, that people try and win by playing records
upside down, standing on their head, etc.  In contrast, rave
DJs almost try and fade into the background.  If you don't
go out of your way to keep track of these things, you
wouldn't know who was spinning (it's really easy to miss the
change between DJs).  It can actually be kind of annoying
when DJs start indulging themselves a bit too much and
forget about just doing the job ("let's wake 'em up with
this obnoxious industrial track!  Or I know, let's check
their disco-tolerance!  Or how about reviving this old
top-40 hit!").

So yeah, the "master/king/queen" bit seems a bit strong...
though on some level you have to recognize the importance of
the DJ in working with the crowd, facillitating/coordinating/encouraging
the vibe...

Ok folks, I end up hanging out in a recording studio all day ( Ask Mr baked raindrop ) and I have to admit there is a big thing there. 
	A T T I T U D E 

And it is the most worthless alienaiting thing Ive ever seen.
Attitude, ego, personal achievement over all else....
As far as Ive seen, this is not the goal of the scene.

The music plays, the vibe spreads... the power unleashes and we all become one. 
One large wave of vibe traveling across the omniverse, in sync, moving up and downn and waving with the channels of the cosmos......

Or we can play petty " Im better than you, Im the baddest the most def the real real man/woman king of the dudes so pay me lots of money for letting you use my name "

* Washes mouth out with Industrial strength floor cleaner *

Dont be like others :) be real. 

Human beings, we are. We dont need to step on the heads of everyone.
Let osme raw mewbee Dj take the table, so hes not perfect.. but the crowd looks up and cheers, mabye dances , another DJ jumps up and shows the guy what to do, suddenly we are all in the stream again...and annother one is born.

Just another IMHO ranting :)

Well if you think aobut it, art can be a science, and science can be an art

art = science as in the chemistry of paint, the physics of sculpting, 
	the thermodynamics of jello diving....

Science = art as in.. well go look thru a microscope :) youll get the idea.

So in the omniverse around us, science and qart coexist, its just these silly human beings that seem to think that they are 2 completely seperate things. Kinda strage, really whan you think aobut it :)

Anybody from B-town heading over to YSH this thursday?  I want to go, but
hate the idea of riding BART.  If anyone could hook me with a ride, give a
call to 549-6240.
Last summer, it seemed like every punk rocker from the east coast crashed
at my co-op.  If east coast ravers are into low-class living (couches,
roof-top, or dirty floor sleeping), we have space.  I keep telling my
housemates that ravers are taking over the world (we get more every
semester), so it would be really cool to have a bunch stay here, just ot
make all the non-house music folks even more paranoid :)
If people want copies of the Mother Earth Sound System zine, I have some
left, which I will take with me to YSH on thursday.

peace to your mind in the summertime,
whitsitt

I'll be there tomorrow... and I'll probably be trying to sell C2 tapes
in the parking lot... no idea where I'll be, but I'll be showing up
early and trying to set up somewhere near the box office but towards
101 (in the parking lot with the bungee crane).  Listen for the music
and drop by!

After being trimmed down and moved more than a few times, Solstice finally
came off in a spectacular way on the 18th and 19th of June.

Getting the generator was the biggest problem.  I reserved a 10KW 30 amp
generator a week in advance, and called back the day I needed to pick it up to
verify it was there.  Surprise, surprise, when I arrived, they didn't have the
generator!  After seeing the whole staff run around in a Keystone-like frenzy,
they finally told me they could get one from another yard, but I had to wait
an hour or so.  I went and picked up the sound instead.  Upon returning, I had
to wait another half hour whilst biting my nails over the whole weekend, but
it finally arrived.

Wow, what a generator.  If I could fall in love with a machine, it would be my
Denon first, then this generator.  15KW and quieter than a scooter.  I was
amazed, plus it was only $45 a day to boot.  That combined with our discounted
rate at the sound shop brought our total cost to $200 for the weekend.

I wanted to start both nights at sunset, but getting everyone going was
difficult.  Brian Behlendorf, Eric Pederson, and his friend Rich arrived in
town later in the evening and we hung around casually for a while before
heading up the mountain.  We eventually arrived there at around 10:30.  It was
wonderful having Brian around since he knows what is up with setting up the
sound.  We were able to get going within minutes.  The FM broadcast was
working well, but wasn't going very far.  People said that they could pick it
up a mile away, but it was competing against another station.  I forgot that
Park City had a station on the same frequency, and from up there it could be
picked up.  We were short a cable for the DAT, so we used the radio as a
substitute.  I use a boombox as a monitor, so we just tuned it in and ran the
DAT from the outputs.

Over 200 people showed up over the course of the night.  Two other local DJs
who were supposed to play weren't feeling up to it at that point, so it was
just down to Eric and myself.  However, Eric was feeling very bedraggled from
the drive and lack of sleep, so he spun for about an hour and a half.  Things
were cool with me until the "hardcore" remainder was left over.  I gave them a
really good hardcore set at about 4:00, with some very vicious acid.  Once I
pulled out though, I kept getting more requests for hardcore.  I was getting
tired and I didn't feel like it at all, so I threw on the junkiest stuff I
had.  They just kept shaking and twitching in front of the speakers.  Finally
the sun started to come up and left me with an excuse to go ambient.  We
stopped at 5:30 and pulled off the mountain at about 6:00.  The first night
had gone well, but would people make the 80 mile trek to the second night?

John called me and suggested that I get my dad's motorhome to relax in while
we were out there.  In order to do this, I needed to get someone to drive a
car back from my father's house.  Brian was the only one around, but
unfortunately, his San Francisco driving abilities had not including manual
transmissions.  So Brian drove the motorhome back, verrrry carefully.  Upon
returning, Bryce Ryan called from the airport and told us he was in town.
He'd cashed in on his frequent flyer mileage to hop out for the weekend.  He'd
also brought a stack of his own music as well.  In the afternoon, Brian, Eric,
and Bryce dabbled with my equipment (on the floor of my house) while we waited
to get going.  At about 8:00 we left for the desert, but made the mistake of
going to the grocery store first.  Eric bought enough food for a small army
and we finally headed out for the desert at 8:30.

I finally arrived out there at 10:15.  Travelling via motorhome had taken
longer than I had expected.  We drove down to the site that I had picked a
week earlier and found a group camped nearby.  I went over and talked to them
about what was going to happen.

"Hi, we're going to set up a dance nearby, do you think that will bother you?"

"Do you need a generator to do that?"

"Yes"

"Dig a hole for it, that will make it quieter"

"Well, the generator is on a trailer, and that really isn't a problem.  The
music will be quite audible over here."

"How late do you plan on going?  4:00?"

"No, all night.  I think the main problem will be the amount of people"

"How many do you expect?"

"Well, last night in another spot we had about 200 people."

"This isn't one of those raves is it?"

I laughed and said it was.  A guy queried me about whether or not there would
be LSD there, and he seemed rather intrigued about it.  I said there probably
would be, but it wasn't anything to worry about.  He was almost ready to agree
when his wife piped up and said, "GO! GO FAR AWAY."  Hurmmmm..

So I went scouting for another location.  Eventually we went back to the
entrance, which was better anyway, since it was much easier to find than spots
a mile in.  The terrain was a bit rougher, but there was a very nice flat spot
that worked out very well.  Only about 60 people showed up.  The difference
from the previous night was that everyone stayed until morning.  I think a lot
of people were taken aback by the fact that we were encouraging them to camp
out.

Bryce kicked off the evening with some fun happy house with a lot of groovin'
vocals.  Then a local girl, Daz-E spun one of the best sets I've heard her
do.  She was followed by Shaun, an old friend here, who did a terrific set,
but things started drying up as far as dancing went near the end.  People were
crowding around a nearby campfire for warmth.  John and I put two and two
together and built a campfire over near the dance area.  Immediately people
flocked to it.  IT WAS SO GREAT.  I just grinned and grinned as the entire
crowd went crazy around the flames.  Shaun went nuts and put on some killer
tracks before Eric hit the decks.  Eric kicked off some tribal that felt
fantastic in the open air.  His set grooved hard and ended with a strangely
appropriate track for the desert area, Eon's "Spice".  Finally, around 4:30, I
went on.  The sky was getting gradually lighter and I was able to put on
everything from Julian Cope to Marco Zaffarano to an appreciative crowd.  It
was also nice being able to mix in some of KLF's "Chill Out" with real trains
shooting by on a track one hundred yards away.  I stopped at 6:30, right after
the sun had crested over the horizon.

The most incredible aspect of the whole weekend was the weather.  Although the
report called for clearing skies, I didn't believe it.  I would look out of
the office windows on Friday and see storm clouds on the horizon, but
amazingly enough, it did clear.  In both locations the sky was stunning, but
especially in the desert location.  I haven't seen the milky way like that in
years and you could literally watch the sky for a few minutes and see half a
dozen shooting stars.  Once it was all over, after we returned home on Sunday
afternoon, the clouds returned in force.  It was almost like a window to
heaven had been opened just for us.

John was skeptical of the success of Solstice before the weekend.  He was
almost certain that we'd be busted in some form or another, but the Taste
magic worked once again.  By Sunday morning, he was slobbering to do another
event in the desert.  On top of that, through the sales of glow toys and
donations, we covered our costs.  When we returned the generator on Monday
morning, we were only charged $65, and only two and a half gallons of fuel had
been used!  We're already planning another one for later this summer, and will
probably give plenty of advance warning on the location, so people will be
prepared to camp.  One thing that will definitely not happen again is two
nights in a row.  I was absolutely wasted by Sunday afternoon.  It also
probably discouraged a lot of people from attending the second night.

Thanks to Brian, Eric, Rich, Bryce, and Spiral Death Trap and his friends for
making the trek.  Sorry I didn't get to talk to you more SDT, I didn't realize
it was you until Sunday morning.  Doing another outdoor has freshened my hope
for doing these promotions.  There is definitely a purer element that will
travel a hundred miles or more to dance.  I'll probably do one more warehouse
to clean up the Meat Beat Manifesto debt, but after that, I'm probably going
to stick to doing infrequent open air events.  I hope that everyone who was
unable to make it this year will make it out next year, you really missed an
incredible time.

The pool party you mentioned, called "Glug Glug", is on Sunday afternoons.
The first one was this weekend, at the Oasis in SF.  Did anyone go?  How
was it?  Scott Hardkiss was real excited about it Thursday night when I
saw him at YSH.  How were the other parties this weekend, too?  [hint: we
need more reviews of weekends on sfraves :)]

Solstice was GREAT, I'll reply to Pete's post about the weekend very soon...

Reply-To: boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com


After calling the (415) Total Devotion number a few times and never
getting directions, I headed to UFO, which was at the One Step.  I had
been there the previous week for Vortex, and I was curious to see what
another promoter would do... also, I wanted to try to sell some more
C2 tapes.

The promoter was nice and let me set up a table near the entrance,
which was cool.

They only had the big main room, the room which was chill for Vortex,
and not the back room, where the main floor was for Vortex.

Unfortunately, there was a band playing in the back room until around
midnight, and they were loud enough that they were drowning out the
PA.  This really bothered a good number of the early-birds, many of
which left.

Once the band quit, things got better, but the crowd never jelled.
I'd say the maximum was 20-30 people dancing, with a good number of
people sitting around and watching.  Carlos picked things up at 1:30
with a great set.  The visuals were OK, nothing spectacular.  (Vortex
visuals were an order of magnitude better...)

I left at 3:15 when the next DJ came on and proceeded to crank the PA
to the point of distortion and pain.

Not a bad effort, but don't EVER rent out one room at the One Step if
there's going to be another event in the other room, there's no noise
isolation.

Interesting note: the security was very mellow, and the One Step
people there were friendly.  Maybe they're starting to realize that if
they make OSB a good place to throw an event, there'll be more events
there.

i am most likely putting out another cd this summer  called "galaxies 2:
(and then some cool subtitle.. perhaps "technospiritual ambience").

what i'm writing about is that i would like to send this open invitation
to you all to participate in the music.

if you are interested in being on the cd send me tracks for 
consideration.
the tracks must be ambient/housey/acid/trance....that is the direction of 
the ENTIE cd.

we are also going to put out a vinyl EP of this... probably 4 songs frm 
the cd will appear on the vinyl.  if you are interested in being on the 
vinyl, sd us REMIXES of your songs... because the vinyl will consist of 
REMIXES of songs from the cd.  only 4 songs will be chosen.

the label's address:

havoc music
po box 1327
ny, ny  10113-1327

work hard and make a KILLER track or two.  deadline is sometime around
august...

also, can someone forward this message to dc-raves?  i don't know that 
address..and perhaps sf-raves too...

more notes:

- the track can be of any length
- cassettes are fine for demo purposes, WELL PRODUCED dat's are required 
if we take your song..


thanks!

get to work :)

Subject: Wickend Report


Thursday:  Your Sister's House, as has already been reported, was
a fun and friendly scene, with that special YSH family spirit.  Shoban
continues to impress me with her song selection & general DJing
capabilities.  I had once feared that female DJs would lean towards the 
lower energy levels of Deep House or the more emotionally overbearing Diva
stuff.  Wrong: Another sexist stereotype has been obliterated from my 
programming.  Most of the stuff played while I was there was a great
mix of trance, some breakbeat, interesting mixes of ethnic and lot's
of fresh high energy stuff that I've never heard before.  Yum.  I wish
I could go to all YSH parties, but I'm starting to run out of excuses
for coming in late, or leaving work early every fryday.

Friday: Recharged my Raveready Batteries for...

Saturday: WICKED - The Stone was supposed to let us in at 1, but it took
until about 2 before early R&R crowd cleared out.  I guess that Morticia,
the band that played, was so great that they were called back for an hour's
worth of encores.  Sorry I missed them - Not.  The same thing happened when
Channeling was here last month - the lesson has been learned.

I was informed at the door that I wasn't allowed to bring my water inside.
"Why not?"  "Because it isn't allowed."  OK, sure, no problem.  Bouncer
turns toward the next in line and I proceed to enter with my water: A 
successful nonviolent act of civil disobedience.  But I had little
time to bask in the glory of this major victory against the forces of 
oppression as Jeno hit the tables full blast to kickoff an evening of 
nonstop  high intensity music.  Markie followed with a spirited and  trancey 
set   that slacked off a little near the end, setting up Garth who took the
remaining faithful into the stratosphere.  It turned out to be a great 
night; 5 hours of nonstop dancing. The crowd was mixed, not as energetic as 
they should of been, but no attitudes either.   I lot of Wicked regulars 
were not there and  the only SFRavers I saw were Chris Hart and Fred Huette.  
It never got too crowded or hot, and I had a much better time than at the
Sweat Factory  at the last Wicked. I guess the Stone doesn't have the 
greatest  reputation, but I usually have a pretty good time every time I go 
there. 

Sunday: Boogie Buffet was fun as usual.  Nice to see Bob Jesse and Ravi,
but where was everyone else this weekend?  I can't believe everyone went
to Devotion out in...wherever the hell it was. 

Up next: Xochipilli!  This should be a magical event for those who seek to 
celebrate the spiritual side of molecular biology.

From: doom@leland.Stanford.EDU


Well, other obligations have been cutting into my raving
time of late, but this Friday I went up to the city to catch
"The Gits" (one of the vanishingly few *good* punk bands) at
the _Bottom of the Hill_, but I didn't hang there long
because their security was a little too hardcore on checking
IDs to let my 18 year old friend in.

Went over to Mission Rock, for the first time (at last) and
found that the place lived up to it's reviews... I don't
know why, but for a long time I expected the place would be
kind of grungy or something, but it's actually a pretty nice
environment, dancing out doors on the the deck by the bay.
They need to learn the art of vibration insulation though.
I'd recommend piling the DJs table with cinder blocks and
putting pillows under the turntables.

Gavin was spinning while I was there (with Garth providing
moral support, dancing behind the tables).  I really liked
some of the stuff he played... the acid jazz was good, the
funkier stuff was okay (though he took it too far over to
disco for my tastes a few times) but what I really don't
understand was his oldies revivals.  He played "White Lines"
and David Bowie's "Golden Years" (screwed up the exit from
Golden Years, too) for an audience old enough to have been
bored by them long ago.  Nostalgia is evil.  Resist.

Problems with the pool??  I'll say...
I went to Splash Saturday morning and they had the pool open.  Someone 
said the pool was clean the previous week, but Saturday the pool looked
like it had been used as a toilet (That's just being nice.  I could get
worst in describing it).

Music, as usual, was good.

My weekend as an "alumnus" raver was great.

We went (We=Zak,Mark and I) drove out almost 100 miles to go near Modesto
to this place....very far....very very very far..but worth it!!

Outside space was great, the energy was wierd but good for the most part,
and despite the 5 numbers, only about 300 people showed up.  Good size.
Great space...campgrounds with waaay too much weedy stuff on the ground,
but it was near a river that was really pretty at dawn....GREAT lasers
(this laser was at groove kitchen a while back) bouncing off of mirrors
into space, on trees, etc....fantastic.  
lame parts: $2 water, people selling BEER (!!!!!), dusty messed up road
to get to the dancing area, hell on a car, etc..
but the music was just fantastic!  Harry Who was great.  I really liked Joe
Harp..I think John williams was the one who destroyed me and plenty others.
The music was pretty fantastic, I must say....some of the mixing was 
lame, but the selections went great.  It was nice to see the milky way 
while dancing. didn't see any sfravers there, so we tried to be good
representatives :) ... we left at 6:15 or so, just because we knew the
drive would be hectic.  And it was.

Anyway, not as Unbelieveably incredible as the last devotion, but a fine
fine time...


gotta go..

Subject: More ramblings about Solstice


	The locations (especially Knolls) were SO beautiful.  I was
lying down on the hillside looking up and could swear that the sky
was a dome that came down about 40 feet back of me in the woods.  We
tried to remember our astronomy but all I could pick out were the
Dippers, Polaris, Venus, and Mars, and of course the Milky Way.  Most
people who grow up in the city probably never even notice it.  Whoo.

	Spend any time at all away from "civilization" (read: pavement)
and nature-based religions suddenly make much more sense.  You are no
longer even the short-term master of your environment: death is only 
a few days without water or a short fall down a fractured sandstone
face away.  The earth deserves our respect, for it will respond in kind.
We pour poison into the air; the ozone layer thins.  We pour poison into
the land; it comes back in the food we eat.

Anyway, I spent the day with friends at Knolls: we climbed some nasty
rock faces, boggled at the view, and slept most of the afternoon to
recover from the first night on the mountain.  It would have been worth
it even had no one else shown up, which seemed possible since the first
people didn't arrive until dusk and it was almost completely dark by
the time the sound arrived.  We debated following it out but they
encountered people back in the knolls and had to come right back
near our campsite.  Bummer >^)  The music cranked up and we dug out our
rave toys, bought that day at Radio Shack: some assorted LEDs and watch
batteries.  Clip 'em on and you can glow or blink all night, and several
more nights besides, unlike glowsticks.

Sadly, my 303 decided to make nasty background noises so I couldn't mix
any live acied (grrr) -- I could play anything I wanted so long as I didn't
mind an untunable octave wibbling in time to the panel lights on top of
it.  Gave me more time to dance, sleep, and stare at the sky, though.

Oh yeah, my friend and his friend were at their first rave ever.  Both
are on their tours of of post-Naval Academy duty, and both admitted to
having a beautiful time.  The meme spreads...

Apologies to the SFR crew and Pete for not introducing myself earlier, but
I hadn't seen my (best) friend (from high school) for over a year.  
Locations like that also make me want to be alone a good part of the time.
Sometimes places like that get me into a head space where I really can't
talk to people at all and I have to dance around or run off by myself
until I feel ready to come back.

I'd like to thank everyone who was there for being there.

Hint to Pete: If you want to clear everyone out just play more continuous
chipmunk breakbeat until everyone falls twitching in a heap from 909
withdrawal.

"Whoa!  Stop."
"Only half an hour?  Don't you like my "Funky Drummer" samples?"
"Love the taste...but the bpm's make me nervous."

My Truly Devoted Weekend:
 
I decided to give Devotion a try Saturday night. I went to a Sharon party last
year (at the Concourse) and really enjoyed myself there. Yes this one was in BFE
but I did not mind the drive as I have just moved to CA and actually enjoyed the
drive through the country side.
 
The map point was at Orchard Truck Stop/Restaraunt off Hwy 132 heading towards
Modesto. It was not hard to find, as practically every car on the hwy was turning
in there. As expected, everthing from here on out was very well organized. We
were greeted by some friendly workers who asked us to turn off our lights, and
get into one of the 3 car lines. Theses were very small lines when we arrived
(1:30am)about 3 cars were ahead of us. We payed our hard earned $20/person and
wereinstructed to go down the Hwy 1.5 miles to some campground on the right hand
sideof the road. This was just a matter of following the cars in front of us.
 
I started getting a little excited when I saw the neon glow of a laser off in the
distance as we were pulling into the campground. We were directed to a parking
place in a field by an alien space craft with lots of blinking lights. (not
really).
 
The first thing I noticed after getting out of the car and walking up towards the
main attraction, was the cloud of dust surrounding the entire area. Oh well, who
ever said you had to be clean at a rave?
 
The slightly wooded parking area opened up into a gigantic field of some kind
clumpy grass stuff where there were two trucks loaded with speakers and amps
parked about 100ft apart. The dj booth was inbetween the trucks. Behind the dj
table was all of the expected Sharon booths, selling raveclothes/hats/candy/smart
drinks/etc.. Psychadelic images were being projected into a sheet hung up behind
the dj table.
 
 
There was the typical Sharon laser show. It was being projected away from the
main dance area against a big projection screen, with mirrors above the screen
to reflect the laser back over the crowd. Actually, I think it would have been
better to have projected it out over the crowd, and let the trees off in the
distance act as the projection screen. They were very limited to what they could
do out over the crowd.
 
I easily got into the vibe. There were many people dancing.  The dj's were playing
very powerfull sets, mostly techno-ish fast stuff. The sound system was
very wellequalized for an outdoor event, producing clear crisp highs and ground
moving lows. There were also many people (most seemed to be mentally enhanced)
hanging out around the perimeter of the dance area enjoying a mixture of
outdoor peace and audio/visual overloads (and their nitrous).
 
And then, as if informed  by the galaxy gods themselves, I looked up. WOW! There
it was streaking across the dark summer sky right out of my childhood astronomy
book. The Milkyway. This was inspiring enough to stop my feet and grab a seat.
 
I did venture along the surrounding river over to the ambient/chill-out area.
They had the typical psychadelic projection setup and a laser as well. They were
not playing any music when I was there so I ventured back to the main area.
 
Another dj/dance area started up during the night off to the side. They were
spinning some pretty hard tunes, but not a lot of people hangin around.
 
Taking a quick look through my AutoStereotypic glasses I saw a few scaterred
drunken hillbilly undesirables, but everyone seemed to be obeying the peace
laws.
 
It had been really dark outside all night, and was kinda hard to see/meet
people. As the sun started to rise, the vibe really picked up. Bodies that had
been dark shadows squirmishing around all night, started materializing into real
people. The second wind came along and carried us to our peak. It was a powerfull
movement.
 
And then we left...
 
Conclusions:
 
 * This was my first big outdoor experience ( 300 < # < 500). There is a freedom
   vibe you get outdoors that you don't quite get inside. 
 
 * I think I made the right decision on Saturday. Much better scene than OSB.
   (Never been to a Wicked event, so hard to compare.)
 
 * Got alot of dirt up my nose, but I have put worse stuff in my body before.
 
 * Pretty good all around, but still room for improvement...

Subject: Re: Mission Rock

Gavin was spinning while I was there (with Garth providing
moral support, dancing behind the tables).
---------------------------------------------------------------
 he was doing that at wicked also, during the first (Jeno?)  DJ.



  I really liked
some of the stuff he played... the acid jazz was good, the
funkier stuff was okay (though he took it too far over to
disco for my tastes a few times)
----------------------------------------
This isn't possible for me, being a discophile from way back... while
 some stuff is definitely over played, there is a fine line between
 playing just the right jam from the past and playing a "sucker's
 favorite" like Super Freak or Brick House.


 but what I really don't
understand was his oldies revivals.  He played "White Lines"
and David Bowie's "Golden Years" 
-----------------
i dunno, i *love* old school rap jams...catch the beat, "you made me
scream, but i made you shout!", i see your point, white lines is headed
toward an S'sF rating, but still, those are funky tracks...if it was
put across right, i probably would have dug it.  


(screwed up the exit from
Golden Years, too) for an audience old enough to have been
bored by them long ago.  Nostalgia is evil.  Resist.
-----------------
i *was* bored by them, but haven't heard that old bowie for too many
years to publicly admit....
