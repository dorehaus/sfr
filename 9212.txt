Does anyone know where Prodigy get his samples?  I mean like the lines in

you can color me impressed.

	Could some of the more chemically inclined on the list
do me a favor and answer a couple of drug-related questions?
(Unless you're tired of doing so which I understand.)

	First, I've heard that there are (chemical?  molecular?) 
similarities between MDMA and Sudafed; could someone expound on 
that similarity?

	Second, I find that after I 'X', I more often than not 
develop a cold.  If 'X' lowers immunity to that degree, is there
any chance of contracting a more dangerous communicable disease?

	Ask me about cinema anytime....Jim  :)

Don't know where the Prodigy ones come from...

how about "I am the god of hellfire"?  I thought it was Jim Morrison,
but I heard it was from a movie.

What hip-hop song is sampled for "Autoshutter" by Plexus?  (i.e.
"known as a half-step but yours is a full climb you're making

	   I almost feel like this would be okay with my parents if they felt
   I was making money from this.  But I told them I couldn't, I wouldn't want
   to, because it would hurt my motives somehow.  Maybe I'm wrong.  They warned
   me against people "using me and walking all over me and getting me to do 
   things for free I should demand money for"... *sigh*.  What can I reply to
   this?  I mean, part of it is I freeze up in front of my parents and can't
   think straight.... another part is, I _can't_ ask for money for this.  I 
   can't.

Why not??  Why would that so inevitably corrupt you?  Why the assumption that
if you're making money doing something, that that's the only reason you're
doing it?

I don't buy it.  Your idealism is very beautiful, and you will only give it up
if you choose to.  I can assure you that more people become cynical out of
lack of money than out of having money!

Seems to me that you'd be doing the rave world much more of a favor by
arranging that you can continue doing what you're doing, i.e. by making at
least enough money to live on, than by giving it all up.  And if you find
yourself with an embarrassingly high profit from some rave, hey, there are
many desperate and worthy charities in this world -- AIDS and Bosnia and
Somalia and...

Did you know of the late rock promoter Bill Graham?  I don't know a lot about
him -- I'm not even sure I had heard of him before his death -- but it was
evident to me from things people were saying about him then that though he was
very successful, he never lost the spirit.  He still organized frequent
benefit concerts, -- I don't know all the details, but it is clear that he was
widely loved and appreciated and that the scene will never be the same without
him.

So it is possible to do good *and* do well (or at least to make a perfectly
respectable living).

P.S. I haven't seen any indication that you're letting yourself be used and
walked over, except by the shit who stole your laser.  I just see you as
putting a lot of energy into something you love.

I've never tried explaining the full scope of Twitch to my parents either.
I did explain how we get songs from record companies for free and manufacture
records and CDs and sell them to DJs.  But I pretty much glossed over the
whole concept of production and remixes and the style of music.

I have a feeling that I'll be sitting in front of one for many years.  The
idea doesn't really bother me at all.  It's not like I do this every waking
moment.  (Every once in a while I get up to refill my coffee mug.)

Me too.  Twitch will *not* be around in 1996.

It seems easier to make money first and then do what you want.  Twitch wouldn't
exist if Sybase wasn't paying me truckloads of money.  But then again, all I
did extra in college was a weekly 3-hour radio show and a weekly 5-hour club
gig, so getting school work done wasn't really much of a problem.

Yeah -- the problem is that school is time-consuming.  Working 9 to 5 and
spending an entire weekend raving (and working on Twitch in addition) is
*much* easier than going to school full time and spending an entire weekend
raving.

Wow!

Why would you doubt that it was Arthur Brown
(the record dates from 1968, Track Records, UK)?

He went on--without ever reaching the pinnacle of
attention again--for about a decade with records on
Track and Polydor.  It's a wonderful sample; everytime   
I hear it, it's like weirdnees in London's West End,
summer of '68, Portobello Road thrown in, all over
again.  There's lots of other 60s samples waiting
out there for sizzling 90s mixers to use as effective-

I suppose that the amount of time spent here doing non-work (news, mail,
calling agencies, etc) is a god send to me.  Sometimes I don't appreciate how
easy this job is.  I just have a hard time committing myself to the 9-5 for

Subject: RAVE information sought (please read on kind souls)

Hello there!

QUICK SUMMARY: rave information on x-mas / new year raves neede. This will
be used in a Finnish techno newsletter coming out soon. If you want
to help mail now.

I am writing this as a non-list member so I hope that I am not breaking
any unwritten codes and want to draw people's attention that if
they want to reply, they should do it directly to me also as I am
not on this list. Anyway, here's how the story goes:

My friend and I run a small techno newstletter thingy here in Finland.
It's a small A4 sized xerox that we hand out at raves and clubs to
people to spread word on techno / rave related info and to keep 
the scene alive. We've only come out with 4 issues so far and now
the 5th one is in the works. The 5th issue is planned for almost
immediate release (in a week) and we would like to include as much
record recommendations and rave information in it as possible. As
may Finnish ravers will be travelling abroad to spend their
x-mas holidays, we would like to include information on raves
all over the world. This way people would know in advance that
there's something going on in their destination besides the
usual club night out. Unfortunately we've been unsuccesful with
information on US/UK raves in general and this is where you hopefully
come in. If you know of an upcoming rave you think would definately
be worth attending, press the mail button now. All information
would be appreciated escpecially the time, the place, info-line,
musical style, live pa's and dj line up. As I mentioned earlier
we're in bit of a hurry and your vote counts ;-). Record recommendations
are also welcome (preferably with catalogue numbers included), but
the rave info is top priority. Thank you for your time.

Keep the faith,
Samu Z. Mielonen (f1sami@kielo.uta.fi)

P.S. My apologies for the horrendous number of typos and grammatical
errors in this post, but I was in a hurry... and if you think I ought
to be flamed, please flood my mail box, crack my account or drive over
my doggie, but please leave it off the list.

I'm still awake and at work direct from Come-Unity.
If I went to lunch today there would be NO-WAY that I would have made it back 
to work, and I need the bread, soooo, sorry folks if you missed me but I'm
sure someone ate my share of the pizza :)

Come-Unity was wonderful last night, in fact as I move away from it, it gets
even beter.  I've been depressed a little the last few days, yesterday was
not a good day for me, an old telephone bill caught up to me to the tune
of $1400 (ouch) so I was a bit glum at Come-Unity. I just couldn't get into
the Vibe, not even when Garth came on. So I gave up and went over to the chill
out area and just sat and listened to the music, sorta dozing. When all of a 
sudden this really cute girl sits next to me _very_ close, she tells me this is
her first rave and then she asks me if I came alone! (unfortunately she didn't
but we exchanged numbers) well this did boost my ego and by the time Jeno came
on, I was feeling a bit better.  Jeno was a real warrior as far as the vibe was concerned, he was relentless, he didn't give up and eventually by about
6 am (we all surrendered) and the Vibe got REALLY strong.

Most of us retired to the after party that the Come-Unity people have near
the Castro.  It's in someone's apartment!  They just bring the turn tables
mixer, amp and a couple of enclosures and hook them up!  I don't know what kind
of arrangement they must have with the neighbors cuz it was LOUD.
It reminded me of the early days of hip-hop when the DJ would set up the 
turntables in the kitchen and the speakers were in the living room.
Everybody brought their coffee and tea was offered.  I left to go to work around
9:30 as United States of Love was playing.

It's 3;30 now and I seem to have my second wind. and all this
without chemical assist! (Well I did have 4 cups of coffee today :)

Comments: This album places Liam Howlett as the definite breakbeat master.
Unlike a lot of breakbeat compilations, I wasn't snoozing by the end, and
unlike some techno artists, Liam wisely placed new remixes of his singles on
this album for everyone who already owns them.  The result is one of the best
releases of the year.  New tracks like "Music Reach" and "Weather
Experience" have me scraping my brain off the ground with their explosive
energy.  Of all the remixes, "Hyperspeed" dominates in a blur of speed.  In
comparison, "Everybody" is a little weak.  "Ruff" and "Death" are also a bit
mushy.  The production is superior, with each track blending from one to the
other, but still distinctly indexed for single play.

Summary: 9/10.  Prodigy is definitely a cut above the rest.

Comments: I only bought this disk for the Eden Transmission track, but there
are a few other gems on here as well.  However, there are some real stinkers
too.  Can you imagine a techno version of "Jesus Christ Superstar"?  Uranus
delivers it to you in all its bowel emptying glory.  Sonice Adventure and BBC
sound like bad versions of Quadrophonia, which isn't great in the first place.
Lewis Lovebump does deliver some interesting acid, "Bee of Honey" is
especially cool.  D.O.G. is ambient house in the DFC smooth style, Mind Over
Rhythm sounds a lot like System 7.  Finally, back to "I'm So High", Eden
Transmission transports us on a deep pumping cross between ambience and a
driving chant.

Summary: 6/10.  The highlights are really swell, but the drek is appalling.

11  3   05:38 Holy Noise: Get Down Everybody (Funky Beat Mix)
12  2   05:53 The Second Wave: Let The Groove Move (Groove Mix)

Comments: Not a bad collection of tracks from Belgium's ARS label.  About half
of the bands listed are not on ARS though.  Despite the cover's hype of
"Exclusive 12" Mixes", I do have several of these tracks on other compilations
and singles.  "Voices" surprised the Police fan inside me with the same chorus
lyrics from their release "Voices Inside My Head" thrown onto a funky tribal
beat.  Quadrophonia's track is OK, but this is better than their standard
level of "annoying."  Other highlights are Meng Syndicate, Mainx, and
Transformer 2.

Summary: 7/10.  Good collection of acid, tribal, and a bit of trance.  Better
than the majority of comps out today.

Comments:  A stunning dive into the analog realm.  Aphex Twin reaches for new
sounds and rhythms as he explores the world of electronic music.  Ambient,
yes, but at the same time, some very dancy trancy tracks on here.  "Xtal" is
stunningly beautiful.  I was besieged with, "What is this?" requests last time
I DJ'd it.  "Green Calx" manages to be hard and ambient at the same time, it
sounds like guitar strings being run over by a drill press.  There is a bit of
sampling scattered throughout, but you have to listen for it since it
definitely doesn't fall under the standard "sound bite" usage.

Summary: 9/10.  Analog heaven composed by a musical genius.


Church of Extacy: Devil Beats

4   3   06:03 Devil Beats (Disciples of Trance)
5   4   05:28 O.K.

Comments:  Although each track stands on its own, rather than variations on a
theme, Newmann & Wells have continued their same level of boringness as the
first Church of Extacy EP.  Of course, that EP had at least one decent mix,
and this does as well, "Dance With the Devil".  The rest of the EP is just the
same old diddling with the same hard techno sound.  "Who is Jesus" has got to
be a joke, since it sounds very close to Interactive's "Who is Elvis", but
that is beyond the point since both songs suck.

Summary: 4/10.  Phooey.  Liquidate the church and give us some more GTO.

5   4   05:17 Hardcore Heaven Mix
6   4   06:04 Revelations (Dettro Mix)

Comments: A much cleaner release for HHFD than some of their past singles.
There is a bit of annoying chipmunk sampling, but their regular samples are
right on, including the FGTH "Relax" sample in the "Dettro Mix".  "Now is the
Future" smoothly shifts from house to hardcore, back to house again all the
while cleanly preserving a raging beat.  "Drop It" sticks to the hardcore with
more of a rumbling bass, then tosses guitars in later.  On all the tracks they
manage to come up with some great drum lines.

Summary: 8/10.  Acid, ragga, hardcore, and house twisted into original mixes.
HHFD makes some yummy beats.

I haven't really been to any mega raves, but I have been to several free 
parties around Wiltshire & Somerset & Devon. 

Most of the trouble I'v be heard of was caused by inner city gangs of
hardened criminals and drug pushers wanting to make a fast buck. When
they arrived at one party they were met with strong resistance by
travellers and had to go away. Apparently they were trying to sell 'E'
that was little more than heroin and amphetemines. Also some of them carried 
weapons.

Another instance was at a 'rave' held at Westpoint organised by a crew from 
Brighton/London. I was not in attendence but I heard reports of bad things 
happening. People being searched on entry and having loose change, chewing
gum, etc confiscated by 'security' [i.e. I should read 'Criminals here' ].

A popular pastime in some clubs I used to attend in London was for security 
to join up with several drug dealers and rip punters off by the dealer selling
his wares then reporting the buyer to security who'de promptly confiscate the
drugs, return them to the dealer & eject the unfoetunate punter from the club.

I *much* prefer attending events organised by people I know, preferable with
small numbers of people ( <2K ) in attendence.

Phil

The whole reason I stopped going to raves was because I was nearly stabbed at 
one a few years back .....

Does anyone leso remember the wonderfull SLAM raves that used to be held in
central Scotland (featuring DJ's like Andrew Weatherall , and the Slam team of
Ord and Stuart) ?
The first two raves were great , and there was still an atmosphere of peace and
friendship ..... then came Slam 3D , which was held at Ingleston in Edinburgh ,
and a whole load of Hibernian FC casuals turned up ,with the sole intention of 
getting into as much trouble as possible ... Me and my friends were all standing
dancing ,when about 15 of them started circling us ,and naturally we all got 
rather paranoid . We started moving away ,and they didn't follow us ,but we
spent the rest of the night in utter fear for our safety , because we all had 
to wait for busses back to Glagow .The end finaly came ,and while we were 
getting on our bus ,we heard shouts of "there they are ..etc.." and about 20
Hibs fans started running at us , knifes ahoy .... luckily at that point , there
were about 60 people from Greenock , and we managed to make the bus driver get 
us out of there ASAP ....

It totally put me off ,and I've never been to another 'rave' since ,and this is
when the violence was an exception not the rule ,as it is now ....

This is why I'm so bitter about the average 'raver' nowadays , it's just more
of the same ....

As Jim (Ui14) pointed out , the murder at the weekend was outside the rave , but
it follows that the murdering Bastards were at least inside , or attempting to 
go in ,so it really backs up my point about the geezers who want to go to these
events .....

If your going to some Christmas raves , take care please , I don't want anyone
else to get as paranoid as myself ....

Subject: Party Crews on KCOP (LA)

Greetings, ravers! Here's the long ago (and you thought i forgot about it)
retelling of the KCOP story. . .

***************************************************************************

About one month ago, I was visiting Orange County on business for a week.  It
was quite boring to be away from home, music, and raves for 5 whole days, so
in the early evenings I would turn on the tube and zone out for a couple of
hours until the fun hour came and then go out and scope out the scene.

On a Tuesday evening, I was channel surfing until I caught this teaser on
KCOP, the Fox owned station in the basin.  The teaser said something like,
"On the news at X, we'll visit L.A.'s growing party crew movement".  That
sounded very intriguing, so I stuck around to watch the festivities (hmm,
parties, i thought!). 

It turned out I had stumbled onto a 3 or 4 day series in which the reporters
trailed around behind some local underground promoters as they visited ad
hoc "ravettes" put on by high school folks from the basin.  Episode 1 (that
I saw) was pretty positive, showing lots of folks dancing late at night, even
some sounds from a Moby remix.  Very promising stuff. Scenes of folks handing
out cards to other parties.  People talking. Lasers, light shows, DJs spinning,
speaker stacks, lots of people dancing.  Cool stuff.  This went on for a good
5-7 minutes.  Very promising.  Then, the reporter dude comes on live and says
"stay with us tomorrow when we'll take you to a break-in party." Hmmm. . .

Next day, on schedule, they follow some of the same folks as they break in to
a beer distributor's warehouse, redecorate, and throw down what looked to be
a bitchin party.  Cut to the reporter live, very concerned look on his face,
"Yes, [generic female reporter name goes here], we did see some evidence of 
illegal activities, like that break-in.  Tomorrow, we'll show you a ditch
party."  Hmmmmm  . . .

Third night, they show us a throw down ravelet during the day.  This is when
KCOP pulled out all the stops and showed beer-chugging, school truant, joint
smoking, paper eating day time partiers, stern neighbors, and pulled off the
the gee, look at the nice kids attitude and launched into a nasty rant about
the decline of youth, illegal activities of minors, corruption of morals
thang.  Muy disgusting.

****************************************************************************

Overall, I was happy to see that some folx in the basin are having fun. I
was very unhappy to see the reporter pull off the gloves and cast the whole
scene as nasty.  The first epsisode I saw had lots of folx saying "Hey, man,
we just like to dance.  We ain't into no gangs or nothing; we just like to
party."  Right 'tude.  The later epsisodes seemed to focus unnecssarily on
all the bad things that happen at ravelets.

This all put me to thinking that we were spot on to not let the media into
one of our events.  This could have been us, only on _national_ TV. Acccck!

This would seem like a good place and time to hear about peoples

Personally, the only hairy experience I have had was several years ago
outside a rave where there was no kind of organisation and everyone was
arriving in buses at the same time causing total chaos and resulting in
half the crowd not getting in.  However, things seem to have gotten more
organised since then...

I have heard of violence at raves being linked to bad drugs and E with
heroine in it (mixmag) - what are peoples opinions on this?

E WITH HEROINE MIXED IN!!
Yeah, Iw was talking to Garth Wednesday morning, and he mentioned that this
mixmag stuff was going on in the UK.  This is scarey stuff.
Although I don't think it has got that bad here yet, Brothers and Sisters
please be careful.  A lot of busts have occured the last couple of weeks
and I'm sure some of the people who supply drugs will try to "keep their
profits high".

Well, lets think about this a little....  A lunar eclipse happens  
because the earth moves directly in between the sun and the moon.   
The moon is new, full, waxing, or waining because of where the sun is  
positioned.  I would think that putting these two together would  
indicate that the moon would have to be full when there was a lunar  
eclipse.

And now back to your regular programming.

Subject: Come/Unity and Comp/Uter trouble...


If it's not one machine then it's another... :)

Well, medisg.stanford.edu is down for a little bit, so if you've been
getting bounced mails resend them now, I'm temporarily running it off
of soda.  (which means, sfraves-request won't catch the bounces from 
bad addresses - this is only temporary, don't worry).  

Anyways, Come/Unity was a blast - I do stand slightly corrected, it
was 18+ only after 2am (and they were still checking ID's, so if you
lost yer wallet... :)  There weren't more people there than usual, and
the visuals weren't any different than the last time, but the energy 
was still great enough to feul us 4 non-dosing ravers until 6am.

Garth played a great set, as usual, but he hasn't been buying as many
new records as he should have... his set sounded exactly like his lasyt
couple of sets I've heard.  Jeno, on the other hand, played some GREAT
stuff - a few songs after coming on he played this funk-era song, live
bass and drums, the whole thang, which he then bridged into a song which
was, say, 25% house and 75% funk, then 50%house/50%funk, etc... almost
as if he were showing the connection between the two.  It was cool...
then a while later he played this song that at first sounded like it
was causing massive 50htz feedback somewhere - the bass at first was
a constant tone rather than a beat.  Then it feintly started fading in
and out, then fading in and out more radically, until it became a
sine-wave beat sound... it was pretty cool.  A look at the label revealed
it to be "Edge of Motion" by Motion Beyond.

They used a different space for the chill room this time, and in my opinion
is wasn't as good as having it in the front room because it was just behind
the front right speaker stack and you got a horrible hum in there.  Ah well.
The people were friendly, and there were cushions everywhere (but no
Richard Sun / Malachy ambient setup like before... ah well.)

All in all, the best $5 I've spent in exactly one month.  :)

I didnt go to the last one, but I really liked the big white ball on the
Cieling with images being projected on it.  They stopped the images around 1:00
and started with the rotating lights, they were also cool but I liked the ball
better.  I think that one of these balls scaled down a bit would be great for

with some inexpensive and small visual setup.

What was this ball made of?  I've heard of this being done before, but nobody

Subject: Hard Copy vs Raves


The "Hard Copy" rave story last night was purty darn awful...
what they were covering barely resembled any rave we're used
to.  The subject of the story was a 19-year-old girl in 
Ft Lauderdale, FL who had been shot and killed as a bystander
when a gunfight broke out at one of these "raves".  

But they had these "promoters" describing raves by saying that
they rent a warehouse, buy a few kegs, and send out flyers
to a local high school.  So the reporters had the perspective
that raves were these highly illegal (criminal), dangerous
and unsupervised parties.

It seemed like every time they used the word "rave" they gave
it this special emphasis with an ominous pause afterward to
strike fear into the hearts of parents nationwide.

And then the kicker is that they played Nirvana's "Smells Like
Teen Spirit" throughout the story.

I sorta did something like this a few years ago.  The problem, of course,
is getting power to the projector without a cord wrapping around something.
If you can find the _remains_ of a helicoptor light, you can mount it on
that.  Many (most?) have electrical contacts as concentric circles on one
side (the mounted side) and "brushes" on the other side (the spinning side). 

Anyhow, a cheapo solution.

I have some problems with this topic, one with the mix
and one with peoples reaction to it...

1) Heroin is more expensive than E. If you wanted to water
down some drug, you tend to do it with something that is
less expensive. That is why you find E mixed with speed,
speed is really cheap. 

2) Heroin and mdma would be a much better mix than mdma and
cocaine, or mdma and speed (IMHO). Speed and coke are much,
much nastier drugs than heroin. Heroin junkies tend to be
much more mellow than speed junkies.

Yes.  Ketamine is used by veterinarians.  It's extremely similar to PCP and
has been somewhat popular in certain raves for a while now I'm told.  This is
probably because it is fairly easy to get (via a vet or something similar).

I think of heroin being much nastier than speed and coke, since
the former is a narcotic and highly physically addictive, while
speed and coke may or may not be physically addictive (although
they are psycologically addictive).

Hello out there--

You didn't finish your musings, Don and Lyle,
so just to be sure we got the following sorted out--

>lunar eclipse is always a full moon?

Well, lets think about this a little....  A lunar eclipse
happens  
because the earth moves directly in between the sun and the
moon.   
The moon is new, full, waxing, or waining because of where
the sun is  
positioned.  I would think that putting these two together
would  
indicate that the moon would have to be full when there was
a lunar
eclipse.


--but, of course not all full moons are at lunar eclipses!
Now, does nayone know whether this combination is as common
(or rare) as a "blue moon"?  Does anyone else out there
know what the blue moon phenomenon is--and why we have
that expression?  I ain't blabbin' unless you're (a)
interested and (b) willing to take the virtual pop quiz.

Subject: Escape from New York


It was very intense and I have been up since 6am New York time, flew
to SF, showered and at work now. I knew TAXI had a similar adventure
a while back, but I don't remember what he did.
I will try to make it short, please excuse the run-on sentences, typos and
misc errors.

Thurs: Flew in, found my friends in the village, had dinner,
 went to a bar,  went to limelight.
It is a beautiful church with a zillion little rooms all over the 3 floors.
Every room has different music. The main dance floor is very crowded
and the music was very hard. Information Society
played 1 set, someone threw a bottle at them on stage and smashed into
a million pieces. They took it surprisingly well. $15 to get in. $5
for bad beer and well drinks, $1 for water and no smart drinks. Free
fruit and snacks.
At one point, the main dance floor turned into a circular wall of
standing people watching one or 2 people breakdance (sometime even to
the music) in the middle of the big crowd. The floor was undanceble
since the ring of people got big and took over. Some of the dancers were
good. The other rooms are more fun. All the people there are drunk.
Everyone chimes "Hardcore" at various intervals. very alcoholic.
Closed at 4:30 am.

Fri: Went to museseums during the day, had dinner, went to another bar for
drinks, went the NASA at the shelter. After seeing all the problems of the
SF scene, (busts, too many half empty raves, etc) NASA restored my faith.
It was the most friendly and mellow scene. There are 2 rooms, one is
harder, the other one trancey. $12 to get in with a can of food. (I had to
ghet a can of beets :) ), Free water, very tasty smart drinks( Renew U and
Intellex from Nutrient Cafe Wholesale, Chris???) mixed into a fruit shake.
Many hugs from a lot of people and Brigitte(new friend) brought vapor rub.
Back rubs, dancing and conversation with Nathan and Denise (new friends) who
had these cool pendants. No busts, no police presence.
The standard price there was $25 (I asked)
It went on til 8:30 am. 

Sat: Recovered remarkably well from the night before,
Went shopping at SOHO, Canal St, W/E village. Went to get Belgium beers
at the Castle of beer worship, 2am and we made preparation to go out again.
Hung out with some new friends(friends friends who drove in from Ann Arbor)amd
Went to Webster Hall to find out where to go next, since they
close at 4:30, and no one knows where UFO is (from the ne-raves cal)
 Talked to a couple people; They asked me what I wanted,
 after the last 2 nights,
I had to say HARDCORE, all night dancing. They pointed me to SAVE THE ROBOTS,
which doesn't start until 4:30am, so we hung out at a local bar, playing
pool, pinball, etc. At the door of the ROBOTS, was a bunch of people,
there were no markings of any kind, the doormen peeked out every now and then,
did the membership song and dance, ignored the other people standing around
 and gestured me to get in. He let me in with my friends($12 each) and
send us down to a small basement with a handful of people sitting around,
and the house beat going. Then it was a swirl of music and lights, more
people: queens, straights; dancing, talking. Then I discovered the line -
the main "feature" of this club, the line to the bathroom has double
meaning, no one goes into the bathroom alone. I saw 7 in there once, one long
line. I did talk to someone there,Allysia, she seemed paranoid about a lot
of things, but somehow trusted me with her jacket.
 "You won't rip me off, would you?", while she looked for her friend.
 I was somewhat in
and out of conscienceness at this point. Too much stimuli, too fast,
 too hard.  Allysia showed me the room upstairs later, I was there for
hours and didn't know about upstirs. It was a shocking contrast.
 A bright gentle room with fake
oriental decorations and beach Sand covering the floor. I later found
out what the beach sand is for. Juice for $2. and free water. There were
lots of very well dressed people, and the interaction seems like one big
singles bar ( for gay and straight alike). Everyone seemed to
feel good and there were lots of energy.
Many hours later, we were outside and feeling very ragged.
 We went into a diner and ordered only HOT tea. The waiter
gave us a sympathetic "I understand" and didn't bother us at all
after that. I like this diner. My 2 new friends had to drive home
 to Ann Arbor to make it by Monday, but luckily they knew their limits
and decided to sleep it off for a while. The city whirled into life
outside.

Sunday: My mind was tapioca pudding and the only things I could handle
were herb tea and Aladin, which restored me somewhat, great animation!

Monday/Tues: Tourist stuff - Statue, world trade center, etc. At night,
CBGBs, continental for various lives band. After 4pm,
when all the bars closed, the 24 hr diners were the place to be with hot teas,
pastries and a good book. I was crasing on a studio floor and my friend
had to do homework and get up in the morning for class.

Weds: Here I am tired as hell. Hope to see you all soon.
Will (Penna), I take it back, every chemical has its distinct effect. I
had never seen such distinct boundaries in each club till last week.

IMHO, most of the stories I've heard about ketamine pale in comparison
to acid horror-talez....I don't want to scare anybody, but it seems to
me that ketamine is a much more "serious" drug than what most people
are used to....I think there might be a reason (other than
availability) that it seems most popular among chemists and hard-drug
users, rather than the LSD/E crowd...I'm not doctor, nor do I play on
TV, so, my comments are pretty useless....

Oh well, ho hum....

Subject: Re:  Things to Come? (was:mixmag)

Thanks M,
I'm going to try and get a lot of work accomplished this weekend.
Both work-work and rave work.
Those shows like Hard Copy, and shit like guns after people, will surely kill
the Scene quick here in the Bay Area if we don't start NOW adding positive "Counter-Spin" to the mediaa image.

I hate to sound so paranoid, but in this country [USA], the utimate confrontation between the "Authorities(Government,Mafia,
Insert-your-favorite-Group-here) and the Scene, will not 
be at some warehouse or beach, but on the airwaves.

We need to write articles, and prepare ourselves for being able to go on
NightLine if necessary, I'm dead SERIOUS!  We need to be ready to inject our
own energy should the media event arise. Start training yourselves.


SUGGESTIONS
------------

	1. Let's add stuff to the "Soundbites file that was started 
	   awhile ago.

	2. Everybody start tracking the media (if that's your thing, if it
	   isn't that's ok too :) and try to post when you hear something
	   that you think is significant one way or the other.

	3. We need people who can speak on radio and before cameras in a clear
	   calm and knowledgable fashion.

	4. We want all those people out there who will hear about raves
	   (one way or another) to hear the positive messages, hopefully
	   BEFORE they hear the negative, ones, first impressions are 
	   important.

	5. We're not trying to convert anybody, I repeat, we're not trying
	   to convert, what we are trying to do is use the mass media
	   to call out to our raver bros. & sisters and tell them that we
	   love them, we are with them, and to keep the scene alive, where-
	   ever in the world they are, we want to let other people out there
	   who feel the same way that we do, that they are not alone.

	6. It should be obvious to some of you on the list that "raving", is a
	   mneme, or "information virus". (my definition folks, don't flame me)
	   What information you "tack-on" to the phage, determines whether
	   and how that info can replicate.  Well we gotta tack-on good stuff.
	   The virus has a life of its own, it's the "spin" that determines 
	   how a deeply penetrating virus can be used.  Sorta like trying to
	   direct an ocean liner into port with a tug boat, you gotta be in
	   the right place at the right time, with the right amount of force
	   ready to apply.

	7. With the country already gearing up for some holiday "festivities"
	   in Africa, let's remember that we still live on a planet, with
	   guns, and a bunch of LOADED nuclear weapons around. 
	   (Funny we're keeping track of the russians Bombs... who's keeping
           track of ours!)  The stuff that we are experienceing in the 
	   scene is happening on a globle level,   It's not about Right or 
	   Left, or Good/ Bad, raver/cop, raver/gangster.  People have to 
	   start taking control of their lives, their country and their World.

	8. I know some of this must sound trite and Californian, especially
	   to our bros. and sistrs in the UK, but at worst, it won't hurt,
           and at best?...

	9. Let's finish the alt.rave FAQ and spread it first to media people
	   who are somewhat responsible, we might need to edit this to 
	   protect people and the Net. Concentrate first on getting quality
	   and truthful information to people who are ready to agree with us,
	   worry about the others later.

	10. Spread the Vibe. Keep It alive.

Its funny the stigma against heroin which exists in this 
country. I know people who would never touch heroin, who
would injest huge amounts of lsd, speed, and coke (and 
MDMA for that matter).

Someone who is familiar with the medical database could
probably find statistics on the addictivness of all these
drugs. If someone starts looking, they should also probably
look up caffiene, because that is definately physically
addictive, and nicotine (ditto)

susiez sez:
I think of heroin being much nastier than speed and coke, since
the former is a narcotic and highly physically addictive, while
speed and coke may or may not be physically addictive (although
they are psycologically addictive).

Uncle Dan sez:
(This is not a flame) If you don't believe that speed and coke 
are physically addictive than you haven't done enough of either! :) 
A person becomes psychologically addicted to heroin a long time
before that person becomes physically addicted. The reason that
people do heroin is because it is so great! You feel wonderful!
All the little aches and pains disappear and you get a feeling
of wonderful contentment. If that kind of feeling doesn't mix
well with MDMA, I can't imagine one that would.

hey!  wait a second!  just because hardcopy and a bunch of high school

and/or florida!

this could've happened anywhere..  basically what happened is that some 
high school kids got together and said, 'let's have a keg party at a 
warehouse and we'll call it a rave.'

the dj was also one of the high school kids and he said something to the 
effect of, 'the music of choice at raves is INDUSTRIAL.'  

it was obvious no one involved in the thing had any concept whatsoever of 
raving and none involved were participants in the _real_ rave scene..

to be fair, i have seen a fair amount of good publicity in the papers 
down here about raving also..  you all just know how papers are..  the 
entertainment section writes a 3 page piece about raving that is somewhat 
flattering, and then the other sections that must be the 'shock'-sections 
write about 'satan-worshipping, all-night, hedonistic, crack-parties that 
our wonderful high school youth are falling prey to.'

	Special K was popular on the rave scene down here in LA
about a year ago.  Never done it, but  for some reason all of my friends
spoke about it with a certain amount of awe or dread, as though it 
were this really hardcore thing. I don't know why, or if there was
any basis for that reputation.

P.S.  I've only done white, brown, and pink X.  The brown was mixed with

or friends who didn't know what was in it.

They still do, i think somewhere in the $20-$30 range for an 8 ft diameter one.

Though if you do it this way keep in mind that most helicopter lights (at
least the ones i've played with) have a transformer in the base to convert
to a voltage the lights can handle (usually 6V), so you might want to 
bypass the transformer.

As long as we're talking visuals, anyone else checked out the animation

	"You think I care if white weasels wanna play, or 
	sit by the radio for what I gotta say?"

	This is about Geoff's post about the need for a positive spin
on raves in the media.
	Whew.  I dunno.  This isn't a flame--I definitely agree at one
level.  But these are a few thoughts.
	Raves are kind of a secret culture. Even though they're not
completely secret anymore, and are getting less so every day thanks
to 90210, Hard Copy, et. al., the whole point behind them is sort
of a secret between people who really understand; people who are 
addicted to bass and endorphins.  Even if a few articulate ravers were
to stand up and talk about what raves are really about and what makes
them cool--a sense of community, a bass that rattles your teeth, 
Barry Weaver and DJ Dan sharing the turntables at six a.m., striped 
shirts--I don't think the mainstream would understand.  Actually,
I think they'd hate it.  Ostensibly, yeah, they hate dirty warehouses
and drugs and kids losing sleep and white people hanging out with
Latin people, but what they really hate--what really gets at them--
is people having fun, people doing something other than work or
socially acceptable leisure, people who think imagination is more 
important than knowledge. It's always been that way, from Plato
to the Calvinists to George Will.  They already know, even if it's
only subconciously, what raves are all about, and they hate it 
anyway.
	The mainstream isn't fair-minded anyway.  Ask Rodney King or 
that nun who's in prison for protesting the Gulf War.
Ravers and like-minded folks will always take shit, no matter how
legal, polite, or well-spoken they are.
	If the mainstream hates or fears something, they'll do it 
anyway.  Hip-hop culture has spent the past several years desperately
trying to counter-spin its negative media image, and it hasn't worked at all.
Closed-minded people hate it anyway, and that's that.
	For me raves are a reaction to the mainstream, and I don't
want to play the game anymore, I want to withdraw in disgust.
Fuck the media. Fuck 90% of the people in the world.  I don't care.
CUT THE MIDRANGE--DROP THE BASS.  
	This is not, repeat, NOT negativity or hatred.  I just mean
I want to be left alone, and I don't want to waste my life worrying
about what people I have nothing in common with think of me.
	Finally, this is the thought that haunts me at night sometimes.
I don't even know if I agree myself, it just pops into my head
occasionally.  I don't know if raves are neccesarily positive or 
community-oriented.  They just ARE.  The bass is just there, and 
doesn't judge or even care about you.  It's like the ocean. 

	("There's no beginning and there is no end.") 

	("JAMES BROWN!!!")

	Like I said, I agree at some levels with Geoff.  But I don't 
wanna do it.  If I live my life the way I want to, I'll set a good
example for the people who understand.  That's the only positive spin
that will really work in the end. 
	I just want to dance.  NE TRAVAILLEZ JAMAIS.

	Yup, for some reason the site for Cumulus was busted before it began.
So after making the mistake of trying something we had heard about at the
Transamerica Pyramid (ew.. don't EVER go there. :)  we called the number again,
which directed us to 6th and Harrison (the End-Up) where we were given a small
hand-written photocopied set of directions to another warehouse in South SF.
It was an interesting building, with many different rooms, but a lack of a real
dance floor meant the energy just never was there (at least for me).  It looks
like they put a lot of effort into it, and there were a LOT of vendors there,
but having the DJ in a room where he couldn't see most of the dancers and the 
two speaker stacks were placed really badly meant that this event kinda didn't
do much for me.  Oh well, I would sound silly if EVERY rave I went to was great,
wouldn't I?  :)  

	Spun played a great set, and I spent a lot of my time at the event 
watching him spin.  Instead of slapping a new record down every 60 seconds, he
likes to toy around with two records at once, having both on at the same time
and make microfine adjustments to the fader between the two.  And he often used
rather popular songs, just really weird remixes and done really bizarrely (like
Bassomatic and Baby Ford and a few other more commercially available toonz.)
We even played "Towers of Dub" from U.F.Orb at +8, "call for Haile Salassie"
intro and all.

 Not a synonym suggestion - when I was trying to explain SFRaves at work
to a rather conservative colleague , I was inspired to describe us as a
"dancing club", ie - an informal group of people with email access who get 
together to go dancing. He seemed to accept that - he asked me what kind of 
music we dance to ( Oh oh - I was anticipating a request to tag along at one
of our next "get-togethers"!) . I told him it was mostly modern , noisy
stuff with a big beat. He wrinkled up his nose, and changed the subject

Uncle D. replied on this already but I don't think he was quite
clear enough in rebutting: speed and cocaine are very
addictive and very dangerous!  Decades of propaganda have given the
monkey Heroin (should be capitalized, you know, 'cause it's a
trademarked brandname of Bayer: "Heroin, the sedative for coughs!")
a nasty reputation in all aspects, but the fact is that Heroin
withdrawal, nasty as it is to experience, is medically blithe.
Cocaine has a similar withdrawal pattern.

Amphetamine withdrawal, though, is *very* dangerous and should only
be attempted under competent medical supervision.  Same for
barbituate withdrawal, but the reason these drugs weren't demonized
like Heroin is that they were the drugs of choice for the power
elite (JFK and his B12/Dexedrine shots, for example).  They were
also the cash-cow products of major pharmaceutical companies.

I focus on withdrawal pathology since that is the most physically
dangerous aspect of these drugs.  Addictiveness comes in second,
and once again amphetamines take the prize.  Amphetamines show the
same pattern as opiates in permanently insinuating themselves into
the basic brain chemistry functions.  Amphetamines are more quickly
and more thoroughly physically addictive than opiates, and they are
psychologically more addictive in that they tend to bolster instead
of suppress ego.  This is the ultimate appeal of stimulants.  You
feel ten times more alert, powerful, emphatic...and you are, of
course, except that you're not aware that a Newtonian
equal-and-opposites reaction is going in in your brain chemistry
such that you'll suffer an equal crash of low self-esteem,
lethargy, etc. if you don't get more of the drug.  The nice thing
about the empathogenic amphetamines (MDA, MDMA, etc.) don't put you
on this brain chemistry treadmill.

Don't be fooled by needle phobia: whether a drug is normally
administered by injection or by methods less connotated with
junkiedom is no measure of its relative danger.  The worst worst
intravenous drug abusers were the original methedrine mainliners.
Just because injection is no longer the method of choice for crank
doesn't mean it's gotten less addictive.

 	Yup, for some reason the site for Cumulus was busted before it began.
 So after making the mistake of trying something we had heard about at the
 Transamerica Pyramid (ew.. don't EVER go there. :)  we called the number again,
 which directed us to 6th and Harrison (the End-Up) where we were given a small
 hand-written photocopied set of directions to another warehouse in South SF.
 It was an interesting building, with many different rooms, but a lack of a real
 dance floor meant the energy just never was there (at least for me).  It looks
 like they put a lot of effort into it, and there were a LOT of vendors there,
 but having the DJ in a room where he couldn't see most of the dancers and the 
 two speaker stacks were placed really badly meant that this event kinda didn't

[...]


We did this too.  We came to an interesting revelation.

facts:
1.  The old party was busted by 11 at the LATEST.
2.  The new party was at least 5 miles from the old one.
3.  At 11:45 the following were true:
	a.  The sound system was set up
	b.  All the associated vendors were set up
	c.  The DJ's were spinning
	d.  The flyers to the new place had been photocopied
	e.  ALL THE LIGHTS, lasers included, were in place and working
	f.  They were charging $20, instead of $15
	g.  Very few people were there for a party that was ~3 hrs old.

Conclusion:  The old party never was supposed to happen.  The price
was always going to be $20 (they lied on their phone message).  The
old location succesfully drove off the cops.  It also drove off a lot
of people (Gunther and I waited outside til 12:30 to see if anyone we
knew showed up and realized that CARS_LEAVING == CARS_ARRIVING).

If anyone was there the whole time (through the bust) and can prove
this wrong, I'd be interested to hear about it.  It was a clever way
to deal with the police, but I'm still pissed about the pricing scam.
It looked like a good $10 rave.

G and I ended up at Love Garage and had a good time... Sorry we missed
anyone at cumulus.  (Jan Cooley played a pretty good set, which
surprised me... I don't usually like her choice o' tunes).

C'ya,

That's the track he chose to go out with.  Jeno did not look very amused
trying to find a way to mix out of it -- he just cut the turntable and let
it spin down, then went into that weird blues-harmonica track (does anyone
know the artist/title of that one?)

Most people mistakenly do.  Heroin is probably better for you except
for the fact that quality is not stable and people occasionaly die
when they get shit that's a little better than they thought it was
gonna be.  We also grew up in the 70's and heroin was the model for
a realy bad drug that only bad junkies took.  Crack and all of it's
associated problems is exponentialy worse than heroin and it's associated
problems, it's just that not many people have gotten over their programming
and realized this perspective.  The fact that it's an i.v. drug makes
heroin seem scarier too.  Oh ya, and they are both imported by the C.I.A.

One reason might be that people realy into ketamine shoot it i.m., although
I know you can smoke it and maybe oraly ingest it too.  In addition to 
other precautions, if you were gonna do ketamine, I'd be real carful that
what you were taking was legit (especialy in L.A. because of the abundance
of p.c.p.).  I guess you can do lower dosses with a different effect from
the ketamine I've read about because from what I understand about ketamine 
it is not a social drug.  On high enough doses people totaly loose touch
with reality and a weird phenomena is that people commonly experience
similar "trips" of alien abduction scenarios and other interaction with
strange beings, etc.

Subject: A Thoughtful Interlude

I want to take a moment to ask everyone to consider the following few
comments I have to make on the sfraves postings of late.   Note: 
these are definantly only IMHO.

1.  Drugs
	There have been a lot of posts on the subject of ecstacy or
other drugs lately.  I've responded to a lot, mostly due to the fact
that my educational background enables me to give an "educated guess" 
on questions about the chemistry side of things.  A friend of mine
mentioned that this may implicate me in some way.  I initially sort of
shrugged this off, since any chemist would be able to give the answers
I did, but it's dawned on me that the way the political climate is
today, he may have a point.  That led me to think about why the hell
we were discussing such things on the list at all.  Look people, there
are lots of places on internet to get info on these things.  This list
is about raves in the SF bay area.  There are those who would argue that
drugs are a big part of going to raves.  My response to them is the
same as my response would be to someone who said that raves are bad
because they are drug-filled parties.  That response is, "Drugs are
everywhere, not just at raves.  It's sad that drugs are the main thing
you can see when looking at raves, because you're missing out on a
lot."
	Another group may say, "Fuck them, it's my right to say what I
want to say."  I really agree.  However, there's a difference between
exercising your 1st amendment rights and just begging for someone to
stamp you out.  Think about it...if any of the various projects about
chronicling the rave movement are to fly, they must take that into
account.  Think about this: who is your intended audience, ravers (who
already "get" it and need no manifesto), historians (sorry but I could
give a fuck less...that is then, this is now...) [[no offense 
Arthur :)]]), or the average guy today, who DEFINANTLY is swayed by
government anti-drug policy.

anyway, next topic...



2. The death of the rave scene

	Geoff, before I start, I want to say that your motivation and
concern is amazing, and I respect it greatly.  I also realize that you
are far more experienced in such matters than I am.  The following is
the way I see things, based my experience.


Definitions, Manifestos, and subjective meetings will kill the rave
scene.

	When you are talking about a scene in a stylistic sense,
musically or otherwise, change is good.  Think about it... if a scene
isn't dynamic, it becomes mainstream, and then outdated.  Scenes are
kept alive not by defining them, but by allowing them to evolve.
Keeping a scene 'underground' is silly.  If part of it becomes
mainstream, good.  That just means that the majority of people are
starting to appreciate the early stages of whatever you are involved
with.  The true test is if the artistic style that makes up the
movement is rigid or dynamic.  Think about it this way, where is the
industrial scene now?  2 years ago it was huge... now it's either
atrophied or moving towards speed metal (a regression).  Or this way:
At my first rave (last January),  most of the music was techno.
Now most of the music is what some people have termed 'progressive
house', a term I hate, but it illustrates the difference...  The rave
scene [here] is still dynamic and alive.  Change is what will insure
that.  Definitions, meetings, and manifestos will help in the short
run, but will eventually hamper it eventually.

Comments?

(I especially want to hear from Will and Geoff!!!)

-H-

p.s. a note about e-mail
People not used to the way the internet works often fall into a trap
thinking e-mail is private.

e-mail is NOT private.

The internet handles mail using a method called flood-search routing;
That means that whenever a site gets a mail message, it broadcasts it
to EVERY SITE IT IS CONNECTED TO.  For people my age, it's like
tinkertoys... each internet addr is like a wheel, connected to other
internet addrs via spokes.  whenever any message comes in, it's
rebroadcasted along each spoke, until it gets where it should go.  
That insures that mail will get through no matter which specific 
site is down.  It also insures that your mail is accessible to 
whomever really really wants to get at it.  

Think about what you e-mail.

The scene *will* be defined, the only question is are you
going to help do it, or will it be 48 Hours and freinds?

Well, if industrial culture is dying because it was too
rigid, whose fault is it?  Where is the manifesto that gave
it the rigor mortis?  Is it all because of RE/Search?

If you hate this term, then why are you using it?  Everybody
here will certainly understand if you call it "Epic Techno". 

This illustrates what *I'm* getting at.

1)  I totally agree with Howard about drugs.   Please let's keep threads
about heroin and cocaine and addictiveness and such to more appropriate
arenas, like alt.drugs.  I know that it seems like a family here, and that
it's easier to ask your "family" these questions than the world-at-large,
like you would on USENET.  Resist this temptation.  

    It's very easy to forget that there IS a WAR on DRUGS still going on, a
propaganda war very much like Germany in the 1930's.  It will only be a matter
of time before someone makes a post (to any of the mailing lists or newsgroups)
about the recent use of a drug, and gets his house searched by the DEA 
immediately after.  You can say this is hearsay, and you're probably right,
making a post about drug use would _not_ proove anything in a court of law.
But still, I really don't need DEA agents rifling through my underwear drawer
(underwear drawer?  did I say that?  ooops... I mean... the... shirt drawer,
that's it, the shirt drawer...).  Enough hysteria.  I think you get the point.


2)  I want to back Geoff up here - what he's primarily concerned about is
bad press and bad vibes, not with making an impact on history.  There are
two sources of this - one, lazy and/or ignorant journalists, and two,
irresponsible promoters.  Geoff wants to affect the latter group, mainly
to try and imbue a sense of responsibility to them, to help make them act
more like a family than a group of cutthroat corporations.  Though there
are good promoters and bad promoters out there, they ALL could learn a few
things, which we have been attempting to articulate.  

	As for the bad press, what I think the rave scene could really use 
is a public figure, a senator from the house nation, preferably someone 
older and wiser, someone who can be respected and trusted by both camps 
and is able to adapt to changes well.  He could act as a liaison between
the authorities and the promoters.  He could educate both the authorities
on what raves really are (not teenager-high-school-keg parties with Nirvana)
and in turn could help educate promoters and us ravers about our 
responsibilities.  I guess, we need a rave Bill Graham. (no flames about the
man - you know what I mean).

	That is kinda lofty, I admit.  So shoot me.  =)


3)  Yes, Virginia, e-mail is NOT private.  You might as well yell it across
the room at the next town council meeting.

In a samiliar vein (vain? =), my high school has announcements during
3rd hour on  Munday/Wed/Frydyaz...They have these 2 guys that are
always st0ned doing 'em., and occasionaly they'll start out with some
music..Usually it's oldie Hendrix, Floyd, but they played the Smart
E's a few weeks ago....I practically wanted to get and start movin'
during my Psych class - it was hard not to (and I *like* Ses. Treat,

BTW, it's cool to see raveculture catch on here in
Podunckville-Conservative-UpperMidWhiteClass-Colorado... An old
girlfriend of mine who now lives on the CoKansas border even knows
about 'em....wowee zowee!  And techno displays featured at every
big-ole-chain record store, let alone the funk-e places we have like
Wax Trax and La Case de la Funk....'tiz the wave of the future!

BTW, speaking of rAveculture at schools, I got sent to my dean's
office for wearing my 'Dope' shirt that is in the style of the Dole
banana/pineapple logo

BTW, speaking of the Smart E's, anybody buy the CD?  Please re-vue...

Subject: TOP TEN RAVES OF 1992


	The coming of the new year brings the inevitable flood of "top XXX of
1992" lists, so in that spirit, I'd like to compile a list of what everyone
thinks were the top ten raves in 1992.  So if you could send me your 5 most
favorite raves from the past year, I'll be willing to compile the answers.
When you are making your judgement as to your favorites, please try and judge
them independent of the quality of the drugs, if any, you may have taken there 
- i.e, "Yeah, Wally's World was the best - I had some totally killer E that 
night!".  No.  Also, the Basics this weekend and the Gathering on New Year's 
are likely to be memorable ones, so let's say any rave up to today, Dec. 6th, 
can be counted.

	It would be great if, when you made your selections, you included
a short blurb about why you liked it... after I compile the answers those
blurbs would be a good way of illustrating why particular raves were good.

	One last detail - weeklies/monthlies that occur in the same space
every time (i.e., Come/Unity, Wickeds @ King Street, Wickeds @ 1015 Folsom,
etc.) can be listed as a selection - you don't have to say, "The Come/Unity
in March", etc.  But I would like, if you are going to list the Full Moon
Raves, please mention the month (or if you forget the month, the location).
It would be best if you sent these top fives to me personally, but if you
have a unique spin on them feel free to send it to the list.  

	To get things started, my top five:

1.  Connection, August 20th

	(This is obvious. :)

2.  Woopy Ball, March 5th

	This was my first real rave in San Francisco, and I liked it because
the organizers put a _lot_ of time and effort into it, they had a huge chill-
out warehouse with live ambient musicians, two other warehouses with different
styles of techno, and it was the first multi-day rave I have ever heard of that
actually kept people for the second night. :)  It was so good that after I
had to leave around three to bring my friends back home I went back and stayed
until 8am.  ;)

3.  The November FMR, at Berkeley Marina

	This should be obvious too ;)  

4.  Vision - September 5th

	Never before had I seen so many people so FOCUSED - when I first
walked in I thought "shit, another huge warehouse rave with too many people"
But that ended up not being the case - the vibes were just perfect for me,
and the music was "fantastique".  

5.  Come/Unity - The energy and the vibes, what more can I say?  Oh yeah, 
and the $5 cover.  :)


I would love to make this a top ten, I could certainly go on forever (I have
7 more FMR's I'd like to list. :)  but I think narrowing it down to five would
be best for most people here.  

So lemme have em!

this might be very cool.  wouldnt it make the picture or image rotate too
(ie. as it turns around the room, the image would turn upside down, and then
return to normal...)  with a spiral picture or something it would make the

evolve into their little geographical niches, and each major will have
a "scene" (already exists)...Next we'll have the promoters arguing and
not wanting to come together (already exists, even here in Colorado),
and then we'll have violence at raves (already exists)....

I forget ewho it was that posted the manifesto to change things, but,
I had an idea I never posted:  A national network (not just e-, since
there are plenty of ravers who aren't "enlightened" about the ent),
consisting of a mega-zine (like a magazine, but for a more specific
audience) for all ravers and DJs and promoters, and other means that
would hopefully fulfill the purpose of taking personal gain out of the
picture, and replacing it with uni-t, peace, and a consensus vision of
togetherness.... 

If their are any zinesters out there, someone might want to consider
starting a zine on a *international* scale..I believe it should
unclude some sort of dogma or diatribe of basic principles that
everyone *should* =) agree upon (ie, "we do not value hate or
prejudice, we do not value violence...we value harmon-e and
togetherness and a global rave communi-t"  or something like that") -
something that takes the $$$$ and power out of it.....Feasibly I could
see some sort of symbol for the magazine, which could be reproduced on
t's and hats and flyers that would garner curiosity, and have
"representatives" at raves to spread the word - sort of a rave
"anti-police" - have the masses rule the masses, not the police or
media or money-grubbing commercial promoters, etc....

I'm tired, and I, I want to go to bed....later for now...

I havn't gone through all my mail as yet, so I hope this hasn't yet been
posted.  Anyhow, at the Oasis in San Jose this Thursday (Yes I know God
forbid) is Deep Space, the first installment of what is supposed to be a
weekly endeavor.  In any event, the DJ lineup looks so promising it really
seems worth the effort:  Jeno, Thomas, Spun, Shon, Vitamin J, Dani, Rick
Preston and Harry Who.  It's quite your ensemble piece.  It starts at 7,
goes till 2AM and there's some sort of .50 coctail pre-party the flyer hints
to.  The phone says invite only, what this means (do I just bring the little
flyer?) isn't terribly clear.  But after 9, it's open door.  $5 cover.  I 
believe the Oasis is on North first st., I'll check.

Subject: Re: TOP TEN RAVES OF 1992

I think the Top 10 idea is really cool, but I have one niggling criticism
of the ground rules.  Why should all regular events get lumped together as
one event, and why make an exception for the Full Moon?  What constitutes
a regular event?  Last spring there was a series called Wax, all at 520
4th St. -- there were one or two that stand out in my mind as being better
than the others.  Same with Come/Unity, and Mr. Floppies.

Here's my proposed solution:  there should be two categories of voting;
10 best single events (which would include a specific night at Wicked or
Come/Unity), and the 10 best series (which would include things like
Sharons and Gatherings as well as weeklies and monthlies).  That way we
don't have to split hairs over whether or not a series could be considered
"regular".

Oops, it seems I misread Brian's proposal slightly -- I thought he meant
all regulars *had* to be voted-for as a single entities, when what he
actually said was "could be".

Still, I think my last proposal is a good refinement and should be
implemented.  It's like with the Grammies:  there are separate categories
for Best Song, Best Album, Best Group, etc.  There isn't an award
for "Best Song and/or Album".  So let's do the two categories.  And
the FMR's are a candidate for "Best Series" along with all the others.

The FMR's are relatively different each month, each having a different
location and different psyche, while the other weeklies/monthlies, at
least the ones I went to, did seem to have a constant feel or vibe to them.
Opening it up to individual specific nights on those is sorta like splitting
hairs...  I guess I'm asking you to judge the monthlies/weeklies overall.
BTW, Basics would NOT count as a monthly, since it's held in a different
location each time, and enough has been written about them to show that
each can have a different vibe.

So basically:

If it had a unique name,

or a unique location,

it was a unique rave and not a weekly/monthly.

I also appreciate Geoff's concerns, and especially the commitment and
energy he's put toward finding a way to resolve them.  OTOH, 
in many ways I don't share his alarmist interpretations of recent
events.  A lot of the things he's pointed at (promoters screwing each
other over, drug ripoffs, etc.) have been going on since the early days.
I'm not saying we shouldn't look for ways to improve the scene, but I
don't see how the scene is facing imminent death, either.

A flyer for one recent event (no names, but it happened this weekend)
included a diatribe that contained the following thoughts:

> ...it is evident that any negative action committed on any one
> in the scene will effect the vibe of the entire scene.  Any
> crime committed against any member of the scene is a crime 
> against the entire scene.
> 
> Raves are not merely money grabbing schemes but are events
> aimed at enhancing everyone's lives and uplifting hearts and
> minds...
>
> We all need to protect our scene.

First of all, notice the almost-Freudian slip, "not merely money
grabbing schemes..."  In other words, they are money grabbing
schemes, but other things as well.

Secondly, the promoter behind this event has been known to do things
such as hire a hall for an "all-night" rave that he knew had to be
vacated by 2am, then arranged for the after-party at a club far too
small to hold more than a fraction of the original attendance.

Apparently what prompted this diatribe was the fact that he was
ripped off by someone he recently collaborated with on a huge event.
This promoter had also been victimized in the past, more than once,
and had given back to the scene by sponsoring a two-day long free
outdoor event.

My point is that there are no perfect angels in this scene.
I know of several promoters who many (including myself) regard to
be among the most scrupulous, who have done fairly sleazy things.
It may help to put all these people in a room for a few hours or
days and talk things out -- then again, it may not (it may not
even be possible to get them in the room to begin with).

But despite all this, we still have the FMR's, we have Come/Unity,
we have (hopefully) more Connections...  There is still a lot of
positivity happening, and by encouraging this positivity we will
keep things alive despite the inevitable human foibles that crop up.

In short, have no illusions, and you won't be disillusioned...

As far as the press is concerned, perhaps we do need a "Senator",
but part of me agrees with William Poe that invisibility and
concern but not obsession about our public image may be the most
effective survival strategy.  It's hard to argue against his point
that the mainstream is never going to feel warm and fuzzy about us, no
matter how much PR we churn out.  Not that we shouldn't keep trying to
improve our image, but I'm not convinced it's going to make or break us.

SFRaves.  So here's the deal - 

If anyone has a set of pictures from a memorable event, particularly FMR's
or the daytime ones, let me know, and I'd be happy to reimburse you for
development plus some.  And if you have any videos out there that are of
decent quality, I'd be interested in that too.  One side goal would be to
collect some visual material if we ever decide to officially release an
SFRaves anthology, but right now I'm acting selfishly and would like something
to remember this year by other than my school record.  =)

  What's up, all..  I'm glad that I've found a place to communicate with
 others who are interested in dance music and the scene.  I'm from NY,
 so it'll be interesting to see what similarities and differences exist
 among our respective scenes.

  I'd like to list for you some records which I've heard recently and
 really like.  I apologize if they've been discussed before..

  Here goes:

  Rotterdam Subway/General Noise  (Rotterdam Records) - Hardcore from Amsterdam.
     AGE (Analogue Generated Energy) (X-Force Records) - Beautiful acid/trance
                                                      from Germany (303!).
  Remy Presents the Traveller II (Wonka Beats) - Nice Tribal from the label
                                                 which brought you the
                                                 Aquastep EP.
  TrancePorter - 'Open Up Your Mind' (SpaceMate Recordings) - German trance
                                                              from Cologne.
  THK - 'France' (WARP Records) - Nice melodic song with a really uplifting
                                  sax solo toward the end (UK, I believe).
  The Black Dog - Vanttool EP (General Productions) - Amazing prog. techno
                                                      from the UK.
  The Trance Setters (Sp?) - Fantasizing (I don't know the label) - Fairly
                                                                    self
                                                                    explanatory.
     Monotraxx EP (Adam & Eve) - Disturbing hardcore (Germany).


  There's so much more..  I can't really remember off the top of my head.
 The list is pretty current, to the best of my knowledge.  A lot of the
 stuff getting played out here right now is hardcore..  If you like
 hardcore, Rotterdam Records and Adam & Eve are good labels to look
 for..  X-Force is good too..

  There's a growing interest in the more ambient and trancy stuff here
 though, which I predict will be coming out of the chill-out rooms and
 onto the floor in the near future..  (at least the more danceable, faster
 material)..

  I've gotta run.  Once again, I apologize if I've told you things which
 you already know.

So the Intrepid Ravers [only 2 of us this time!] once again proved to be the

Thomas was great in the morning - I really like his style of music in the 
morning.  

I have to say I thought it was pretty dumb to choose a space that was busted

Mykl clued me in later about Cumulus... instead of insipid dealings,
it sounds like they basically just had really good planning for the
second site.  I'm pretty impressed that everything got moved and set
up so quickly.

On the other hand, they lost a lot of business by charging $20
initially at the new space.  If they had said $15, like on the voice
mail, Gunther and I would've walked right in w/o even thinking twice.
It was basically just a psychological thing.

We saw at least 20 cars pull up and leave in the hr. we hung out w/o
going in after hearing the price.  Figure on 2 people a car average, 
that's a lot of money lost.

Sorry we missed you and Peter, and also Anne's birthday posse.

I'm sorry the promoters lost $4k on the space.

These are good ideas. Keep it up.

Oh BTW we did have the meeting at 23 & Stockwell. About 10 people showed up
including a Tibetian Monk/Priest.  There was some reasonable dialog on the
issues of violence and gangster activity in general going on here in Sf and
internationally.  There will be another meeting next Sunday where we will
further explore these issues.  One of my opservations is that we have a few
problems of our own to deal with before we can deal with this big problem:


	1. Some people don't want to deal with it and hope it will just
	   "go away"

	2. Some people are really attached to their own personal agendas
	   around the "scene"

	3. Some people don't want the scene to be "defined" thus they don't
	   want others to make global statements.

	4. SFraves is a unique arena in that people here feel safe enough
	   to post how they really feel without fear (generally :) of
	   personal attack.

Some possible ideas like frisking were brought up and tighter more trained
more intense security.

But by far we all did agree that we have to start taking care of eachother
more at these things.

Several people also told their stories of encounters with the "darkside :)
at some recent raves.

More to follow later.

Say, you wouldn't be talking about Halim of "a rave called sharon" would you?
The aforementioned scene being the Longshoreman's Hall fiasco?

Actually, the Sharon beach party cost a few dollars. (But it was great, the
only Sharon event I've ever felt positive about!)

Halim and his organization probably still have a massive Karma debt on
their hands.  The problem w/ Karma debts is they have to be paid off
with interest... And only the Creator, in its dice-throwingly random,
nondeterministic, quantum-glory knows when the bill has been paid.

20 years from now, the mainstream will be us. Just like the summer-of-
love/hippies/woodstock, etc are all looked-back-upon with misty-eyed
sentimentality by those in the media & mainstream today, the same may
occur for the house/techno/acid/hip-hop movements of today. At the
rate things are going, sentimentality, media acceptance, etc may set
in before one-generation-gap's length-o-time is up. 

If and when most of us become old geezers (40-60 year olds), we'll
probably be hearing soothing musak covers of techno songs in
elevators; we'll lament the lack of melody, rhythm, and musical
structure in our children's music; we'll long for the simplicity of
the days of old -- Air that could be breathed unfiltered without
causing cancer, the ability to walk the streets without being accosted
by gangs of neo-visigoths, a population that wasn't ravaged by AIDS,
that semi-pacifying feeling of hope on the horizon, etc. We'll think
back to the glories of Our Rome -- before the fall.

Or at least the good parties we had while it was falling.

Sorry to rain on y'all's ecstasy-induced love parade. Like, you know,
I wouldn't want anybody to think that I'm "negative" or anything.

PS: take two, action! -- we already are the mainstram. the media says this:

	(1) when I turned on my TV last night, I found myself watching
	a video of a really cool-looking rave on the SF public access channel.
	(turned out to be a promo for Sound Factory / 21CV / 543-1300 )

	(2) whenever I listen to Live 105, I hear The Orb, either classic
	stuff like "Little fluffy clouds" or modern stuff like "Blue Room".

	(3) they showed ravers on the TV news last night in a story on
	"Haight street, then and now"

I'm just tripping that we have such a wide age range on the list.

I wish I new about raves and the internet when I was in high school.
Actualy, I wish they had raves (around here) when I was in high school.


Said like an old timer:

Why, Andy when I was your age we didn't have promoters putting on fun
organized parties.  We had to do things for our selves back then.  We
had to go out an party in the cold at night in school yards n' parks.
Why, we were lucky if we had a ghetto blaster to listen to... and we
liked it that way, etc.

pretty weird.  we only paid $15 when we got there.

it was a strange evening.  after dinner we were to meet at zanzibar's
for a pre-rave warmup, i guess.  after circling the area a zillion
times and not finding parking, we decided to head straight down to the
rave.  it was already getting close to midnight when we hit the
highway.  we got there to find the cops in force.  fortunately, our
house is only minutes from that rave site, so we bagged it back to HQ
to regroup and replan.  the voicemail wasn't helpful at first, but
eventually it told us to go to 6th & harrison.  we did, and didn't see
anybody from the rave.  this was making me quite paranoid and rather
upset as i had used up most of a tank of gas that day.  we drove
across the street to the shell station to try to phone the voicemail
again and found the flyer-handing-out person there.  she gave us a
receipt for some car painting place in santa rosa!!  we decided this
was a mistake and showed it to her.  she then gave us a proper flyer
which directed us to the actual location.

we finally got there close to 3 am to hear dutch and carlos doing a
really cool 4-turntable extravaganza.  (didn't hurt that they were
messing with the UVC 12" when we were waiting to get in.)  i like
their style, and they did some cool stuff with *both* sides of the uvc
record.  yow.

anton then performed an almost perfect thomas ripoff set before spun
came on and did his usual almighty god brilliant stuff.  someone tried
to correlate the number of joints he smoked versus his efficacy as a
dj but i don't think there's any relation.

we split just as jeno had taken over.  a fun night but not something
i'd care to repeat.

This is a quick survey (6 short-answer questions) about those DJ mix tapes
that are sold at raves and record stores.  It's very short and will take you
less than two minutes to fill out.  Please fill this out and email it back
to me.  (In the interest of eliminating useless network traffic, please don't
email it back to sfraves.  If anyone really cares, I'll post the results.)


1) Do you buy these tapes?  If so, which ones do you own?

2) What is the maximum you would spend on one?

3) Which local DJs' mix tapes would you be most inclined to buy?

4) Which local DJs' mix tapes would you be least inclined to buy?

5) Most DJ mix tapes do not come with track lists.  If the tape did come
   with a track list, would you care?

6) Is sound quality much of an issue?  i.e. If a tape has shoddy sound
   quality, do you feel ripped off?

Subject:  Cred was incredolous

After a hard week at work and an even harder day Saturday working around the
House I decided I really needed to let loose.  I really wanted to Rave but was
not too excited about the Raves for Saturday night. I didnt want to do Juice,
never really liked it.  Sharon the space didnt seem big enough and Credo
sounded good but the last four Raves I have been to have been at the King
Street Garage.

Saturday evening came and my raver friends Ellen and Cidy stopped by told me
they were going to Credo demaned I go.  After taking a nap I went over to my
Raver nieghbor Talked him into going with me, we did not regret going.

Go to Credo early around 12:00 hardly anybody there.  The place never got that
full but was lots of fun, plenty of room to dance and a really fun and real
crowd.  The King street garage has always had great energy and more real people
than not, especially for smaller raves  ( I wasnt too crazy about the last
Wicked). 

I was with a really #007#reat crowd, including SFraver Paul Richards all night
long, we were in these little huddles never have I \

It was nice to see MykL again and to finally meet Taxi and Jamie

After the Rave I went to the EndUp for the first time.  I had a great time for
the short time I was there.  I like the space alot, especially the outside
patio and the people were really cool.  I still like DNA better for the music.

I am curious to how Juice and Sharon went, anybody go?  how about an update

Subject: Publicity panic

Concerning any attempts to somehow curtail the consistent flowering of
negative press concerning the "rave scene," I am wondering perhaps if we
should evaluate some other criterion beforehand.  First of all lets 
consider the sad but very palpable reality that rave promoting is essentially
a very, very accesible medium.  If one says that drug dealing, is the last
free enterprise, what about raves?  While clubs are a regular tumors what
with the liquor licenses and fire codes, raves are far simpler in their
constitution.  Permits are basically white sheets.  Flyering an imfo are
regulated businesses.  Beyond that, it really appears as money is the 
catalyst in a number of these productions.  Especially the overboard
extravaganzas that have cluttered coffee shops and boutiques with their 
numerous flyers.  With a handful of eager investors and some shrewd planning
anyone with the patience and zeal can put your own evening together, and
who knows, maybe even spin the turnstile a bit.  And lord knows has this not
happened?  Therein, lies the problem.  While journalists won't pass by
you average FMR, they much more likely to visit your Sharon or Toon Town.
And what happens, everyone gets clumped together in the same dismal broth.
And really who have we been casting are darts upon on these boards for
months anyhow?  The Sharon/Toon Town etc. And whom do the media lampoon
? The very same.  As people are ready to clump trance or house together
with tribal, egads, they are just as ready to align your Come/Unity
with a Caspar.  This is the potential catastrophe.  As rave promotions
remains such an accessible, open field, there really is no one checking
the quality of these subsequent parties to any effect.  And when these
monstosities are thrown, i.e. Caspar/Sharon, God bless it it they don't
malign the whole damn scene.  I'm not saying some level of quality control
needs to be in effect, although I'd welcome it, but this is a larger
problem than abandoning the word "rave" when describing one's all-night,
throbing, dance get-together.  I wish it were that simple.  The media
may be zealous in the barbs they cast on this community, but with the
unchecked promoting that is so vast, it really remains a challenge to
put some lines down in this scene.  i.e, no goddamn it, that is not techno.
or no goddamn it, this isn't a Toon Town, this is *us dancing together*
The scene can't be this ridiculously broad.  The positive scene we are
slowly developing just can't and simply shouldn't be held accountable
for Jerry the raver in Jersey who took a gun to the d.j.  Or wherever.

Hi Niels--

I liked your post--thoughtful and mostly
right-on.  But as one of those "old geezers
between 40 and 60," I don't like your over-
generalization--it's slighly ageist and a bit
wrong.  One of the things I like about the
rave scene is the wide range of people--race,
orientation,age--that was not true of most of the
psychedelic dance-concerts I've gone to in my
life, starting with the Longshoremans Hall dances
in the early 60s and up to the Dead concerts of today.
Nostalgia is a state of mind; I admire people lik
Tim Leary (age 73) who are still clicking--and there are
a ood number of us--like the interchange between Mark
and Andy, the guy with the third kid in junior high
school and the guy who's going to high school now.
(Above I meant to type--a good number of us at both
ends of the age spectrum)

So...that's some progress in coming together, I think,
at least in the psychedelic culture!

World's second ravingist geezer,
Will

Sumex is the last place I'd rely upon for getting security software...
it's by far the largest Mac archive so anyone who you are worried
about reading your e-mail will be able to easily get a copy of the
program.  Since the blurb said, 'communicate with someone you've never
met' and it's a public key algorithm, then either a.  you need to
exchange keys by e-mail or otherwise (in which case crypt will work,
just exchange a salt and key with someone somehow) or b. the program
works independantly and will work with any other copy of itself.
Since both of the above cases remove the need or possibility of secure
e-mail in the case of average user (the first requires an exchange of
keys, meaning either you have to talk to someone and thus can have
secure conversations w/o using e-mail, or requires that you send the
key over an insecure channel, and the second makes the messages
decipherable to anyone with the program) I'd be worried about
considering the communications private.  The best bet is just not to
e-mail things that you're worried about the authorities discovering.

Subject: Sunday's meeting


I schlepped my way through the rain to Geoff's rave-violence
meeting on Sunday, in part because I figured I would be one
of the few who would even consider going.

I was somewhat bemused to find the meeting dominated by
these buddhist guys and arguments about whether or not it
was cool for them to dominate the meeting.  And all in all,
for guys who claim to be transcending their egos, the
buddhists did a great job of being petulant and insulted and
in general full of themselves because their activities were
not entirely appreciated.  Didn't we realize that raves are
*spiritual* things?

Everyone always wants to define raves in their own image.
Me included, of course, but at least I'm conscious of the
problem.

Anyway, like Geoff was saying we did discuss the real issues
for awhile.  Weapons searches at the door was one of the few
suggestions I heard that I hadn't thought of before, and I'm
not sure how I feel about it.  I know in the past I've been
scared away from going into clubs that feel the need to
search everyone for weapons.  I also don't usually
appreciate having to empty my pockets for people (I carry
*huge* amounts of crap around with me.)  And on top of it
all, I have my doubts that weapons searches are that
effective... I can think of several ways of getting a weapon
passed a body search.

I pass on some rave tips from another member of the meeting:
It sounds like Love Garage is dying, but the Groove Kitchen
has made it passed the "looks promising" stage to being a
real success.

I would _love_ to go into the city to eat, and you know I won't be able to pass
up dancing afterwards.  I'm really looking forward, even though I'm completely
not ready for my finals and I just found out one of them is going to be a 
_multiple choice_ history final.  Now I ask you, how is that possible?  What's
up on your finals agenda?  Of course, I hope it all goes smoothly for you.
OH dear, they're closing the lab (yes, I'm here again!).  I just wanted to
check in and say hi, maybe on the talk, but I saw your message and just got so
excited.  I can't wait to see you.  I think we'll have a really good time.  We
always feel so comfortable around each other.  Let's talk soon, but until then
good luck with everything you're doing.  I love you.  Keep the stress level low.

	ok i finally had that experience that just hit me like a
	ton of fucking bricks.

	after a day and night of work i wanted to rave a bit, and 
	the fellow i work for nicely pulled a string at *groove
	kitchen* which got us in for free.  btw preston is a cool
	person!  anyway, susie and i arrived, danced about 1/2 hour,
	took a break, and found our way to the cornerup by a subwoofer.
	(maybe you saw me, in mostly all black with my favorite fuzzFez.)

	anyway we were not very altered, 'specially by rave standards,
	and i was really getting into the bass and dancing.  the music
	got more and more hardcore/bassBass.  all of a sudden i saw	
	myself from across the room, just in a flash.  but i had never
	felt out of my body like that before.  wow.

	later as i was still dancing and meditating on recent sfraves
	discussions about evil and violence at raves etc etc i decided
	that what this room needed, what i needed to do, was to send 
	out all the uptime positive love vibe energy that i could and
	just ground all the pent up negativity of the crowd with my
	positive earthCharge.  i did so for about 20 minutes, dancing
	so enjoyably.  my arms waving like mandelbrot's finest
	fractals...

	eventually we moved on, susie and i did some wonderous touch
	dancing by only touching the energies around our bodies instead
	of our bodies.  'twas cool.

BUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUBUGBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUTBUT

	BUT!
	but...

	this part still trips me out... we were finally just left to
	sitting on barstools trancing on the visuals, still bobing
	our heads and psyches to the holy beat.  this guy comes up
	to me, someone i have talked to before... he is a fuzzy 
	english guy who flyers for wicked sometimes... he likes
	to talk to people he flyers to, very soft spoken and 
	lover-dovey... ANYWAY he comes up to me, holds my hand an
	says "thanks for coming tonight.  you really added to the vibe."
	go back and read it again.  my mind was agape, i was beside
	my self beside myself.  it works.  it really really works.
	everyone, do it.  that's how to save the "scene" or movement
	or whatever.  
	
	what we are doing now is a vehicle for what is to come.

Rocky,
	Thank You, thank you, thank you (suzie thank you as well)
	First thank you for your timely post.
	Second thank you for doing what you were doing.  Most raves
	that I goto these days, I'm actually "working", sending out 
	positive energy, this is why I'm so sensitive to the negativity
	of late, it's too much for me to move, but you In your post reminded
	me of something that I was doing wrong,  I wasn't grounding myself
	or the negativity! I was letting it get to me and overwhelm me, instead
	of "grounding it into the Earth which can "recycle" it.

	Yes you have discovered that "sending" can be a very blissful 
	experience indeed, and it does help. 

ANYWAY he comes up to me, holds my hand an
says "thanks for coming tonight.  you really added to the vibe."
go back and read it again.  my mind was agape, i was beside
my self beside myself.  it works.  it really really works.
everyone, do it.  that's how to save the "scene" or movement
or whatever. 

	Thank you for saying this, I didn't want to say It cuz I thought:
	1. This was too "airy-fairy" and we needed more concrete measures.
	2. I didn't want to step on anybodies religious concepts (or lack
	   therof)

	But yes, IMHO you are indeed right and these actions will be
	the most powerful and influential.   Now for the concrete part.
	As I have said, I've been going to raves and doing this for about
	6 months now (I had a similar experience to yours at the first FMR
	at Bonny Dune) and try to "send" as much positive energy or Light
	or whatever you want to call it as I can.  Lately, I have become
	sorta ungrounded and physicaly sick cause, I was  doing it too much,
	and I was not properly grounding myself [If this is too
	crunchy for some of you, you can hit delete now :] (yes Lee, you do see
	me at a lot of the good raves).  Rocky your post was like a wake-up
	call for me.

	Now I have an Idea and it is really wild, when I thought about it 
	I was hesitent to post about it cuz of some of the reasons that
	I listed above, but since rocky in his innocent courage has broken the
	ice, I'll just say it.

	As I said, I'm getting sick doing this alone, I need help.  I;ve
	had this thought that one way, the best way to combat this negativity
	is to have "Senders"  (the word Channeler is too overloaded these days)
	small "teams" of maybe 2-4 or maybe more for big raves, who would
	have an informal meeting before the rave to meditate together
	and sync-up and would then go to the rave with one of the objectives
	(along with having fun of course!!) being to send as much Vibe, Light
	Positive Energy, whatever you want to call it) as possible.  The teams
	should be "multi-denominational" in other words, it don't matter
	what kind of religion/belief-system/practice/outlook you have
	the main thing is that you want to help in this way.  I know
	certain techniques that are non-denominational, that I can teach 
	people, mostly how to ground yourself (I should follow my own advice :)
	and how to meditate, stuff like that, how you spread the
	Vibe is up to you, as long as we sync up beforehand whatever we do
	as a team will be perfect.

Subject: Cryptography


I think most of the posts here about cryptography are (and for that
matter networking) are missing the point.

A cryptosystem does not (should not) rely on `security through
obscurity', ie on keeping the algorithm secret, so it doesn't help at
all if the NSA have a copy of the program.  The RSA public-key
cryptosystem relies on some elegantly simple number theory; it
certainly doesn't have any back doors designed into it.  As with all
practical cryptosystems, however, it can't be proved to be
cryptographically strong, but it is believed to be. As to whether the
NSA can break it, who knows? -- they certainly wouldn't tell the
academic cryptographic community if they could.  Most cryptographers
would say that given sufficiently long keys it's unlikely that anyone
can attack RSA -- but you'll have difficultly getting any firmer
guarantees than that...

Of course, no amount of technology can help you control which
newsgroups and mailing lists people chose to read, but technology
_can_ make email secure (for certain definitions of secure).

If you're not familiar with the concepts of public-key cryptography,
you'll be surprised by how powerful a technique it is.  You might like
to fetch PGP 2.0 from an FTP server (it's free) and read the
documentation.

Unfortunately, however, public key technology is patented in the
US, so you can't actually use PGP within the US without a license from
PKP (which you're unlikely to get).  Also, because cryptographic
software is a munition, you can't export it from the US, so don't try
and FTP a copy from a US site if you're outside the US -- this would
make you an international arms dealer!

As to the legality of sending coded communications electronically, ask
a lawer.  I believe it was legal in the US, but that there were plans
to change this to assist the War on (some) Drugs, and on organized
crime.  I think it's still legal here in the UK.  No idea what happens
when you cross international borders...

Hope this clears up some of the misconceptions that were flying about
here.

Now back to our regular scheduled programme...

Bzzt.  If nothing else, you can always use a one time pad
encryption, and you do not have to give anyone a copy of
the pad if you don't want to.  But this is all getting more
than a bit silly, people... a) the people who can break
moderately good codes have much better things to do than
track down raves (even *gasp* where young people might be using
drugs 8-) and b) if you have a mole within the list of people
who are supposed to decrypt the information, then the
encryption won't do any good (are you willing to bet there
are no undercover cops on sfraves?  willing to bet several
years in jail?).  Common sense says don't discuss things
in open manners that might get you in trouble.  Email is in

Right on, Rocky.  I've consciously been spreading positive vibes everywhere 
I go but especially while dancing at raves.  I thought I was the only one who
*consciously* spreads positive energy from my body outwards, but after reading
your post I realize there's been others doing this too.  I've only been 
overwhelmed\gave up at a few raves where the negativity and/or don't-care 
neutrality attitude was too much for me.  (One of them was a night at Housing
Project about 3 weeks ago.)  If you can get three people to really, really
spread positive vibes within a triangle, like have each one of the three at
one of the triangular points around the dancing crowd, the resulting energy is
far greater than the sum of the individual parts, I'm told, and I have yet to 
try this.  

Let's meet up during the beginning of a rave and try this as an
experiment.  Everyone who doesn't think this is a bunch of b.s. should try
this too, just for fun!  Doing it consciously is more fun than doing it 
unconsciously.

Weapons searches are definitely _not_ the answer.  I wouldn't go anywhere

avoiding both thugs and cops is not to overflyer and also choice of

REPLY TO 12/08/92 14:02 FROM gwh@lurnix.com: Re: Encryption Security

so i was talking to my friend who does some sort of genetic
programming for appple, and is currently being employed to see if he
can break the des security shceme without using crays. he explained
the myth about security is that some codes aren]t crackable. he said
its basically an easy thing logically to break a code. its really a
time thing that prevents anyone with less than a room full of crays
from cracking the more important allogorythms. he said the govt
works like this, when someone gets a good idea of des, or just a
good code, the
government buys a few more crays (i think they currently use 17 for
des) so they can add a few more digits into the code and not
significantly increase the decoding time.

anyway - he suggests that they]re developing a public key encryption
system in which say i want to post someone something securely, i
use the public version of an encryption scheme owned by the party
i]m posting to. they have a private key only they own which is the
way to decode the message so that while everyone could encode
something for someone else, only the person who should be able to
read it has the decoder, and because it uses two encryption schemes
it becomes significantly tougher (i.e. timely) to decode.

he also suggests people should stop investing in plastics, and start
investing in public memory systems that would function like
self-storage, but would hold things like wedding licenses or the
file that]s being rumored to be going wround {BrianNude.GIF}

oh, and if anyone has the chance to preview junior reid and the

on the subject of general security paranoia - i have almost
confirmation of the fbi putting fake ads in mags like high times.
some friends of mine who were going to el salvador to monitor the
elections a few years back got their phones tapped and a bunch o
really threatening messages obstentsably from the salvadorans. yeah
right.

also, the fbi does a lot of porn advertising (confirmed)

and remember, when you ask the fbi if they have a file on you, they
open a second one, etc...

so despite the euphoria of the ideal rave, remember the backdrop
against which it and the playfullness it depends on (i.e. drugs,
semi-legal spaces, youth, and people finding themselves dissatisfied
with certain larger elements of the american way) operate within a
mechanics of state operation not wholly convinced of its own freedom
propaganda. and if that doesn]t give you a little more kick in your
two step, i don]t know what will....  just when i]m almost out, they
try to pull me back in (michael corleone)

even if raves are attempts at non-political enjoyment by people with
no unified commitments, statist structures will still attempt to
define and control...

and the rest will just seek to consumerize the purchasable vibe

control and commodity are worse than any material freebase

Hey, is this "positive energy" or just positive dancing and friendly smiles?

What makes y'all (geoff, rocky, taxi) believe in this ethereal schtuff
anyways?  All contrivances in deed?

Maybe you're not emitting positive energy at all; rather, your rhythmic
body movements, combined with sound & echoes, lights & flashing, other
peoples movements (and faces, pheromones, sweat, funk and sex) are
triggering a physiological and neurological response. And upon feeling this,
you "get it" and "feel it"? 

It could even be some of the things Terrence McKenna talks about... Some
elaborate primal mating rituals sublimated into dance and society...  Now,
these feelings are re-emerging in an age with Lies Surging once more?
Civilization and it's Disco-Tents?

So last night's full moon turned out to be a little adventure; when
Ovid and I got to the site at around 1 it was totally empty, and
we scouted around the bunkers a little bit, observing the graffiti. 
After about 10 minutes we were about to leave and we run into Brian
and Lee and a few others; Brian assures us that this is still the
intended location, so we search around for a relatively dry and
un-windy spot where the sound could go.  But shortly afterward,
a police car comes up to the bunkers and drives around, saying
something over the car's loudspeakers to the effect of "Get out!".
People scrambled to get out of range of the headlights, and we're
separated.  Ovid and I found Lee later, but we lost Brian.  

Meanwhile, the police are at the bottom of the access road keeping
people out; we hike down the side of the hill back to John Muir
Rd where more people are arriving and wondering what's happening.
Lots of SFRavers out tonight.  By three there are a lot of people
in the streets, waiting for word of the backup plan, but Ovid and
I decide to call it a night.  

Today I call the Wicked line and they say it was moved to the 
basement of a SoMa warehouse; I guess some of you must have went,
so you can pick up the story...

The other news from the Wicked line is that there's a Jeno & Garth
Wicked this Friday night/Saturday morning starting at 2am (probably
more like 2:45) at 1015 Folsom.  (i.e. where Alternity has been)

There's another King St Garage Wicked on Saturday Dec 19th ($13).

Subject: Wanted dead or alive...a calendar  :)


   Okay, I haven't really dropped off the face of the earth.  But my
new job (part time at that) has really messed up my schedule and I'm
trying to get back into the rhythm of things and still do everything I
used to...  
   I apoligize for not getting the calendar out the past two weeks,
but to be honest, There were only about two or three events that I
knew about that I didn't have on there.

   What I can use from you all is some help getting the flyers and
info on weeklies and other events.  Even if a few people called up
just one info line and typed in all the info and sent it to me, it
would be a great help.  Joe Rice has been helping out a lot, but I
could still use some more help.  
   And San Diego appears to have almost disappeared.  The number of
events the past two weeks seems to have gone way down in SD.  So let's
hear from some of you SD people on the list.  You wouldn't want us to
think you have no scene.  :)

   On another note, as the Southern California scene changes, so does
the calendar.  Weeklies (especially the after parties - which are not
aptly named any more) are becomeing the mainstay it seems, so what I
have been mulling around in my mind is to mark certain weeklies as
recommended by the list.  Some examples would be the recently popular
King and Czar in LA, and Microrave in SD.
   If you have any suggestions as to what you think should be
recommended weeklies or after-parties, post them or let me know so I
can update the calendar.   I will also be marking the after-parties
more clearly to distinguish them from 'bar & restaurant' raves that
close early.  I guess anything that goes past 4 or 5 could be
considered an after party, but I want to know what you think.

Look for the calendar tomorrow afternoon, and keep the info flowing.

Joachim

  The previous posts about positive energy and the 'love vibe' caught my
 attention..  Does sex play any kind of role in the SF rave scene?  I mean,
 are raves conducive to meeting people and establishing relationships?

  Here in NY, it seems like the rave scene is pretty much asexual.  People
 look fairly androgynous (like overgrown kids), and sex doesn't seem to play
 any kind of role.  People mostly concern themseves with the music, and
 getting their aggression out..  Just going AWOL..

  I'm just curious.  SF seems more sensual, more spiritual than NY for some
 reason.  Can anyone who's been out here to NY confirm this?

Ok, so today I feel really practical and down to earth.  Sometimes it just
happens.  I can't help it.

Which brings me to this vibes kind o' stuff.  I love good energy.  There's
no doubt about it.  People say I have very strong energy although it's
not always positive -- not to say that's it's negative.  But that's beside
the point.

(And this is where the practical bit comes in....)  IMHO, it may be as
important or more important to reach out to people -- not with energy --
but with real, human interaction.  What I mean is smiling, eye contact,
shaking someone's hand (or ??), saying "hi" and meeting them.  Or whatever.
A lot of folks here of sfraves talk about this happening.  I dunno maybe my 
expectations are really high for our subculture, but I don't see it that 
much as would be ideal personally.  Ok, maybe it's because I've only been to 
(shhhh! don't tell anybody) two or three raves.
(Ok, stop laughing!  I'm working on it....)   And I've only sorta met a 
couple of people at one of Brian's noontime thangs, but it seems to me 
that some "what's up dude" or "what's shakin' baby" or [your fav' greeting
here] at raves, etc. would be kinda nice for newbies.  And oldbies too.

(Ok, I'll keep going.  I think another paragraph will do it.)  For those of
us that grew up with apocalyptic dread (aka the Cold War), changing
societal foundations, existentialistic angst-turned-ennui [boy, did we ever
really get into such wordy concepts??] and the like it's not exactly real
easy to drop into the scene and "get it". 

Anywho, I'm sure see see/talk/etc. you guys reaaaaal soon.

Subject: Re: Sing a little song, dance a little dance... (was Re:   spiritVibes)

I think that spreading _the vibe_ consciously is always a good idea 
when you have it to give. If I have it, I go out and give it; if I'm 
borderline, I go out and see if I can catch fire from either the music, 
the atmosphere, or (and I espcially like it when this happens) from 
somebody else on the dance floor; if I don't have it at all, I go get 
some coffee in an attempt to explore the depths of irritability. 

When I'm dancing in the vicinity of sombody whose going all-out, I can 
usually pick up whatever vibe I have and amplify it. In fact, I often 
try to find people on the floor who seem particularly enthusiastic, 
simply because that kind of enthusiasm is attractive to me. If I can't 
find this person/group of people(it's too crowded/too early/etc...), 
then I dance by the speakers or the dj table. If I do find them, then 
I try to create this bonding moment of recognition; catch their 
eyes, smile, dance harder. This often becomes a mutual thing; and we end 
up playing off of one another. When I need a break from dancing, I usually 
chill-out on the margins of the floor, watching the people who are going 
off and trying to send them my special "stamp of approval" (for lack of 
a better choice of words) vibe. I also do this to learn new steps, no 
matter how spastic or difficult, and that always gives me a good feeling; 
'cause then I've got something to take home with me and back out again.

BTW- Geoff- I never told you this, but the first time I saw you was 
last summer at 177 TWNSND- going off while the floor was still pretty 
vacuous; I remembered you from that, because you were so impressive. 
At least, I think it was you... 

I'm not sure whether it's a "physiological or neurological response"(Niels) 
or an ethereal thing(Rocky, Taxi, Geoff). Basically, I think that in 60-70% 
of their lives, most people are followers (well, the description fits me, 
anyway); people learn and modify their behavior by example; etc... On the
other foot, I think people are competitive- a kind of "oh-so-you-think-
you're-gonna-go-off-harder-than-me" mentality.

I'm impartial to the reasons why the vibe spreads/can be spread, as long as 
it keeps happening- but so far everyone seems to agree that it does take 
an effort.

Just some thoughts-

Jocelyn

maybe someday i'll go ravin' in my old cheerleading costume...

i'll bet many of us have been chanting and rhythmically pounding 
our feet on the floor, then jumping up in the air while wearing 
a damn silly outfit in many different contexts.

Comments:  The penultimate tribal label releases their first compilation.
After all the hype over Wonka Beats' divinity, I'm more than a little
disappointed in the contents.  Underneath the bamboo and the bongo, there
isn't a whole lot of innovation going on.  Not many tracks stand out as
something I'd want to return to listen to again.  The Aqua Step tracks are
definitely the best things going on this compilation.  One can only wish for
an album.

Summary: 6/10.  Short (40 minutes) and low on originality.  Word has it that
this comp isn't a very good example of Wonka Beats' music.

Comments:  One of the most remix packed singles I've ever purchased.  I'm glad
that both of these tracks are scrumptious to start with so I didn't get bored
with the whole thing.  The remixes themselves are distinguishable and well
done.  Nothing is really notable except the "Guitar Vocal Mix" which sounds a
bit like Robyn Guthrie to start with then Roddy Frame in the middle, very well
done.  The "Edit" tracks are a bit pointless since they are just shorter
versions of the mixes, but I doubt I'll ever get angry because someone put too
much music on a disc.

Summary: 9/10.  Diva laced swooping ambience with high danceability.  Good
stuff.

Comments:  A smoother than smooth collection of tribal, progressive house, and
trance.  Virtually all of the tracks are calm, but hold interesting percussion
lines and well suited samples.  Personal favorite is "The Crossing" which
samples Bulgarian Women's Choir (yet again) and builds into a wall of rhythm.
A slap on the head goes to The Drum Club who seem to really want to remix the
Orb but can't get permission to.

Summary: 8/10.  A fine representation of the three presented dance styles.

Comments:  The absolute worst piece of garbage I have heard in a long time.
The title track kicks in with all the force of Lionel Richie with Peter
Bouncer crooning about "Everybody was so happeeee, I'm raving, I'm raving."
Makes me want to hunt these people down and give them a dose of my happiness
after listening to this pathetic piece of slime.  "Runaways" and "Raps My
Occupation" only goes to prove that there is a broad line between good and bad
rap.  This unfortunately, is on the far side of the latter.  My little sister
could probably pump out a better rap than these clowns.

4   3	05:36 Firecracker - The Shamen Remix

Comments:  Each group shows their individual styles in remixing YMO.  Altern8
is quirky and fun, 808 is electric and distinct, Orb is slow with an odd
rhythm, and the Shamen turn in some standard dance fodder.  Orb's track may
seem boring, but a listen on the headphones reveals some fantastic stereo
effects.  The jacket states that all of these tracks are available on
"Hi-Tech/No Crime" so purchasing this EP may be pointless.

Summary: 7/10.  Good but this EP is too short.  More of a teaser for the
album.

2   3   06:15 Foghorn Mix

Comments:  This piece builds for a full minute then explodes in a frantic bass
and drum line.  Very reminiscent of Aphex Twin's "Digideroo".  After it gets
there though, Egyptian Empire doesn't seem to know what to do with it.  After
the second minute has gone by, we just have parts dropping in and out with a
large tone feedback thrown in for good measure.  Yet this is still a great
track, it just gets a bit boring after a while.  The remixes don't help much
since they aren't near as interesting as the original.  I would have rather
seen some different tracks.

Summary: 7/10.  This is on Ffrreedom, so it will more than likely start making
the compilation rounds.  Best to wait for it.

Subject: and now the rest of the story...


well, i'll try to pick up the story as best i can.... while everyone
was running around at the original site, avoiding cops, and having various
little adventures, i was sound asleep in brian's car.  yes, that's right, i
slept for 3 hours straight in the front seat.  I didn't even wake up when
brian asked if i wanted to meet some cops.  when i did wake up, there was a
group of cars and people hanging out in the parking lot, so we got out to
help decide where to go.  after much traveling and talk, we decided on the
basement of a warehouse where one of the guys worked.  it was at 17th and
something, i can't remember.  someone can fill in the details if they want...
anyway, we got there and proceeded to unload all of the stuff.  the space
was great.  there were different levels and a tunnel which i didn't explore 
and it was just very grrrroooovy.  there were a whole bunch of people setting
up; i wanted to help but i had no idea what to do so i ended up standing 
around feeling and looking very useless.  at first i thought there was only
going to be a small handful of us, but soon lots of people showed up.  garth
was spinning some funky good stuff (as usual!), moonpup was there, some
people dancing, etc. i got to meet some more sfravers which was very cool.
(hi guys!  or, should i be like brian and say, hi everyone! =)  we talked
about pee-wee's playhouse and i got to hear about some interesting european
clubs - it was fun.  then the cops came.  aparently there are people living
in the building or something; there were quite a few complaints.  i know i
would be pretty excited it i woke up to some serious beats below my room,
but these people just weren't into it.  the cops shut it down with very bad
attitudes.  malachi tried to talk to one of them but he wouldn't listen and
then the cop pushed him out of the way.  mr bad mood then told garth to turn
the music off and sort of hit the needle on one of the turntables.  that made
a few people upset, least of all garth.  so we shut down, carted stuff out,
and got some more attitude and menacing from our neighborly boys in blue.
the group got somewhat split up; a few of us went to the palace of fine arts
and danced under the dome for a bit.  that got cold and we left, i fell asleep
in the car again and then i was home....

oh, a funny thing happened on the way to the warehouse... we were traveling
in this caravan of about, oh, 8 cars.  we went through an intersection and
passed a cop going the other way.  well, seeing as how it was about 3 am or
so, the cop was a bit surprised.  he just stopped in the middle of the 
intersection and watched all of us go by.  he didn't follow us, luckily.  i
don't know, we thought it was funny.. =)

even though nothing really went right, i still had fun.  i think it was the
three hours of sleep that put me in such a good mood.  i was just happy to
be out doing something, and i'm glad i got to meet more sfravers.  i would 
have been even happier if i had been able to be more helpful... i wish i
could have met some more people who were at the warehouse, but oh well.  yeah,
things could have been better, but there's always next time.  hopefully i'll
be able to be in that good of a mood when next time rolls around.  anything 
is possible.  =)  sorry for the babbling up there, i'm still tired...  

always, leah

This is interesting, because I've found that by being an "idiot-in-motion" at
most concerts I can turn a dead crowd around.  Even when I'm just in the back
with a group of people I don't know, dancing is contagious.

A very generous and courageous move on his (who would like to
remain unnamed) part.  It really looked like it was really gonna
come together there, and it did, for about 45 minutes.

>  then the cops came.  aparently there are people living

The complaints came from people living
across the street.  To our credit, we disbanded in a civilized and
cooperative manner (for the most part).  As this was happenning, I
said to one of the cops, "Well, you have to admit, we're a peaceful
group, no trouble at all."  To which he replied unsmiling, "Peaceful,
but noisy."  I just said, "Yeah, well we understand, you're just
doin' your job."  I'm not sure why I was so kiss-assy, I guess I felt
that it wouldn't hurt to extend feelings of acceptance and understanding,
even if they acted like FUCKS.

> even though nothing really went right, i still had fun.

Well, it certainly was an adventure, and now as I sit at work on zero
hours of sleep, I'm left with some mixed feelings.  Maybe I'm demanding
to much from a "free" event, but considering the weather and the
blatant illegality of the site, would it have been too much to expect
some kind of a backup plan in place for the couple of hundred ravers who came
out in the pouring rain?  I felt like I was part of a group that had never
put on a rave before.  Also, was the request for a $2 donation at the
warehouse typical for FMR's?  I was happy to pay it, but I would have been
happier to have donated $5 or more for an already secured backup site.  

>  sorry for the babbling up there, i'm still tired...  

Just a little while ago, I nearly nodded off at a network configuration
meeting.  Had to pretend I was paged to get out of it.  I suppose it's good 
to test one's limits every one in a while.

The short answer is no, they're not particularly sexual,
which is one of the reasons they're so popular: there isn't
much about raving to turn-off the mainstream, as opposed to
various other little venues in SF that are more sexually
charged.

Ravers are largely contemptuous of pick-up scenes, and not
without reason.  Pick-up places tend to have really high
levels of paranoia, because if you make eye contact with
anyone you're telling them you want to sleep with them.  And
actually *smiling* at someone is practically forbidden.

Subject: FMR busted - twice




Well, between Derek's posts and Leah's you have most of the story.  We
arrived there about 11:30 to assume my usual help-make-sure-people-park
-right role... it was alternating between pouring and drizzling, so I
decided to wait in the car until the sound truck would show up to get out
and help.  So we waited.  and waited.  I had told Allen to get there
early, because unloading the equipment and getting it up there would be
a rather visible action and would need to be done QUICKLY.  I drove back
to a supermarket in Daly City - twice - to make sure they hadn't called it
off, since I wasn't even seeing any cars pass by.  Finally I heard them
put the message on the machine confirming it was there, so we went back
and waited some more. 

	I saw some people walking up the road so I stopped and said hi.
It was Lee & company.  We decided to go up to the bunkers to check it
out some more.  When we got to the top of the hill, we saw a car parked
on the road next to the bunkers.  Now, this road connects to the fire road 
where we came up - but all access to this road is locked by padlock.  
(The were planning on bringing up the sound equipment by loading it all into 
a 4-wheel drive pickup and hoisting over this phalanx near the road).  How
exactly this car got here was beyond me, because all the entrances were 
still padlocked.  Hmm.  

	At the top we met Derek and Ovid and a few others, and walked 
through the bunkers to check out locales.  The main room we had picked
was cold and much damper than I thought it would be, so we decided to
have it in a central room deep in the bunkers.  We decided to walk out
one of the exits, when we heard the distinctive clicks of a police megaphone.
We scrambled back inside, he heard us, and while most of us ran I and Stevie
decided it was silly, and walked right by the cop car.  He said, "If that's
your car you better move it".  We kept walking, and went down the hillside
back to my car.  The cop car followed us down the fire road and blocked the
entrance.  (By the way, these were state parks police).

	Meanwhile the sound truck and their entourage had arrived and were
unloading the sound equipment from the van and putting it in the back of the
pickup.  I told them cut it, the cops were already here, and that the site
was a bust.  It was pouring rain at this point.  Then the cop car came up and
pulled behind all of us, and said "Nobody leave."  Someone (not Allen, maybe
Miles)  went up and talked to the cop car.  We hurredly reloaded the van, and
it was this time when I opened the car to put my flashlight away, and asked
asked the still-sleeping Leah, "cops are here, wanna say hi?".  The cop pulled
away, and said, "okay, everyone leave NOW".  So we did - about 8 of us, 
including the sound van.  We regrouped and someone suggested 17th and Illinois,
so we caravanned over there. 

	This was my favorite part of the night, actually - remember the thread
a while ago about the mobile rave, with the DJ setup on a flatbed truck driving
through the city, playing for maybe half an hour at a site or until cops came,
and then scurrying off to a new location?  This was almost like that.  :)

	Anyways, at 17th and Illinois we found ourselves on the other side of
a lake of fresh rainwater from the location, which was underneath the 280/101
freeway on some railroad tracks.  It was then that someone suggested calling
Ammon (the producer of rhythmos magazine) and asking about the basement at his
work, near 2nd and Townsend.  We all went over and hung outside while they 
checked it out.  It looked good, so we all hauled the equip inside, hooked
it up, and were off.  When we arrived Allen had put the new location on the
number, and within an hour there were a good 100 more people there.

	Anyways, about half an hour later our boys in blue show up, and walk
over to the DJ table.  Malachi approached them, and said something, but they
either couldn't hear or didn't understand and pushed him aside.  The cop
said to Garth, "Turn it off".  Garth ignored him and kept mixing.  The cop
then got very flustered and reached down onto the left turntable and threw the
needle off the record.  Fortunately, it wasn't the playing record, so the 
music kept going.  The cop looked like he was about ready to punch Garth, and
Garth the same, but he turned the volume off and the situation de-fused.
A few yelled out and cussed, but enough others (including Geoff) told people
to relax.  The cops then started shooing people out, and we stayed behind to
help clean up.  

	Everyone was pretty much pooped after that, and figured 5:30 was too
late to try and regroup.  So everyone went their separate ways.  The rainfall
at this point was very appropriate.

	So if anyone has any info about that car that was up there (someone
said it was a stolen car, and that's why they busted the party?) or about how
the cops found out about that basement, (they said there were a lot of neighbor
complaints, except - no one lives anywhere near there!) let us know...

	I, for one, have been in a deep blue funk the whole day... ah well.
I can deal with batting .500  ;)

Well Neils, to answer your question I'm gonna say that I AM spreading positive
vibe energy, not just rhythmic body movements, facial expressions, pheromones,
etc., etc. BUT actual positive vibe *ENERGY*.  I believe it's in the form of
an electromagnetic field - don't laugh,  I'm serious.......  I'm talking about
an auric vibe here.  I'm talking about an energy that I still don't fully 
consciously understand but I KNOW it's there and I know I can control it.  I
started noting these funny "coincidences" and ever since then I've been 
experimenting with my positive vibe output.  In fact, I've even streamed 
positive vibe energy around you Neils and I've observed your reaction.  I ain't
kidding here.  You chose to react with a good deal of positive 
energy thank you.

Ok maybe it's time for me to stick my finger in a socket and see if my head

oi vei...

got there around 5AM after a late night fighting LaTeX on my latest
resume version.

wandered around all alone in the bunkers looking for signs of the party.
got spooked cuz I was hearing human/animal noises and ran outta there (it's
scary being in there all alone at 5AM with hard rain and mist blowing all
about). met up with 10 other ravers and we proceeded to do the exact tour
that i had done -- this time I felt less hurried/scared due to safety in
numbers. they were all going "but i can hear tribal beats in the distance"
and I sed -- i've been on that trip before -- it's the waves pounding.

Definitely one of the strangest 5AM experiences I've ever had.

Damn, TAXI, and just when I was about to say that postive energy exists, and is 
*made of* faces, funk and pheromones, just like speech is just vibrations
and the words you're are just pixels. Like, information is material.  It seems
like a lot of us are willing to spend hours in the rain to alter our spirits
through some very material means.  So what's the argument about here?  

Lemme put it another way; dreams and hallucinations are real, even though
the stuff in them isn't.  But maybe *I* should just go home and ask *my brain*
 about it.

Go ahead, flame me, boddyouse guys.  But the first folk to mention
"chaos", "fractals", "John Lilly", "complexity theory", or "Plato", may you
be swept down the ethereal guilt plane in a torrent of public philosphical 
regurgitation ( urp !-)).

Hi Everybody:

I was just curious if anybody knows if any big raves are planned for Xmas
night.  This will be the first year I have no family plans XMAS and am really
exited.  What I would really like to do is get everybody together who doesn
have (or want to be with) Family that evening and have a house party,  Just

Now for a completely different subject:  I am looking for the name and creator
of a song that is at the end of Moonpup's Xrated tape.  It starts with the
lireks "Follow Me Follow me"  it is very gospel like.  I really like the song
but MoonPup's tape cuts it short.

Subject: Sexual vibe at raves..

  I have felt an intense sexual vibe at SF raves,but not in quite
awhile.. It seems as if it's been a long time since any of the SF
parties Ive been to had that total "out of control" feeling that
seems to foster wild "anything goes" type of sexuality...

I'm thinking back to some of the first ToonTown's at 650 Howard
or the seminal Love scene at it's beginning... Overt sex was much
more common at rave-like gatherings then than it is now....

when house music first hit SF it was only played at the large

parties were a lot more sexually ambiguous.. Some examples from
that period might be Recess or Gus's "Crew" (a mostly gay party..but
with a great -totally out of control atmosphere..very coolly mixed after 3 or

This was the most TENSE moment I've ever experienced at a rave.  I've never seen
Garth (who is always so mellow) so angry. In a way, I admired his defiance of 
authority, (something that is always close to my heart :) but I was terrified
that the cop would lose his cool and try to arrest Garth, which I know judging
from the crowd, myself included, would not have been allowed to happen.  For
a split second I had this image of tussling cops and dead ravers but in the end Garth cut the sound, the point had been made.  And indeed he has gone up in
my esteem.

Cops always use that bullshit line when they have info from sources that
they don't want to disclose.  I'm not saying that this is not the case however.

I think this would be a great idea, with one caveat, and I'm not exactly
sure how to express this without sounding negative and closeminded.
I, and some other ravers I know, have some difficulties with organized
religion in general, and christianity in particular.  Each to their own,
live and let live, etc., but even with the best of intentions, i would
probably find any XMAS religious (in the typically saccharine and hypocritical
way imposed by western culture) references offensive.  I know I'm not
alone in this, and that  I am certainly free to leave or not participate in
such things, but I thought I'd just share this viewpoint.  For myself, there
are certain aspects of raving that I find religious in a way that would
be demeaned by the presence our society's oppressive brainwashing
approach to the spiritual realm.

Subject: The mystical material vibe


So we've got the scientific materialists (like me) vs. the
mystical psychic vibe people.

To some extent it doesn't matter which way you believe.  The
way you feel affects the way other people feel, whether the
mechanism is a psychic aura, or body language.  

But there is a difference... After the last Wicked, I was
wondering if I was being too passive.  I didn't like the
attitude much (though you know, the chill space wasn't too
bad.  It would be funny if "real ravers" chill.  Any clubber
can dance?)... 

Overall the attitude was too clubby I thought.  Could I have
worked to change it?  Being into scientific materialism
(SM?), I come up with a list of concrete things I could've
done differently.  Smile more.  Bring some large balloons to
play with.  Hang up some signs "Attitude Free Zone".
Organize some other people to mix up the dance floor.

But the funny thing is that being into SM, I have a hard
time bringing off the above ideas, I tend to be too stiff
about things.  It isn't easy to consciously control the
entire communication channel.  Am I smiling right?  What do
I say next?  This kind of approach can be paralyzing.

On the other hand, what someone like me would have to call
the "delusion" of psychic auras might be an ideal tool for
freeing up your intution, and just doing things naturally.
Maybe the best way to control the vibe you send is by not
trying to control it too precisely...

Well, more on this later (but then there always is)... 

I think I see a distinct trend in the prices of the raves,
they're definitely going down.  If it weren't for Basics
this weekend ($10 b4 11PM) I'd be thinking about checking
out Wally World ($10) or Lost in Space ($5?).

See you all (?) at lunch.  I've got some nearly finished
drafts of a "Rave Info" flyer that you can check out.

Well If this is any help Lee, most of the symbols (if not all) 
that are associated with XMAS have been APPROPRIATED by Christians
from religions that are far older and definately not organized,
at least not these days. Examples are :

		Santa Claus
		"Christmas" Trees
		Holly
		Mistletoe
		Bells, candles, Yule Logs, etc.

		About the only christmas symbol that is truely christian
		is the nativity scene and EVEN THIS IS DEBATABLE.

So when you see these things, just think winter carnival, or Birth of the
SUN, or Buddha's birthday or Yule celebration, or winter solstice or
what it's really about these days, getting those end-of year revenues up.

Hi Taxi et al--

I was in NY for a week this summer and only got
to the Pyramid Club in the East Village and a
rave in Brooklyn for my sampling of the rave scene,
but I agree with yout more recent two week sampling:
I found the sexual energy high (almost as high as 
the scene along the West River by the village
(if you've seen Paris Is Burning, you've seen mild 
doses of the sexscape scenes there).  Sorta like
Carefree at 4:00 in the a.m. (what other 4 does a
Carefree have?)  As the world's second oldest
lecherous raver/second most lecherous ol' raver--
take yer cherce--I rather dug it!  Definitely not as
spiritual, though, and that's the combo that many of
us cosmopolites have always dug about SF--the sensual/
spiritual ambiance of the City; it's like what the
Beats dug here in the 50s when I was in high school/
college--zen and psychedelics--Michael McClure, Gary
Snyder, Jack and Allen and Peter O., and all those
guys, y'know?

There is a great article in the first issue of OUT Magazine about the gay
rave scene in NY.  The sexual component definitely seems to be higher there.
Someday when I have nothing better to do (don't hold your breath, kiddies
and geezers), I may type it in for the edification and delectation of all.
I have noticed some moments when the sexual energy gets very high in some SF
venues, and to protect the few innocents who were there I won't describe
what went on at the EndUp last Sunday morning, but YOU know who you are.

Anyway, I have long been a devotee of the Greek notion of the Golden Mean;
although rather than moderation in all things, I tend toward excess in both
directions figuring that it will all balance out in the end.

You did until I came out of my head one day while sitting on a waterbed.
Seriously, I was and still am very scientificly oriented and always hated
the way science doubted anything that it couldn't prove.  I, at least, was
open minded enough to think that psychic/paranormal/alien, etc. experiences
could be real and if they were could be explained through science rather than
oppose it.  Then one day I had what they call an out-of-body experience.
Yes, I was came out of my head and went up to the ceiling and looked at my
self lying on the water bed and it scared the hell out of me - I thought I
was dying.  Ask me the story sometime if you wanna know more.  Then, I knew
that there was more of a chance that these other experience were real because
I had accidentaly proven to myself that at least one of these things was real.
And anything that is real can be explained through science.

Yeah, and the swastika was originally a symbol used by Native Americans,
but let's not get into that debate of a few months ago that occurred 
over the SFR logo.  I have learned not to cling too strongly
to my own perspectives on things, not necessarily because I'm so 
openminded, but because it would be so boring.

Ya know, thinking back to the FMR fiasco; I probably should be thankful
for the lack-of-organization/impromptu/seat-of-our-pants aspect of
raving.  Anything that is overly planned often creates expectations that
are not fulfilled, or risks turning into an exercise in protofascism.
So ultimately, I refuse to allow myself to be controlled by the fact that
I am a total control freak.

For those who are interested, following is the excerpt from the article

in OUT Magazine that I promised.  The article focuses on the gay scene;

if you're not into it, you might just skip over this message.  Flames

                    ECSTASY:  A Decade on the Rave

                          by Scott Baldinger



            In song and in dance man expresses himself as a

            member of a higher community;  he has forgotten

            how to walk and speak and is on the way toward

            flying into the air, dancing. . .  He feels

            himself a god, he himself now walks about

            enchanted, in ecstasy, like the god he saw

            walking in his dreams.



                          -FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, The Birth of Tragedy

                                                                    

      It's a warm, bright, seemingly sober Sunday morning.  You're

walking down Sixth Avenue, having just perused the goods at the flea

market on 26th Street.  As you pass a club on 20th Street, you see a

groggy-looking doorman standing long guard at the entrance, an

incongruous presence considering there's no herd-like queue, no line of

cabs blocking traffic on the avenue, as in the night.  A young man

dressed in tight jeans and a leather jacket walks up to the entrance,

talks to the doorman for a second and disappears into the Gothic

entrance.  A moment later, another interesting specimen does the same,

and then another.

      Could the club be open at this very undemimondish hour? you

wonder.  You're tempted but reluctant to follow, dressed like a schlub

as you are, your mind more focused on the daylight pursuits of

collecting 20th century dinnerware and getting to the gym.  But you take

the leap anyway.

      Inside the narrow foyer, at the top of a dark set of stairs, the

club promoter sits  Buddha-like on a stool, ripping tickets and greeting

visitors with the help of two shirtless employees in spandex.  Down in

the vestry, you find a beautiful display of fruit, both vegetative and

ambulatory; you pick and eat one of the former.  Nest to the display, an

unusual buzz of sociable anticipation comes from the coat-check line,

which you join to check your not very form-fitting parka.  Soon,

standing behind you is the Third Most Handsome Man in the World.  He is

very friendly, not the usual coat-check behavior of men of his ilk.  You

and he strike up a conversation as you bore holes in each other's eyes. 

He checks his coat, his shirt, and then his pants as well.  You take a

middle course and check just your coat and shirt.

      Back in the chapel, you the TMHMITW are having a Diet Coke until

and overly tanned, sunken-looking friend spirits him away for some

unspecified purpose.  Standing alone for a moment, you spot an

acquaintance buying tablets from a thin, short-haired man who has been

going around the room chanting, "Ex, Special K.  Ex, Special K."  You

friend looks a little embarrassed when he sees you but comes over

anyway, introducing you to another individual, whom you quickly dub the

Fourth Most Handsome Man in the World.  The FMHMITW is wearing Calvin

Klein jockey briefs and no shirt.  The two of you have met before at one

perfectly respectable and one or two not-so-respectable social events;

he's been polite but fairly reserved on those occasions.  This time he's

much friendlier: As soon as you start to converse, he brings his body

very close to yours.  A little later he puts his arms around you and

gives you a warm, deep hug.  (You are talking about Democratic

presidential prospects at the time.)  He then caresses your chest and

shoulders.  "Are you on Ecstasy?" you ask.

      "Of course," he says.

      "When did you take it?"

      "About an hour ago."

      "Were you out all night?"

      "No, I didn't go out last night.  I had a full night's sleep, got

up this morning, took the Ex, and came over here."

      The thin, clubby looking fellow walks by again.  "Ecstasy, Special

K," he says in the same low tone and intonation.

      You go to the dance floor, which is as crowded and fill with

orgiastic fervor as it might be at 4 in the morning.  Unlike most clubs,

however, you find a noticeable lack of attitude here; everyone is

dancing closely and talking with each other-on the dance floor or on the

sidelines, while the unattended few watch with a relatively bright,

eager look.

      "How many of these people are on Ecstasy, would you say?" you ask.

      "About 90 percent at least," he says.

      "Do you think Ex has changed the gay social scene over the past

two years?"

      "Come here, honey," he says, as he wraps his hands around your

chest, pulls you to him, and starts to conga.

      Next question.



                 [sections on the history of X, etc]



      Back on the Conga line.  The FMHMITW has been inviting one muscle-

bound queen after another to the dance that you and he had begun in such

exquisite intimacy a moment before.  They are all hot and sweaty.  They

are all rubbing their buttocks into each other's groins; needless to

say, they aren't speaking much.  After a while you get a little bored; a

conga line ("the Ex twist," a friend calls it) may be a breakthrough for

the solipsistic dancer from the dance--and there are quite a few conga

lines around the dance floor--but this clearly isn't the great

communication breakthrough you've been waiting for.  You leave to find

it elsewhere.

      As you walk through the club, you think about how drugs have

changed societies throughout history -- whether it was alcohol or sugar

or coffee or LSD.  You start to think about the major premise of Terence

McKenna's new book, Food of the Gods (Bantam), which is that the natural

hallucinogen psilocybin provided the missing link that spawned the rapid

evolution of the Homo erectus species into Homo sapiens millions of

years ago.  (They foraged, ate a few mushrooms by accident, and then

hunted real good after that.)  Although the thought of the modern, Ex-

popping homo making equally great strides in evolution is a wonderful

one, a visit to any club might dispel such hopes.  Ecstasy may have

helped us make our hedonistic playgrounds more humane and enjoyable, but

there are far too many conga lines, too many people with their backs to

each other, to do anything except make those places more bearable.

      The connection of our linguistic capabilities -- the Apollonian

forces of civilization -- with our deepest, most tribal feelings was the

cornerstone of Nietzsche's theory of the birth of Greek tragedy.  Today,

at a time of great tragedy in our lives, gay people are desperately

looking for a means to connect with each other, to make it work while it

lasts.  The drug Ecstasy -- contrary to establishment dogma -- may be a

valuable tool in that search.  But if we want the drug to really work,

we might have to climb down from the tree and take that long walk out of

the forest and into each other's living rooms.  [end of text]

I happened to be in Cupertino for a dinner thang, so it was just
natural for me to head on over to San Hose for the "Deep Space" at the
Oasis. 

Now normally, I wouldn't dare set foot in the Oasis (cuz it's so
cheezy), but the promise of hearing Spun and Jeno got my ass down
there. 

It was well worth the drive and the $5.00 cover, IMHO. We got there
around 10PMish to hear the last of Harry Who's set played to a
relatively sparse crowd.... then Spun came on and slowly, surely, and
methodically tweaked everybody into full raging rave action. The man
ain't no DJ -- he's a fucking neurosurgeon!

By the time Jeno (?) came on, the place was going off quite nicely,
even though, IMHO, Spun was spinning much more interesting music. By
then (midnightish), a pretty solid crowd had gathered but there was
still room to move.

Due to S.O.'s early morning work-habits, had to leave by 1:15AM or
so... Did anybody else stick around later? Supposely Shon, Thomas and
Dani were supposed to play too -- did they perhaps come on after Jeno
or before Harry Who?

Friendly crowd, little attitude, good music -- I guess San Jose ain't
so bad after all. Just people dancing and having fun. Well, I dunno, I
had a good time. Saw Pat Dote and Pete Reiter there, as well as various
folks that I keep seeing from SF events.

I, tAXi believe Pat Dote should reword the above paragraph to the following:
>>>because I, Pat Dote believe everyone is wrong,  I, Pat Dote believe no
>>>one knows what contributes to the good vibe, and if we can accept my belief
>>>and accept our .... blah, blah....
basically my point is this:  if Pat wants to claim ignorance and say that 
NO ONE knows what really contributes to the good vibe then he's welcome to BUT
Pat should SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.  Do not word your sentences to make it sound
like you are speaking for everybody because there are some who happen to think
they know more than Pat when it comes to this matter.  I hate seeing 
examples of people claiming ignorance for others - it's one of the things that
got this society so fucked up in the first place.  THis is not a flame.

Sayeth one raver:

Scientific and mystical approaches are opposite, yet a person
(like myself) can believe in both.  But I don't think science
can explain (in a really full way) any mystical experience,
such as the sending of positive vibes at a rave, because
the scientific approach is to reduce a phenomenon to its
component parts in order to understand it; a reductionist
approach.  This goes against the grain of a mystical
experience; mystical experiences are holistic; they
require attention to the whole instead of attention to
details.  So I think the attempt to explain a mystical
experience in a scientific way will inevitably fall short
of capturing the essence of the experience.

Am I making any sense?

The whole is more than the sum of its parts...

Like if I go to a rave and I'm thinking of how I look or
how to go about meeting people or how I'm dancing instead
of feeling the music and allowing to get under my skin
and merging with the scene, then I don't feel the vibe.

When you're dealing with the mind, reductionistic science just don't work.
I Never said it would.

When you're dealing with metaphisics/religion/etc vs the mind, saying
"i had an out of body experience" is irrelevant to determining whether
there is some kind of astral plane beyond the realm of normal human
perception and senses. No more convincing than someone telling me of
what they saw in a dream.

The mind is a very flexible thing. It'll twist any experience you're
currently experiencing into any belief system you're willing to
subscribe to. A mind and it's beliefs is not to be trusted, or at least
not to be taken at face value. 

People experiencing "near death" may be seeing god, or that "light"
"love"  and "uplifting" they experience could be a big hallucination
caused by neuronal malfunction, oxygen deprivation, nutrient
deprivation, etc. It's alot easier for the mind to process the feeling
of dieing into an instance of mythology that has been etched into our
heads from an early age. The mind just needs to make sense, even if
only a hallucination, out of a senseless act.

Anybody that's done enough Acid should understand just how malleable
the mind really is. The mind is a great simplifier. If we perceive
something that looks vaguely like a face, by the time the mind is
through with it, it'll be a face. That aspect of mentality goes beyond
mere perception to the entire makeup of human thought.

Any organized principle you happen to observe while alive is ultimately
a simplification of  reality that is about as important as an argument
over whether that cloud up there looks like a  bunny rabbit or satan
himself. Given limited data, limited experience, limited
intelligence... just deal with it, have fun, and allow others to  have
their own hallucinations-about-reality without japing and mocking them
too much.

Given that, I guess it's just as valid to think that you are beaming
phasers of pure love from your third-nostril as it is for one to
calculate the sum-total of feelings, emotions, sensory stimuli into a
single vector representing how you feel at the moment.

I personally disbelive in the phasers-of-love concept, and more
strongly  believe that the gestalt effects of a rave, it's
participants, and the interaction with deep-rooted human responses
(both learned and evolved) resulting from our lengthy existence on this
planet as animals and tribal social beings. But that's my personal
hallucination -- you're free to come up with your own.

 I think that the Persian Mithraic cult that preceeded Christianity boasted
a virgin birth, mangers, wise men, and shooting stars and perhaps even the
same date Christmas is celeberated on as the birthdate of Mithras/Mithrae.

I just noticed this 6 room OMNI thing from Steve Collins. (Talked

In case it's not covered.
Never go to the Omni, It's fascist!
I have been there twice, it's always terrible.
The last time was to see Thrill Kill Kult,
the sound was terrible, there are more beefy security guards than
audience. The club leave doors open, but they don't want people in there
so they have a security guard watch the door and yell at people,
shutting the door was beyond his intelligence.
They kicked people out with no warning, that was the only show
I got kicked out of, I wasn't even allowed to tell my friend with the car
what happened, so I had to hang out outside with the other people
in the same shoes, I was invited by one of them (who knows the band)
to hang out with the band afterwards, but I was with sleepy people 
(who had the car) so we had to do something else instead....

I have to strongly recommend Groove Kitchen.  Were it not for
Birth/Rebirth I'd be there tonight.  I was afraid that the last one
was going to be THE last one (Based on MykL's info from someone
(Preston?)) and I'm glad it's not.  The only reason I didn't totally
get into the last one was that I'd been up for 29 hrs. with no
chemical help when I arrived, and I was helping out with the thing, so
I basically just stood around.  Markie Mark played a marathon 5-hour
set at the last one (and I must confess I was ready for Jeno after 2
or 3 hrs) before Jeno came on, and the crowd Really got into it.  For
a late-night thing, it's fun.  The DJ list is getting better and
better too.  It's cheap, fun, and just The Right Thing To Do. :)

Subject: vibrational modes


I think I kind of blew it when I framed this as being about
"scientific materialists" vs. the "mystics", if only because
the "vs." implies that they're necessarily exclusive and
opposed to each other.  Also, it's not like I was trying to
claim I'm more scientific-than-thou or something.  I
probably should've called myself a "crass materialist"
instead.  

Anyway, I wasn't really trying to talk about this
epistemology business, I was really trying to contrast two
approaches to raving.   For instance, there's the security
problem we were talking about.  A relatively crass person
such as myself approaches this by thinking of lists of
concrete things that can be done (trying hard to be
"objective" and avoid evaluating the ideas in advance).
Like this: 

  Hire more security. 
  Work more closely with the police. 
  Cut a deal with one gang to protect you from another gang.  
  Direct diplomacy/appeasement. 
  Weapons searches. 
  Organize a volunteer force of bouncers/security.  Maybe with mace or tasers?

Now someone who focuses more on the "mystical" (or maybe
just the social dynamics of the situation) is more inclined
to come up with suggestions like ~project a positive vibe".

My first reaction: Oh, come on, give me a break.  

But that isn't really fair.  If you look at something like
the sudden increase in crime rates from the fifties to the
sixties in the United States, there isn't any precise,
concrete (crass?) cause you can put your finger on.  It
isn't like the cops suddenly gave up and went home.  So
proposing solutions like "tougher law enforcement" may not
be entirely besides the point, but it's certainly not likely
to do the whole job.  The real problem is in some sort of
subtle social changes that went down... 

So projecting a "positive vibe" may actually cut to the
heart of the matter. 

And to get back to my little list of tough, pragmatic, crass
solutions: There's none of them I feel particularly good
about, and steering some sort of compromise course between
this approach and the social/mystical ideas is pretty
difficult.  Most of the things are actually
counter-productive in some ways: weapons searches don't
exactly put you in a very postive frame of mind.  Neither do
security goons.

more assholes won't help.

Could make things more 'legit', but would garner all the restrictions
that legitamate implies.

If you are going to take this approach, why not just form your own
gang and kill everyone in other gangs? :<

Maybe seemingy ineffectual, but the only real way to try to get things done.

If anyone frisks me at a rave, I'm going to another rave.

Might as well be shotguns and 9mms.  The Guardian Angel approach
strikes me as wrong.

Me too.

Maybe.  Being sorta non-metaphysical meself, I'll just try to be nicer
to people at raves than usual (tho  that'll be hard to do legally :)

Subject: Re: vibrational modes

Okay, let me see if I can deal with Howard's input here,
without running off at the mouth too much. 

I mentioned a bunch of concrete (crass) approaches to rave
security.  It seems like he didn't like any kind of use
force to oppose force, instead favoring the more pacifistic
"diplomacy/appeasement" route.

Historically, this approach has at best a mixed record,
like, okay against British Imperialists, but lousy against
Nazis.

In our situation... if you're up against gang kids with
nothing to get out of it either way but ego boost, maybe a
little diplomacy would do the job.  Bribing them to leave
you alone sounds like something that could get expensive
quickly, though.  (And if they've been hired to attack you 
by a rival promoter... well maybe I'll keep my paranoia in
check for a moment.)

Now, *if* the problem is bad enough to start thinking about
the use of force... well, I'm coming at it from a
libertarian-anarchist sort of perspective, and as far as I'm
concerned, cops, security goons and oakland homies are all
just different kinds of gangs.  Appealing to any of them for
help has problems.  

Starting a "gang" of your own (the "volunteers" idea) has
potential problems too.  It's got some advantages, though:
hopefully you could get people who are more in tune to the
rave scene, and less likely to generate a paranoid and
negative vibe...

I can't say I like this idea, but I like it better than some
alternatives.

(By the way, the Guardian Angels get *lots* of negative
press -- just like those Korean shop owners in LA -- but
I've never heard of an instance where they made a bad
situation worse.)

Anyway, let us hope that the situation isn't bad enough to
make any of this relevant.

What King Missile song is this?  A new release?  I haven't been keeping up 
with them, but I used to love them two or three years ago.  As a matter of
fact -- (I haven't thoguht of this years -- I'm just remembering it now as
I'm typing it in) -- the last time I saw King Missile perform was in the
spring of 1990, and it was in this underground alternative club, and the 
performace was turned off by the cops becuase of complaints from the 
neighbors (yeah, right).  After they pulled the plug on the show, the 
vocalist guy did a cool acapella version of "Take Things from Work."  
It was sort of like a rave being busted up, in a way.

Hey all--
	Well, I am back in the city, and I am loving it.  Had a good weekend,
and just couldn't wait to tell y'all 'bout it.  
First off, got home early to go to Wicked down in the Bassment.  Cool
show, mellow poeple, but some good hard dancing and some great tunes
laid down by MarkieminustheMark and Garth.  Garth tore it up as usual,
and I really enjoyed the rather destructive Kliptch (sp?!) wall of 
Bass...kinda hot, though, but it was fun to look at the night club upstairs
when I checked my coat...reminded me of high school..
Friday was a great way to open the vacation (sorry people who aren't
done yet), and a fine introduction to one of my favorite raves of late,
the Finale of Basics.  Wow. 
	First off, great location.  A nice huge basketball type arena with bleachers
and everything right in downtown (is there one ) Richmond.  Cool parking,
and cool cops (yeah!) being wise security.  One of the best times was
climbing all the way to the top row of seats and looking down at our family
dancing to the just raw and wicked tunes sent out by the evil spun.  That
guy is NASTY.  Good stuff.
	I had a great time hanging out with everyone, good to meet Brian (finally! ;)),
Taxi, and all of you others sitting down in the foyer whose names I have
since forgotten (nothing personal, just chemical, I fear), and the Stevie
(singer!)  Also, nice to see Janella again...
	Greatest part was during the final techno-disco track put forth by Garth,
when they brought up half of the lights and we could see everyone's happy
worn faces, dancing hard.  Perfect.  Brilliant!  The two large circles
made by all of us joining hands was great, too.  My first time!  Incredible!
 I went to Afterlife (another first time) and was really psyched how cool
it was.  It was nice just to chill and groove to the music (ain't no way I could
fall asleep...none...) and talk to other tired dancers.
	Anyway, I ramble.  I hear the Hardkiss party was fun, and I don't doubt it.
	
  Good luck with everything, again nice to meet all of you, a pleasure, and I
hope to see all of you very soon in the near future (sort of redundant).

 Have a good week, good finals, etc.

Mike

Subject: BASICS

Basics was a tremendous rave, I think after all the talk about negativity
and "vibes" and stuff, BASICS showed me that the scene is still definitely
alive and well and growing.  It was an example of what we are capable of when
we put our minds and hearts together.  I saw so many SFraves out there like the Normals, LarryC, brian, TAXI (good work!), Rox, John.  I met some FANTASTIC
new people, the whole think was exquisite for me.  I think the high point of
the night was when the music suddenly stopped in the middle of Jeno's set,
Jenos with his usual serious smerk continued to spin, all of a sudden, I saw
three uniformed "security guards" approacihng the stage, I said to myself 
"OH shit, busted and its only 4 am!". They had flashlighs and scowels on their
faces and looked very cop like , they were polite but direct in getting
to the dj area, then to my surprise one of them got under the booth and
I guess switch a circuit breaker or something cuz the system lit up again,
It totally freaked me out to see cops/security turning that cop eneergy into
a vehicle to keep the rave alive, when the whole crowd cheered, on of the
guy's face lit up in a BIG smile, like someone hit him with a PhasEr bEam
of purE lovE :), and at that moment, I'm sure he got the Vibe (or maybe 
he got a strong whif of my phemones - sorry Niels :).  In the morning
I came out to realize that the Hall of Justice (the Police Station/Court/Jail)
was right across the courtyard from the auditorium! Wow, I wonder what they
thought of all of this. BASICS renewed my faith in the ability of some
promoters to get it right, my hat goes off to Martin and crew and to all you
others out ther who generated such positive energy with your smiles, your
dancing, your sex/funk/sweat/phemones and yes, your Vibe.


Keep it alive.

mind is an extreemely powerful thing and most schools of enlightenment
spend many years attempting to trsin the disciple into perceiving with
their higher faculties, the problem here is one of bootstrapping.  You see
the mind does not want to relinquish control, it is part of our DNA machinery
that got us where we are today, it will tell us ANYTHING to keep control, for 
you, it may be, "Don't believe/investigate/evaluate the New Age/mystical/airy
fairy crap" for me it may be "The Vibe is real" what ever realness is. In both
cases our mind wins and we are controlled by our explanations and reasons for
occurences of the unknown. The problem is like that of light, since we percive
EVERYTHING through out mind, there is no escape, maybe yes maybe no.
The ultimate goal of Zen is to give the practicitioner an experience of
the "Void" or no-mind. I think at raves, someof us might get to peek at
this experience but we have not had it en mass.  Unfortunately organized
religion, especially Christianity here in the west, has really did a number
on peoples ability to think and also to go inward to look for the truth.
Since the church told you that what they say is the ONLY truth and you
deep in your soul KNOW this to be a BIG lie, I think you might be lumping
the "technology" together with the people who controlled it, conceled the
most useful parts and told you that if you wanted to use it, you had to go
throuh them.  There are other games in town.  Although like the best raves,
they don't have big glossy flyers you have to seek them out, the first step
is to acknowledge that they even exist.


	I hope you don't take this as a flame or criticism,  I grew up as
	and still am a rationalist, I guess the difference is that I believe
	that reasoning about the nature of the universe is like Law.  If you
	have a Perry Mason you can prove/disprove anything by the power and
	manipulation of reason alone, in my book, reason is a tool not the
	end product.

	I would say that there are two paradigms that create/sustain/distroy
	the universe, reason and rhyme, let the good times roll.


	Maybe we should sit down off line and really get into this discussion

I sorta went to Wicked on Friday.  I say sorta cuz I was only there for maybe
45 minutes.  The boy-in-a-leather-jacket (tm) I was with was all pooped out
and wanted to leave.  Can you imagine, dancing for only six hours and pooped
out??  (We went to a couple of clubs before hand.)  Anyway, whomever was 
spinning at about four was way kewl.  Who was that??


And now for something really different....

Someone said:

>concerned, cops, security goons and oakland homies are all

*Mount soapbox*  

Uh, it seems to me that this is a generalization.
Maybe I don't have the requisite anti-
authoritarian frame of mind but cops, for example, _are people_.  There are
some of them that are dicks and some that are not.  And for the most part,
I think that anyone who risks their life for our collective safety and makes 
a fairly measly amount of salary for it, I have
to give that man/women some credit.  That's not to say I like them messing with
my fun.  And I don't always agree with their behavior.  One of the things
I noticed different from Dutch cops (and some other European cops) from 
American cops (although I don't
want to generalize :-), is the cops here have a tendency to think in terms 
of law enforcement (enforcing the law) because that is what they are taught  
rather than in protecting the welfare of people in the spirit of the law
(which is what Dutch cops are taught).  These two things often are at odds with
one another.  On the other hand, the sometimes ridiculous restrictions on 
processing real criminals through the justice system makes the cops want to 
"do it when they can".  I say this because I've talked to cops and one of my
brothers was a police cadet and was out there.

Btw, kinda related and kinda not, this reminds me of an essay/editorial in this 
Sunday's Chronicle by A.S.Ross (?? I think) which I thought was really good
albeit a bit on the "conservative" side.  "Are we a nation of victims?"  He
has a good point.  We have a tendency to blame others (usually authority) 
when something (anything) doesn't work out.  Everything from losing our
national manufacturing competitiveness (just because unskilled, entry-level
UAW jobs in Detroit _start_ at $18.75 an hour has nothing to do with it
(and the cost of living is _half_ what it is here))  to 
our poor relationships ("I'm 
Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional" or how my family screwed me up) to 
my favorite free, left press homily "we
live in a fascist police state" (yeh, almost like Mussolini's Italy, etc.) and
so forth and so on.  

I dunno.  Maybe I'd rather work within/around/overthrow a system than complain. 

* Dismount soapbox *

Hey all--
	Well, I am back in the city, and I am loving it.  Had a good weekend,
and just couldn't wait to tell y'all 'bout it.  
First off, got home early to go to Wicked down in the Bassment.  Cool
show, mellow poeple, but some good hard dancing and some great tunes
laid down by MarkieminustheMark and Garth.  Garth tore it up as usual,
and I really enjoyed the rather destructive Kliptch (sp?!) wall of 
Bass...kinda hot, though, but it was fun to look at the night club upstairs
when I checked my coat...reminded me of high school..
Friday was a great way to open the vacation (sorry people who aren't
done yet), and a fine introduction to one of my favorite raves of late,
the Finale of Basics.  Wow. 
	First off, great location.  A nice huge basketball type arena with bleachers
and everything right in downtown (is there one ) Richmond.  Cool parking,
and cool cops (yeah!) being wise security.  One of the best times was
climbing all the way to the top row of seats and looking down at our family
dancing to the just raw and wicked tunes sent out by the evil spun.  That
guy is NASTY.  Good stuff.
	I had a great time hanging out with everyone, good to meet Brian (finally! ;)),
Taxi, and all of you others sitting down in the foyer whose names I have
since forgotten (nothing personal, just chemical, I fear), and the Stevie
(singer!)  Also, nice to see Janella again...
	Greatest part was during the final techno-disco track put forth by Garth,
when they brought up half of the lights and we could see everyone's happy
worn faces, dancing hard.  Perfect.  Brilliant!  The two large circles
made by all of us joining hands was great, too.  My first time!  Incredible!
 I went to Afterlife (another first time) and was really psyched how cool
it was.  It was nice just to chill and groove to the music (ain't no way I could
fall asleep...none...) and talk to other tired dancers.
	Anyway, I ramble.  I hear the Hardkiss party was fun, and I don't doubt it.
	
  Good luck with everything, again nice to meet all of you, a pleasure, and I
hope to see all of you very soon in the near future (sort of redundant).

 Have a good week, good finals, etc.

Mike

friday: nothing.

saturday: birth/rebirth (the hardkiss anniversary party/scott hardkiss
birthday party thang).  even though i am getting mighty sick of king
st garage, i went to this party.  we arrived around midnight to hear
jeno spinning a very un-jeno-like set.  i am most curious to know what
kind of stuff he did at basics cos this was well funky.  he played
that brilliant "hear the drummer get wicked" track and then i knew
that this was going to be a rave to remember.  i was in awe.  as a
little background, you have to know that i am getting pretty damn sick
of the usual josh/jeno/garth axis.  they're great, but i'm bored of
their style.  to hear jeno break out of his mold like this was quite
inspirational.  and speaking of inspirational, the next dj was jon
williams ("LA's maverick son" as the hardkiss hype has it).  my word,
this guy is phantastique.  godlike with a capital "ohmigod!"  i can't
even begin to describe what he did to my head other than that it was
unbelievable... and i can't wait to hear him spin again!

next up, mark farina from chicago.  he was interesting as well
although after the brain mangling i got from jon williams, it was
a bit anticlimactic.  he also teetered on the edge of divaness from
time to time.  fortunately, he filled in the gaps with some kickin'
acid jazz.

scott and robbie took over after mark for some of their patented tag
team techno turntable technique.  i love the stuff they play and this
set was no exception (well, they did play one of my least favorite
orbital tracks).  they stopped the show halfway in and brought out a
cake.  robbie got on the mic and asked that everyone sing happy
birthday to "my best friend in the whole world", scott.  we all did
and it was uniquely touching.  scott blew out the candles, everyone
applauded, and robbie slammed the music back in.  a very sweet scene,
all told.

after the rave ended, we headed over to 150 folsom for the after
party, but the guy with the key was nowhere to be found.  after
waiting for a few minutes, we decided to go to DNA to see if we could
locate a friend who had gone to basics.  at this point, some of our
party went home to sleep, but i continued on.  we got a lift over to
150 folsom with mark from ameba and found just a few hangers on left
listening to alfie and the hardkisses playing some records.  i hung
out a bit, talked to a few people, and eventually headed on home.

a long and entertaining stretch of partying that culminated in 14 hrs
of sleep.

I tried a bit of channeling for a while at the Hardkiss party.  I don't know
about the complete success, but I do know that a couple of potentially nasty
incidents were averted.  Like when I spotted three cops wandering through
the party -- one of them observed "something" being passed.  The cop
confronted one of the persons involved, but instead of busting him, the cop
spotted the cap on the floor, stepped on it and then left.  Not the ultimate
solution I would have hoped for, but better than jail.

I too had to take a break to clear and reground.  Perhaps my newness to this
raised my ego involvement also.  But overall, I felt wonderful, positive
energy for most of the night.

Cheers to all.

Geoff, Niels, and Others--

I think we've had another good discussion going,
with the kind of basic views coming out there that
I'd never expect to be going on a board that was
"just" about music.  To me it shows that many of the
people here are obviously interested (even if they
disagree with each other and get disturbed about the
volume of mail) in the larger and deeper issues of life.
Quite frankly, that's the vibrational energy that 
attracted me to raves--that's precisely what psy-
chedelic culture is at this point of our evolution--
and it hasn't been an element in popular culture for
about ten years (since, say, around the time of new
wave).

Psychologically, we are about where the new physicists
of the 1920s were with their discussions of the basis
of reality: particles, waves or wavicles?  Certainly,
there are elements there (particles), much like the
rational blocks of stuff that govern our societies 
and their structures (law, education, medicine, etc.),
but there are also the irrational (waves) that move us
as in raves and the synthesis of these are wavicles,            
creating new paradigms.  

We are at a stage in both our species and societal     
development that unless we use our higher critical/
creative skills we will not survive; we all know this,
even though we may argue with what it means (how's
that for a generalization?).  We are drawn to dance
as humankind has for eons because in the spirit of
movement we will be moved and move to  where we are
going; it's that attraction that we share.  And, unlike,
say a more technical discussion group, we will always 
keep coming back to testimonials, manifestoes, salons,
synergy, symbols, syllabi, synchronies, and symphonies,
all those synthesizing things, like Plato in his metier
we are one, the dance and dancer at once and as we dance
more we'll see more; as the words don't work we'll go
back to dance more for re-inspiration!

World's wavicle raver,
Will

	Hey everyone.  I hope that you all had as good a weekend as I did!  Basics
was the most fun I have had in a long, long time.  Wow....  I finally met
Brian (B - you are a cool dude), as well as Taxi, and a couple others (sorry,
i forget names :( ).  Good to see you again, Mykl.
	I went with Mike to the Friday Wicked in the basement at Folsom street, which
turned out to be quite a good warmup for Basics.  The atmosphere was pretty
tame, with Markie and Garth tearing it up.  That place sure does get hot,
though....
	Basics was so much fun for me.  I liked the space alot, and, despite the sie
of the crowd, the vibe stayed strong and friendly.  The music was blowing my
mind; Spun absolutely destroyed me.  Incredible stuff.  Garth's funky
techno-disco song at the end was so hilarious and fun.  When the lights came
on halfway through that song, it was so cool to see everyone's smiling faces
as the party ended.  A night to remember.

	Take it easy everyone, and I'll see you at Wicked on friday, and definitely
at the Gathering on New Year's.

Although this is a good analogy, I think that pretty soon it's going to go
a step further.  I've been doin' some thinking (uh-oh) lately about some of
the mental experiences I've been having at raves (and other places), and I
have become convined that the tenants of quantum theory can be directly
applied to the mind itself.  From a classical point of view, the mind would
seem to simply be located in the physical brain, in a specific state, at
a specific moment in time.  But just as Quantum Mechanics has shown that
the state of a particle (position & momentum) can only exist as a 
probability wave equation, it would seem reasonable to expect that the same
would be true of the mind itself.  The more one aspect of a "particle" is 
known, (say it's velocity, i.e. it's place in time), the less determinant 
another aspect of it can be known (like its position in space).  During 
those moments at raves, when time seems to stand still, when my awareness 
is completely absorbed in the moment of NOW, one can say that it's element 
of time is so well defined, that due to it's quantum mecahnical nature as 
dictated by Hiesenberg's Uncertainty Principle, its location become much
more indeterminant (i.e. not necessarily in my brain).  This would seem to 
open up the potential for lots of neat stuff like fields of consciosness 
that can interact outside the "normal" realms of the physical senses.  

So, all you materialistic skeptics out there, stop thinking in the mode 
of 1920 science.  My guess is that pretty soon, certain aspects of the 
new agey spiritual psychic energy stuff that people have been sensing will
soon be solidly supported by all kinds of complex mathematical equations,
thus making it "real" for everyone.

Subject: My Wally World Wack off


I ended up going to Wally World because my girlfriend was able to sell her
jewlery there. After not being called back by the promoter to tell her when to
show up and where to go, we went to where generic anouncement message told us,
16 and Harrison.  The location was truely a Virin Warehouse and was a very good
setting for a rave.  It was quite a shock when we got there and told security
that we were selling jewlery.  They were friendly and immediately contacted
Wally. Once we were inside (They let a couple of us non vendors in free because
we were helping cart the stuff) the people working the rave were very cool in
helping us find the vendor location and set up.  This was very suprising, we
were expecting them to not be very helpful since they did not answer there
pages quickly and we had be doing work all day to prepare for selling Jewelry.

As I said the location was cool it had two seperate dance areas with large
screen visuals and cool lasers in each space.  There was an upstairs for
chilling and vending but it was closed by the Fire Marshall.  The downstairs
also had some very cool chillout areas. 

I ended up just hanging in the chill space next to our vending booth which had
its own little space where we put the couch cushions from the couches from the
closed upstairs.  

I did not like the crowd at all it was a typical commercial rave with alot of
non ravers, people pushing and shoving with ciggerettes in your face. I am too
use to the King street garage with everybody being very cool.  There seemed to
be alot of gangster looking people which I accepted for a commercial rave with
$10.00 admission before 11.

All in all it was an interesting experience.  My girlfriend didnt make much
money but we didnt have to pay to get in either.

I'd like to, at this time, publicly retract this statement.  Rocky, Joclyne,
Mykl and a few others reminded me of a few things that "knew" but had
forgotten.  I think I'm overdue for a hallucinatory experience in the

I should have said that everything has a potential explanation, which gets so

Anyway, I'd like to reiterate my original point which was that after I had
this experience at age 14 that I had always known to be "metapysical", I 
started to realy believe that other "metaphysical" events were more likely
possible than I had formerly believed and that these events that do occur
would have scientific explanations to them.  This is just personal
experience, I wouldn't expect anyone to believe my story anymore than I
would have believed there's but I know that without trying to do this, it
happened to me, so now I know that people can go out of there bodies.  I'm
still waiting to be abducted by aliens and to be able to bend a fork with
my mind though. ;-)  And when asked: "How do you know that it wan't a dream
or vivid hallucination?"  The only way I can respond is to ask: "How do you
know reality isn't a dream or vivid hallucination?" or "What if it was and
still is and your in my dream asking me this?" or "What if your all androids
here to please me, the only human on the planet?" or ..... 
Where do we draw the reality line?  How can we be sure of anything?

Please, don't.  Explaining reality in a systematic and structured way
is the primary and only purpose of science.  The pitfall of science is
when scientists lose the fact that they are 'explaining' reality, and
begin to believe that science 'defines' reality.

That's exactly the point: finding a reproducable way to explain
natural phenomena.  The fact that it is a granted is unfortunate,
because it implies that although everything is explainable, it need
not be *rationally* explainable and thus kook hypotheses are as
acceptable as those derived rationally.

> Where do we draw the reality line?  How can we be sure of anything?

Look at metaphysics and compare it to trying to explain radio wave
propagation to a letter courier from the previous century.  What we
don't understand will always be much more mysterious and otherworldly
than what we do understand.

TAXI here,

I'm not an android either, BUT my body is a humanoid slave of my mind (which I 
like to call my "soul").   In effect, my body is like a support system in the
world of matter (we call Earth) where my soul can live out its fantasies.
This world always was and will be until its upcoming *HUGE CHANGES*, a 
fantasy-land of mine.  Pretty fun, huh?  I never actually had to go to 
Disneyland - this "reality" is enough of a fantasy land for me!!!!!!!!!

having fun in my fantasyland that we call, 'reality'......

TAXI

             seriously.

i like the music.  there are two reasons i go to raves - to hang out
with and meet cool people, and to dance to the best and most exciting
music happening right now.  most whistle blowers have no sense of
rhythm and it always seems like they're blowing it right in your ear
during the best part of the best songs.  i've been quite pleased to
see the whistle blowing (and the even more obnoxious compressed air
horn) fad dying out of late.  good riddance, i say.

Look at the bigger picture.  Not every cop and probably actualy very few
are doing it for concern for your safety and general humanitarian aid,
although it is one of the factors and they like to make you think that
that's THE reason they're doing it.  Most trades attract certain types of
people for reasons that aren't too difficult to figure out if you think
about it.  Use a little basic psycology and try to figure out the type of 
people that like to be cops.  Many just like an excuse to use/abuse power,
some see themselves as in some sort of holy war and the act of fighting bad
is more of the reason than protecting good, some just like to be assholes
and like that feeling of legaly being one, some are just addrenaline junkies,
many are social outcasts, etc.  I apreciate the protection I've had from
police but I have to be honest, most encounters I've had are not pleasant
and I'm not a bad guy, not real bad anyway.  I hate to generalize but I also
have to be honest, I think there are more asshole cops than good ones, or it's
at least equal.  I mean haven't you all noticed that we all report to each
other when the cops are cool like it's some strange event?

Subject: whistles

in defense of whistles...

my favorite part of raves has always been the interaction between the dj's
the crowd and teh music

people yelling howling clapping stomping singing playing sax's blowing whistles
 speaking in tongues... whatever

i think that it is really cool,

when it works

now i agree taht a lot of people who blow whistles are pretty annoying
but when they have rhythm and they can have this cross-huge fucking warehouse
communication system going its kinda neat

its also kinda neat when it does a nice round where it goes in a huge 
circle aroudn the warehouse

same thing goes for yelling howling, etc etc

the best part about a lot of techno is that you can see stuff like this
end up being sampled or a dj technique being reproduced on records

a lot of songs have back beats or back spinning type sounds in them
because dj's did it, it sounded good, so hell why not beat
the dj to his job and do it in a song

a lot of songs also try to make it sound liek it is a live recording
with yelling (ie Utah Saints) whistles, etc...

why? cuz it sounded good..

im not saying that whistles cant be annoying...
hell in san diego we made the rule
'no whistles in the park'

admittedly it was because the only person with the whistle
blow it hard and loud and when you are groovy to house/ambient music
in a park it _just_didnt_fit_ but with some harder techno i think it does

(maybe there is a personality connection with whistles, cuz the guy
wasnt too nice either which kinda made it hard to accept the 
whistle blowing anyhow... but he did have his claim to fame
that he helped out with toon town.. i was one of two people to
know what he was talking about, so he kept bragging about it alot)

(damn sfravers fucking up our scene down here :-)

(dont ask me why i am saying i think so much.. cuz why the hell would
i write it if i dont think it ya know?)

not that i have a point but if i did it would be that crowd interaction
with each other adn teh music is a great communal thing that whistles
can be a part of

it treated with care

remember: you should never do anything that you havent fully researched
yourself...

The aforementioned "Raving I'm Raving" piece of shit uses this to the maximum.
I can only wish that they would have gotten RID of the crowd noise on N-Joi's

   That's what I like about the live stuff from the Orb (at least, that I've 
heard).  No crowd noise...  it's too distracting.  Actually, there's one CD
that is all live, and has a very low level of crowd noise that actually sounds
good...  Adamski's Live and Direct...  There's an announcer in the background
of about the first 2 seconds of one song, and he says "Are you ready for 
Adamksieeeeee!", but it's really subdued (i.e., you can only hear it with 
headphones).

Yeah, Steven Hawking is amazing when he goes off. Quantum limbs
flapping in a seemingly random fashion pulsate to the beat with perfect
synchrony. His head, normally akimbo on his shoulder, occasionally pops
into a gyranting halo of partial differential equations. Chicks on
ecstacy totally dig his voice box, which he cleverly disguises as a
fractal trip toy. Totally technofuturistic. Cross between Jesus-Dada
and Dr. Strangelove. Yep that man can rave!

Actually, I prefer to think of my self as a self-employed raver. Hey,
if they (HP) offered you over a years salary NOT TO WORK, you'd
voluntarily unemploy yerself too. It looks like I have a long-distance
contracting deal being lined up w/ NASA and a few other potential
contracts. I just want to be able to make enough money to allow me to
tax deduct my life, set up a home office, start my own business, etc.
I'll probably be poorer than I am right now,  but I won't have to deal
with as much bullshit politics, so called management, etc. Fuck the
yuppie track. There's only so much ass-kissing I'll put up with for a
lousy yankee dollar.

So I guess it's time to move on after 7 years here. Besides, the
fuckers cancelled a totally cool project, and have nuked all the cool
user interface work here...  because it was all too futuristic and too
cool for the fat, balding, white, protestant, myopic, fortran-loving,
software hating, 55-year-old conservatives, that seem to run this
place. (Can't take any risks with that newfangled software stuff while
they're just biding time till they can retire with their fat-cat
bennies.)

So I guess interesting times call for interesting measures. (and I thought
the recession was ending).

Subject: Future Forum

I was speaking to Mark Metz this evening.  He's involved with some
people who have a very cool warehouse space off of Bayshore Blvd.
here in S.F., and he's trying to put together some sort of art /
performance / party collective that would operate out of there (this
is where Cumulus ended up the other weekend).  The general concept is
to extend the cultural side of the scene, and focus some of the
energies that are emerging out of it.  His working title for this
project is Future Forum.

Mark's got a ton of ideas -- there would be spoken word nights with
poetry and/or word jazz and/or invited speakers (he mentioned people
like Shulgin and Tony Serra), workshops in arts such as lasers, sculpture, 
and/or clothing design (his specialty, being the owner of Ameba on
Haight St.), a techno recording studio (there are already some
people with equipment set up there), drumming circle nights (anyone
with a drum gets in for free) and so on.

There would also be regular parties held there, but mostly only for
supporting members, who would pay a very small annual membership and
commit to volunteer there for a few hours a month.  There might be
occasional "open-house" events open to the public as well.

It sounds like this could be to the rave scene what Klub Komotion

Mark is holding a meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) night there at 9pm,

I'm having this sorta house-warming party in SF this Saturday and ya'll 
are invited.  

Assuming it's not too packed (which I don't think it
will be), there'll be a nice area to dance, a bunch of regular hang space 
and a chill area downstairs.  There's also a yard if you want more chill :-).  
I was planning on playing some techno, a little technoindustrial 
(aka EBM/whatever) and some Weird Stuff (depending on who's there) but I'm 
easy.  If someone wants to bring music, I have a CD, dual 
cassette player, and a turntable.  Of course if somebody is _really_ motivated
and wants to DJ and bring his/her own equipment.... 
 
Also, I have three TV/monitors hooked up
to two VCRs so you cats and chicks can bring some videos too if ya want.
(The scary part is that I _normally_ have three tvs and two vcrs hooked up;
it's not just for the party.)
I have a Hyperdelic video for one tv and Weird stuff for one of the others.
Also, I'll have some fruit, snacks and some Power Punch, but how knows how
long that will last?  So it never hurts to BYO?.

I figure the party will be from 10-2 give or take.  The address is 
122 Stillings @ Congo in the City.  That's in the Glen Park district which
is in the southern third of the city.  Due to the awesome foresight of our
municipal planners, there are completely different directions whether you
are coming from the south or north.

hi lee!
well, i agree that there seems to be some parallels between 20's physics
world and 90's muzak/social world. but the parallel with qm might be pushed
a bit too far. it is believed and the physical theory so far supports the idea
that quantum behaviour occurs only at very small scales, like the size of
the atom. at distance scales larger than that classical physics works very well
and is the appropiate method of doing physics. there ARE some large distance
scale quantum effects, but they are few and far between: superconductivity
is one example, and there is a purely quantum effect in electromagnetism
called the aharonov-bohm effect, which says that the magnetic potential
around a region of zero magnetic field gives an measureable effect in the
form of a phase which depends on this magnetic potential. as to whether the
mind has quantum nature, this is harder to say, tho' john hagelin at
the maharishi univesity - yes, the tm guy's uni. - believes that there is
some connection between quantum physics and consiousness. but this still
just theoretical speculation. i would be interested in a REAL test of
such an idea. there DOES seem to be sonme type of collective behaviour
at raves which might be related to quantum physics. but it could also
just be collective classical physics as well.

If anyone cares I'm going to be doing my debut as a radio DJ
on KZSU (90.1 FM) this Thursday night (technically Friday
morning) in the 3AM to 6AM slot.  I'm probably going to be
focusing on techno/industrial, but mostly I'll just be
playing whatever seems to make sense at the time.  (Really,
I plan on focusing on technical errors and speaking in a
flat monotone, presuming I don't turn the transmitter off by
accident.  So this could be amusing...).

The rave kids on KZSU this Tuesday were announcing some new
club in Oakland, at 811 Washington Blvd.  One of the big
selling points of the place is that it's within a block and
a half of the police station... "A *safe* environment".

I am just interested to hear people's opinion on the subject of a recent 
trend for certain popular Dj's to demand outrageous sums of money.  These
Dj's have been able to do this because they offered a large sum from one 
group of promoters.  My opinion is that if you commit to play for someone
you should play that party no matter how much you've been offered to play
for someone else subsequent to commiting.  What I would really like to 
hear is how much people think Dj's should be paid and what you all think 
is to much and to little.  thanks.

If I could get $100 each time I DJ'd, I'd be a happy clam.  The problem isn't
greed, the problem is the fact that I spend upwards of $300 a month on music.
I'd also like to add more equipment, but out of my day job, this takes a
while.

I think paying a DJ like Sasha or Frank DeWulf a sizeable amount ($1000+)
isn't too much of a stretch.  Pay scale should go with talent, but rarely
does.  Look at the majority of radio DJs who can't mix worth slop but have
"name recognition".

Hmm... I don't think it's unreasonable for DJ's, if they play at events at the
Concourse for example or another huge affair, to expect say $500 for playing
for 2 hours.  Maybe more. Carlos once told me he spends $200 a week on records.
Mainly because:  paying them more for the big for-profit affairs would make
them more amenable to playing the small for-fun raves for less money or free.

BUT

Paying a DJ more so that he would drop one party in favor of another is 
downright dirty.  Nix on that idea!

Yes, this is what I would call the classical view of quantum physics:

  Big scientist tries to observe teeny weeny atom where the limits of
  measurement invokes the small scale quantum nature of said atom.

But let's say an intelligent atom tries to observe itself, and equally
restrained by the same laws of physics (i.e. the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle), is forced to contend with its own quantum nature, which 
relative to it is *not* a small scale thing.  This is what I think happens
under certain conditions when our minds experience a special kind
of selfawareness, induced perhaps by music that resonates with our psyche
in some way, or some kind of trauma (near death experience), or other
forms of altered states of consciousness.   And perhaps by being in the
vicinity of other minds that are also invoking their probability wave 
fields, a kind of interaction takes place, like wave interference patterns 
where wave energy is exchanged, combined, or whatever.

>there DOES seem to be sonme type of collective behaviour

But we already know that classicle physics is just a useful approximation
of the underlying quantum physics that has already been scientifically 
verified by experiment.

	Quantum behavior only occurs at very small scales and there is no
reason to believe that QM is responsible for a good vibe at a rave.  It is,
however, an interesting idea to run with . . .
	If our minds are QM in nature and being in the same place 
with other minds increases the probability that all minds involved wind up in 
the same state -  then we are bosons.  This would make raves lifesize examples
of bose condensation.	- Dave

Subject: Re:  Money Dj's

As the good DJs emerge, the word-of-mouth for their value starts to
spread.  There's no question a great DJ set can make a relatively
mundane event into something to savor.  So, as in Carlos' case, if
what the organizer pays him is going in part to keep a roof over his
head, and in part to keep the new sounds flowing, it's very appropriate
to provide a decent wage scale.  Djs in the r*** sceen are making
ephemeral, one-off *fine art* and there's no question our society
undervalues the worth of realtime creation of whatever . . . 

I think it's pretty well known who's a solid, reliable and innovative
DJ, but it's not a casual thing.  It really *is* a kind of interactive
performance with the audience, and it surely takes a lot of (enjoyable)
work to figure out how to pull it off.  And it's also no problem
separating the pretenders from the truly devoted in the DJ ranks.
It's something beyond the hype of 'who's the DJ at such'n'such an
event.

Future Forum Report

If your into warehouse artist collective/rave party production/tekno-
industrial type of playhouse then the Future Forum may be for you!

Spearheaded by Mark Metz, this potential scenario has a real facility waiting
to be used.  The warehouse itself is being managed at present by the son of
the owner and seems to be available as long as things are happening and the
rent is paid.  I was lead to think that the circumstances are a little
sweeter than dealing with perhaps a property management service should a
worst case situation occur.  

Mark postulates that this collective would have a membership of 50-100
persons paying about $20 amonth dues and volunteering a few hours amonth for
full privilege access to resources of the collective.  Now don't forget the
owner's son whose name I forgot (oops) is still doing his parties and stuff
there too and will have to supplement this monthly rental of $4000 amonth 
(ding me good if I got that figure wrong).

As things progress here, open house parties would happen perhaps on a monthly
basis and of course would gather momentum as they progressed further easing
the overhead.  These parties would be designed to provide a quality
experience at an affordable price to the attendees.  

So basically the meeting comprised these things plus the meaning of rave
dialog that we all know and love here on the net.  Hopefully we can look
forward to a continuation next week and address some logistical items like:
building security, property insurance for equipment and tools, and how to
"prime the pump" in so many ways.

Once the ball is rolling everyone will want to be on board I'm sure, but who
wants to be the first to pay $20 a month and move their gear into an empty
warehouse?  

There is a cool sounding Sun. nite party there from 12 am till 6 or
something.  That maybe a good place to start.  The site may provide a good
space for SFRAVE events also.  Mark also implied that the Exploratorium and
Survival Research Laboratories may want to help sponsor some of this stuff if
they see a demonstrable scene happening there.

So what can be said of all this?  Let's see if Mykl G. or Michael Wertheim
have a response and if any other SFRAVERS show up next week.

it is just one person trying it out, I try to encourage it
if they have something going...

And personally, I LOVED the airhorns at Destiny and even
the one blast at wicked.  The Destiny dude did it near the
speakers, aiming it straight up, not blasting any one person
out of they way...he did it so well with the music that
my friend thought it was part of the song...

I guess I am biased because I like to yell a LOT at raves...
whoooooo and yeaaaah are awesome...you know it was good when
you go so long on one breath you feel like your gonna pass out
due to lack of oxygen...

brilliant!

mike

where should my friend from PA who has not raved since
Jamarave (ouch!!)and us go??  We were going to go to WICKED,
but the talk lately has been that it is filled with attitudes
and lame-o stuff like that...

And the Global Rhytmn Festival looks just TOO BIG...

I saw a 1/4 page ad for SUPERNOVA in the Bay Guardian..
that is probably old news, but I am just getting back
into my San Francisco SWING, people..

take care..

Someone let off an air horn at the last BASICS and it was great,
they only did it once or twice that night, right at a time when the crowd
was really getting into it so I liked it.  If they had kept it up though
it would have become lame real quick.

I am personally baffled at why raves cost $20 out there.  It could only be one
reason, THEY CAN CHARGE THAT MUCH AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

The Communion tour probably cost the promoter in SF $5000, and a percentage up
front.  I got it for a bit cheaper, but only because there was a limited
amount of time to get it here and the people in the tour _really_ wanted to
come here for some reason.  The Prodigy/Moby thing is going for $7500 for
large cities.  They offered it to me for $5000 on a SUNDAY and I promptly told
them where to jump.

But this leaves the cost of the sound and the lights out of the picture.  For
Communion, we had a RIPPING piece of sound, with two techs, 30K of JBL's, two
mixers, a ton of monitors, compressors, and other garbage I know nothing about
and it cost $800.  Lights can run you about the same, but if it is a club that
already has lights, then there isn't a cost.  I was looking for 350 people to
show up for Communion to break even at $15 a ticket.  That didn't happen.  I
think there were probably a few more people than 350 at the SF show.

As for raves, the one we spent the most on was the last one and it was still
only about $2200.  That included $100 that I paid Eric for coming out.  Where
these raves get budgets in the 10K 20K and 30K's, I have no idea.  I would
have guessed Shamen at Spruce Goose would have cost about 15K-20K, but there
were about 5000 people at that, which means about 100K.

If I charged $20 for a rave here, about 10 people would show up.  Realize this
is a town where The Orb cost $3 and 100 people showed up.  PWEI was $8 and 60
people showed up.

Frankly I would rather go to a rave in a good space and a crowd that I will
enjoy being with that one with top name DJ's.  I still dont know alot of DJ's
and I think that there is to much hype being put on them, keeping smaller
lesser known DJ's (Who probably are good) out.  I am not a musician or DJ so I
probably dont notice the smaller details  of the DJ's like others, I am sure
there are others like me though.  

I know I like Garth, Spun, Jeno, and Moonpup, becasue I like their style of
music (more progressive house).  I have gone to raves or heard DJ spins that
are complete nonamers and Have loved it too, because they played the type of
music.  I have also been to Raves and have been disappointed with Jeno's choice
of music.

Dont get me wrong I think that big name DJ's deserve the credit and to be paid
well but I also think that more lesser known DJ's should be given a chance to
promote themselves and allow for throwing a rave with low cover charges

The type of raves I have enjoyed recently have been the ones at the King Street
Garage, Although the HardKiss brothers, Jeno and Garth have been playing there,
I think the real fun was of the small intimacy of the place and the way it is
run that make it the best (i.e. low cover charges, Ins/outs)

 Peace and Love

As to why raves can cost 10's of thousands of dollars...

1) The space:  unless you're really lucky or really illegal, most spaces that
can hold your average rave crowd will go for $1000-$2000.  The larger ones, up
to $15000 for the concourse. 

2)  The sound system.  I don't know HOW you got that kicking sound system for
$800, pete, but I'd like to know!  :)  Whenever I've heard figures for large
sound systems at raves, they've always been something like $1000-$1500... and
more I presume for some of the ULTRA-CLEAN systems like the one at Basics.

3)  The DJ's - Depends on who you get and how large you expect your event to
be (the DJ's will obviously ask more for playing the concourse than for playing
a back room somewhere) so for an average-sized event I would say $1500 for DJ's

4)  Security - if it's not included in #1, I'd say it usually goes for $500.

5)  Visuals - if you don't go for home-made and hire out some people, I'd say
it's easy to spend $1K-$2K....

6)  Promotion - this can cost several $K, depending on how nice you want it to
look and how many you want.

And all of this for the average 500-1500 person rave.  Now, I'm not saying there
aren't ways to defeat most of these costs, but just that I've seen all of them
mentioned before.  And this doesn't include insurance (if needed) or bribes to
law enforcement officials either.  =)

I am looking at DJing as any other Job and out here in the computer world
people get hired to do a job but before they are finished they might find a
better paying job.  They then tell their present employer that they are leaving
and sometimes that employer comes back with more incentives to stay. The latter
is considered very fair in the professional world.

But then again everything is considered fair in the profensional world
(including destroying the planet at an incredible rate, which we shall leave

There will be the second Deep Space Afterparty tonight in San Jose, well
to be exact, Santa Clara.  Last time Thomas played and the cover from what
I understand, was negligible.  What, a dollar? Something like that.  I have
no idea what to expect but if you're interested, from the Oasis at 200 First
st. get onto Santa Clara St. and chase it until it changes into the Alameda.
Follow this for a ways until you find yourself passing Santa Clara University.
Hang a left on Benton and then a subsequent right onto Lafayette St. (The 
North End of Bascom Ave.)  Travel just a bit (before the One Step turnoff) and
hang a right on Reed.  Grant (or it it Graham) comes up quick, and that's
the destination I've been given.  I'm not sure which wherehouse this would be
but hopefully, it will become apparant as people arrive.  Anyhow, for that's
worth,

> As to why raves can cost 10's of thousands of dollars...

I was just adding up Brian's numbers.

Total:      Low      High       Really High (concourse)
          -------  -------       --------
Cost        6K      8.5K         21.5K
(to the 	     
Promoter)

Not including, insurance, bribes, protection, etc.

The figure I'd heard, just hearsay, but supposedly from a
promoter,  is that a typical rave costs around $16K.

I think that would allow enough room to pay for the insurance, etc.

At $20 you only need 800 people to break even on a $16K rave.
It's not unusual to get thousands of people.

So what's going on?  There's a few possibilites:

(1) The bribery/protection racket is FAR worse than I've
ever imagined.

(2) There's a conspiracy among rave promoters to fix the prices high...
Possibly using the police to shut down the competition?

(3) The $20 ticket prices are a temporary thing, and are in
the process of falling to an equilibrium price of $10-15.
I think there's some sign this might be happening ($10 b4 11 deals).

and... this is my latest idea:

(4) Raves are a luxury market with an "upward sloping demand
curve".  Just like perfume, people assume that the more it
costs, the better it must be.  Part of what you're buying is
exclusiveness... you don't want just *anyone* to be able to
wear the same perfume that you do, and you don't want to run
into just anyone at a rave.  A high ticket price helps
screen out "undesireables".

No, these are two completely different things.  At a typical job in the
professional world, employment is terminated is by one party -- the employer
or employee -- giving the other party two weeks notice.  The exact details
are usually spelled out pretty clearly when you are hired.

A performer, on the other hand, agrees to perform at a specific time, for a
specific length of time, for a specific amount of money.  This is a commitment,
and not living up to it can be a breach of contract, unless the contract
explicitly describes how the contract can be broken.  (And a verbal agreement
is considered to be a contract.)

	Sorry about the delay, I spent the better part of this week moving
into a new apartment (outta the dorms for good!  hoo-ray)  Anyways, last
week's was fairly complete, so there wasn't much to add this week.  I would
probably recommend Channeling tomorrow night for you house music freaks and
"Razor" for those whose tastes are for hardcore techno;  on Saturday night 
I'm going to try and make the Global Rhythm Festival.  That sounds like a
lot of interesting people will be there... and Baby Ford played at my first
rave ever way back in 89, so I feel an obligation. :)  But competing against
it is Wicked, which almost always has a great vibe.  This is also Garth's
last performance until the Gathering, as he is going home to visit family
for the holidays...

	Anyways, enjoy yourselves!

Andrea is absolutely correct about Groove Kitchen on Sunday, but
omits one very important detail...

It's FREE!!!

Also, about Channeling on Friday -- the promoters want me to pass
the word along on the list that this is a joint production of:

	Come/Unity, Basics, Escape and Vortex

So if you like one or more of these events, you'll like this one
(it's way out in Concord somewhere).  Spun is also on the DJ list.

The after party for this is going to be a bit softer in volume than
usual, in order to foster actual person-to-person verbal communication
(hence, the name Channeling).

Subject: nocturnal woes

Went to the Nocturnal thing and it was going pretty good until
it got busted...lame..$7 downthetubes...

hmm....actually zak was going to post this, but I am really curious so
I will ask it in his spirit--

Has anyone noticed a different crowd when going to the Hardkiss-type parties
(actually, Hardkiss might be a bad example, but apt)..?

It seems to me that there are two rave (and why can't I spell that word out?
:) crowds--the family that goes to Basics and Destiny and such, and the 
ones that go to Fantasia and Hardkiss and stuff...I mean, I have hada  lot of fun
at the Deep Faith on thursdays, and I think Scott is just incredible, but 
tonight I noticed that there wasn't a lot of unity, that a lot of people
just go there to show up and look cool....I am not saying this is 
how Hardkiss parties are, but I seem to notice more of these types (bas
I mean, bad word, I'm sorry)at non basics type parties..

I  may be waaaaaay off.  It could be just the younger crowd or the skater
crowd..the real baggy crowd, but it does seem like there is a marked difference.

well, I muddled that one up pretty good...Has anyone noticed the different
sides of the rave crowds in SF?


(sorry zak, it's 3:30)

peace and love and I hope to see you all at Wicked.  Channeling soudns
really interesting...we talked to Martin tonight (NAME DROP ALERT) (but
we did! :)) and he was saying how they were going to have real ambient
music in the after party so poeple could like chill and talk and get to know
each other and stuff....sounds very very cool...so I am spreading the word
around...

I might be there, but the $$ situtation is getting very low with XMAS presents...

ANYWAY...I will see you all sometime this weekend...again, I will be the
skinny white guy with striped shirts and a blinking light with a horsey grin..

(there were a LOT of lights at basics... =)

Subject: Re:  nocturnal woes

I've been to the last two Hardkiss parties, and haven't noticed any lack of
interaction among the people attending.  In fact, I've noticed just the
opposite:  very friendly folks who seem to enjoy each other's company.  Lots
of smiles and hugs.  Maybe it's just the the King St. garage is freezing
cold this time of year, and hugs are the most efficient way of warming up
On another point, IMHO, you have a very nice smile that seems to be much
more human than equine.  OTOH, most members of the soon-to-disintegrate
House of Windsor appear to share more than just physical attributes with our
hooved friends.  I only hope that this invidious comparison hasn't insulted
Trigger et al.

Subject: Re:  nocturnal woes

Hey, our friend Mike!  Nice to see you last week at Basics!

I think there are more that just two circles within the house crowd.  I
think though that the Hardkisses have their own family, it's not like
Goontown.  We've been to lots of different parties [unlike some we don't
follow one promoter or one set of DJs everywhere and never go anywhere else]
and each party has it's own feel and ambience.  There are certainly regulars
of each, but I think a lot of the fun happens when the different groups mix.
 
Sure it's cosy to see the same people every time, hey don't get me wrong, I
love my friends, but frankly it'd all get old fast if we followed one crowd
exclusively.  I think too it is important to make new people feel welcome,
because it may be snug inside the circle but from outside it may look like
there's no way in.  I think the key to spreading good energy is to focus on
putting it out and on connecting with people [it's really exciting to learn
of the plans for Channeling's after party, Right on!] _and_ for the
promoters to be responsible in their choice of location and how they flyer.
Remember Geoffw's story of how the usually great vibe at Wicked was
threatened by some thugs?

A fun part for me of the Sharon/Hard Core party we went to in 1/2 moon bay
back in October was seeing different circles overlap, especially the skaters
[I think they're the usual Hard Core crowd] cuz I rarely see skaters at the
parties thrown by the UK contingent.  It's fun to hacve some cultural
exchange within our little subculture.

see you in the future...

ps- it's been CRAZY busy at work, we're setting up a MUSE for WELL users, so
I am WAY BEHIND in my mail.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, I am trying to get out

not particularly.  there definitely seem to be "rave promoter
groupies" though.  i can understand why.  if you're going to drop $20
on a night out you want to have a reasonable assurance of a good
return on your investment.  if you go to, say, basics and spend the
bucks and have a great time, you are going to be more likely to go to
another basics.

for me personally, the boredom factor plays an important role.  i go
out every weekend and for a long time it seemed like every single
weekend was a tony/josh/jeno/garth (in that order!) party.  it got
really old and now i'm actively seeking out different dj lineups.
fortunately, the hardkisses have been doing stellar service in that
regard, importing some of the hottest sounds to hit the bay area.  at
last week's birth/rebirth (aka scott hardkiss' birthday party), they
had mark farina from chicago and jon williams from LA - both djs were
phenomenal and quite different from the usual stuff we hear.

i have noticed since following the hardkiss guys around that the same
people do tend to go to their events but it's not any different from
what happens with other promoter groups.

so, as for whether or not basics is the only recurring event that
attracts "really cool" people, i can't say.  i always have a good time
at hardkiss parties.  maybe the basics crowd is more outgoing to
strangers.  maybe it's just that i already know everybody who goes to
hardkiss parties and i have a great time hanging with them.  i don't
notice the screaming bummer people.  if you're going to blame
anything, blame the location.  king st garage is quickly becoming one
of my least favorite spaces...

It's fuckin' Xcellent 'zine dude!

I picked mine up at The SJ-Oasis "deep space" last night (thu).

Happy chanukah. Torch up the 8-chambered chalice, maaan!

PS: Deep space was cool, but i liked the first one better -- first one
wasn't as crowded, more room to dance. What the fuck was Spun playing?

Just a quick FYI.  Spreading the vibe at a gay disco (such as Product, Gregg
Taylor's latest-hip-new-fresh-place-to-be-that-is-already-tired) is interpreted
as cruising.  Would've had no problem getting picked up if I hadn't come with a
date already!  Just thought you might want be interested.  ;-)

Share and Enjoy,

Tim

P.S.  If you're looking for something other than the mega-raves on New Year's
Eve, Gus is opening a new gay club called Cyclops.  It's going to be on
Saturday nights at the new Sound Factory after the new year.  But on the 31st,
he's having the opening night party.  Be there or B**2.

P.P.S.  I just had myself taken off the list for a week while I'm on vacation,
so I won't see any replies sent to sfraves, if you plan to honor my posting
with any such replies.  Ciao.

Thanks.  That was the short version, though.  There's a
longer double-sided version (that seems to be perpetually
"almost done") that I'm going to try passing around.  
I could post the ASCI version of it, but it's a bit long and
lots of people have seen it already in one form or another,
so just ask me if you want it mailed to you.  

I think I read about 3 or 4 megabytes of the archives to put
the thing together.  It was an especially strange experience
to check out the things in the "spirit" directory.  "Hm,
what's this thing called 'vision', that sounds good.  Oh, I
wrote it."

Section two: 

For you folks coming to the party on Saturday (at 122 Stillings, SF)
in preparation for a night of karmic debauchery or a good night sleep, my
home phone is 585-2787 in case you get lost on your way or
feel that need in the middle of the night and need to make that call.  ;-)
(Regarding the latter, you will get my "machine" which does boring 
phone.  ;-)

And since one of the sfravers coming asked if this pad of mine is accessible 
from public transport, the answer is yessirey.  I only know the BART bit.  You 
go to the Glen Park BART station.  It is at the corner of Bosworth and Diamond.
Go down Bosworth _away_ from the bridge and BART for a few blocks until
you hit Congo.  Turn left and hike up the hill (ok so it's not quite that
bad.)  Turn right on Stillings.  I'm three houses up on the right at 122.

"CHANGE", the mantra of President-elect Clinton, is revitalizing the 
field of psychedelic research.  The first flickerings of renewed 
research began a few years ago in Switzerland (seepage 21), in Russia 
(see page 24), and in the US.  These pioneering projects,approved after 
years of struggle with regulatory authorities, successfully demonstrated 
that scientific progress could be made without exacerbating drug abuse 
or catalyzing cultural turmoil.  To the contrary, intriguing hints were 
found suggesting that the appropriate use of psychedelics could help in 
the treatment of substance abuse and could heal some of the cultural 
wounds associated with the War on Drugs.  

In July, FDA's Drug Abuse Advisory Committee recommended the resumption 
of psychedelic research, subject to the condition that the standards of 
methodology and proof that the FDA uses to critique claims about other 
drugs must also be applied to psychedelics.  Over the summer, the 
Massachusetts Department of Corrections approved access to its files so 
that a follow-up study could be conducted to Dr.  Leary's 1962 inquiry 
into the use of psilocybin to reduce recidivism in prisoners (see page 
4).  In October, the FDA approved the first human study of MDMA (see 
page 2-3 and 36).  The FDA may soon approve marijuana research in the 
treatment of HIV-related wasting syndrome (see page6) and ibogaine to 
treat substance abuse.  Also, NIDA will probably fund DMT and psilocybin 
research (see page 8).  

Researchers in Switzerland are using PET scans to study ketamine and 
psilocybin (see page 18).  In Brazil, the religious use of the plant 
mixture, ayahuasca, has been accepted as legal (see page 29).  
Dennis McKenna's proposal for a biomedical investigation of ayahuasca, 
reported in the last MAPS newsletter, has been funded and will begin 
shortly.  In Russia,approval is likely for a study of MDMA's potential 
to treat alcoholics.  In Germany, psychiatrists will soon publish data 
about MDE research and may obtain approval to research MDMA.  

For MAPS, the renewal of psychedelic research carries its own imperative 
for change.  Facilitating communication between researchers and 
regulators is more essential, delicate, time-consuming, and expensive 
than ever before.  This newsletter is our lengthiest ever printed and is 
being sent to a record 375 MAPS members and 300 interested others.  MAPS 
has demonstrated success by gaining approval for MDMA research after a 
seven-year struggle.  Though I continue to donate my time, responding to 
the challenge of MAPS' new opportunities requires my full time attention 
and has encouraged me to take a leave of absence from a Ph.D.  program 
in Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.  To be viable 
in the long run, MAPS needs additional funds both to pay for research 
and to support a full-time president.  Future progress depends upon the 
extent to which we conduct scientifically proficient and culturally 
sensitive research, and upon your generosity in donating funds to 
support MAPS' work.

-------------------  Proposed Upcoming MAP Events  --------------------

TO:     MAPS Members and Interested Parties
FROM:   Rick Doblin, MAPS President
DATE:   December 7, 1992
RE:     Upcoming Events

There are several possible events in the early stages of planning that 
I'd like to mention briefly to you.  These events may commemorate the 
50th anniversary of Albert Hofmann's discovery of LSD and proceeds would 
go partly to benefit MAPS and psychedelic and medical marijuana research.  

While the details will follow in the next newsletter, we are thinking to 
hold the first event in Santa Cruz or the San Francisco Bay area on 
Friday night, April 16th, 1993.  This date marks 50 years to the day 
that Dr.  Albert Hofmann accidentally ingested a small amount of LSD and 
discovered that it had unusual psychoactive effects.  MAPS, the Island 
Foundation, perhaps the Albert Hofmann Foundation and other groups will 
co-sponsor a celebration and tribute to LSD.  The concept is to create a 
cultural/artistic event that would feature musicians, painters, authors 
and poets expressing through their work what LSD has meant to them.  In 
addition, we hope to have some people not normally associated with the 
psychedelic movement as well as psychedelic pioneers speaking about the 
role LSD has played in their lives.  

The following day, Saturday, April 17, we (in this case MAPS and the 
Cannabis Action Network and their campus-based activists) are thinking 
of organizing a national celebration of Bicycle Day, commemorating the 
bicycle ride that Albert Hofmann took home from the laboratory on April 
19 after intentionally ingesting 250 micrograms of LSD.  Originated and 
trademarked by Dr.  Tom Roberts, one of the founders of the International 
Transpersonal Association, Bicycle Day has been celebrated for about 
four years by an increasing number of people on the nearest Saturday to 
April 19.  We are considering asking people to sponsor volunteers
(mostly college students) to ride their bikes for a certain number of 
miles, donating a certain amount per mile to support research into 
psychedelics and the medical use of marijuana.  

I am also exploring the possibility of asking rave organizers around the 
US and in other countries to arrange simultaneous "Raves for Research" 
on the night of April 17 to raise funds for MAPS for research into LSD, 
MDMA, and marijuana.  Rave organizers have already raised funds for 
Greenpeace, Amnesty International, various Rainforest groups, AIDS 
research, pro-choice groups, as well as other causes.  

In addition, the Albert Hofmann Foundation is in the early planning 
stages of a large scientific conference on LSD to be held in May in Los 
Angeles, which Dr.  Albert Hofmann himself may attend.  

If you would like to help with any of the potential MAPS events, if you 
have any suggestions about possible speakers at the April 16th event, or 
if you have any thoughts about how best to raise funds for psychedelic 
research and the work of MAPS, please get in touch by writing to Rick 
Doblin, MAPS, 1801 Tippah Avenue, Charlotte, NC 28205, or calling at

MAPS is a membership-based organization working to assist psychedelic 
researchers around the world design, obtain governmental approval, fund, 
conduct and report on psychedelic research in humans.  Founded in 1986, 
MAPS is an IRS approved 501 (c)(3) non-profit corporation funded by tax 
deductible donations from about two hundred members.  MAPS' founder and 
current president, Rick Doblin, is on leave of absence from the PhD.  
program in Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and 
has previously graduated from Stan and Christina Grof's Holotropic 
Breathwork 3 year training program.  
                                                                                     
MAPS has previously funded basic scientific research in both humans and 
animals into the safety of MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Ecstasy) 
and has opened a Drug Master File for MDMA at the U.S.  Food and Drug 
Administration.  MAPS is now focused primarily on assisting scientists 
to conduct human studies to generate essential information about the 
risks and psychotherapeutic benefits of MDMA and other psychedelics, 
with the goal of eventually gaining governmental approval for their 
medical uses.  
                                                                                     
Albert Einstein wrote that "Imagination is more important than 
knowledge."  If you can even faintly imagine a cultural re-integration 
of the use of psychedelics and the states of mind they engender, please 
consider joining MAPS in supporting the expansion of scientific 
knowledge in this area.  Progress is possible with the support of 
individuals who care enough to take individual and collective action.  
In addition to supporting research, your contributions will return to 
you the following benefits:  
                                                                                     
The MAPS Newsletter Each quarterly newsletter will report on MAPS 
research in progress.  In addition to reporting on our own studies, the 
newsletter will focus on psychedelic research both in the US and abroad

"The real difficulty, the difficulty that has baffled the sages of all 
times, is rather this:  how can we make our teaching so potent in the 
emotional life of man, that its influence should withstand the pressure 
of the elemental psychic forces in the individual?"  Albert Einstein

Subject: Musical background

Hi everyone!
I'm interested in hearing from everyone about their background, as far
as music goes.  I'm talking about listening, not performing etc.

I got interested in this during discussions with several people about
how they came into liking 'rave' music (sorry... I know it's a lame term
but the people I've talked to have had tastes ranging from Brian Eno
to Messiah... and all considered it 'rave' music) and the diversity of
people's musical tastes really surprised me.

What I'd like is if you would send me mail answering the following
questions.  I'll sumarize the responses, if anyone wants me to.
Not being a wimp, my answers are bracketed after the questions.

Q1:  What is the style of music you listen to most?

[[right now, tribal/'epic' techno]]

Q2:  1 Year ago, what style of music did you listen to most?

[[industrial dance]]

Q3:  Where did you first hear 'rave' music?

[[at a friend's apt]]

Q4: Who is your favorite group today?

[[Skinny Puppy]]

Q5: Who was your favorite group 1 yr. ago?

[[Skinny Puppy]]

Q6: Musically, what do you like least about 'rave' music?

[[boring formula house music]]


Thanks, and happy holidays.

Subject: Re:  Musical background

(btw, unlike most surveys, I think it would be appropriate to post it to the
whole list, as long as you put a little thought into your posts...)

>Q1:  What is the style of music you listen to most?

One third tribal/trancey/dub house (like most of the rave music played here)
One third ambient (The Aphex Twin full-length CD is incredible!!)
And one third alternative "slime 105" music (I just bought the new Inspiral
  Carpets CD and love it to death)

>Q2:  1 Year ago, what style of music did you listen to most?

Harder edged techno (Yes, even LA Style hee hee) and more mainstream 
   alternative (REM, etc.)

>Q3:  Where did you first hear 'rave' music?

1988... KROQ late at night, Swedish Egil had 2 hours of acid-house on Sunday
nights... it was _incredible_.  My first rave as fall 1989, and I had never
heard so much new,  wonderfully mindbending music.

>Q4: Who is your favorite group today?

Oh man, hard to answer!  Hmm..  I know Mike hates them but I still really like
808 State, but it fluctuates between them and Aphex Twin and everything...
And of course, the Orb comes in when nothing else is there.  

>Q5: Who was your favorite group 1 yr. ago?

The Shamen - the original version of En-Tact was marvelous. Though it's hard to
remember for me, since I go through so many "favorite groups" so quickly.  I
think I also really like Fatima Mansions at this point.

>Q6: Musically, what do you like least about 'rave' music?

Lyrics.  Rarely do the work for me.  If they're short and simple and generic
I like it, but if they go on they lose me... and when there are lots of lyrics
the music tends to be boring, which is really what I'm after anyways.....

Oh, and one more thing... the whole impermanence of it all.  Only a few groups
actually have lasting power - most music is outdated in a matter of weeks. 
Really makes it hard to try and acquire on vinyl or CD the music that's 
defining my experience.

Subject: Another Friday Washout

I dunno, Fridays are not my night.  Couldn't get through on the 800
number for Razor, but it's fair to say that M Normal warned me about
that happening sometimes.  Channeling was somewhere way out in Concord.
Sin moved to upstairs I-Beam and was supposedly only admitting until
2 am.  I was slightly tempted because I've never heard Jan Cooley,
but it seemed less than promising overall.

So I took off from 9th St around 1 am to track down Happy Happy Joi Joi,
in the warehouse district off the Army exit from 101.  Got there 
(215 Napoleon) just in time to find the crowd milling around outside
and a few cops trying to move everyone out.  Back to 177 Townsend,
where I hung outside for a while but didn't much like the vibe,
Some people were heading over to the Trocadero, but when I got there
that scene seemed pretty dull as well.

I wasn't the only one.  All of a sudden about 15 cars materialized
down the block from the Troc', in the First Interstate parking lot.
Someone with a massive car audio system was blasting WILD-107
intermittently for a while.  About 30 or 40 people gathered around
and kinda jumped up and down a short while.  Then they sang
Happy Birthday for someone.  I drifted back to Townsend and decided
to split for good.  The short-lived First InterRave scene was the
closest to real fun tonight.

Tomorrow we gonna get SERIOUS!, however.  Us out-of-towners have
to take what we can get, and I've never seen Jeno and Garth, so it
looks like a Wicked time for me . . .

--Actually, some people who are accessible to us feel MDMA was made illegal
as a result of Rick Doblin in the first place.  (pretty wild accusation
though).

-------------------  Proposed Upcoming MAP Events  --------------------
>There are several possible events in the early stages of planning that 
I'd like to mention briefly to you.  These events may commemorate the 
50th anniversary of Albert Hofmann's discovery of LSD and proceeds would 
go partly to benefit MAPS and psychedelic and medical marijuana research.  

>While the details will follow in the next newsletter, we are thinking to 
hold the first event in Santa Cruz or the San Francisco Bay area on 
Friday night, April 16th, 1993.  This date marks 50 years to the day 
that Dr.  Albert Hofmann accidentally ingested a small amount of LSD and 
discovered that it had unusual psychoactive effects.  MAPS, the Island 
Foundation, perhaps the Albert Hofmann Foundation and other groups will 
co-sponsor a celebration and tribute to LSD.  The concept is to create a 
cultural/artistic event that would feature musicians, painters, authors 
and poets expressing through their work what LSD has meant to them.  In 
addition, we hope to have some people not normally associated with the 
psychedelic movement as well as psychedelic pioneers speaking about the 
role LSD has played in their lives.  

--This whole scenario was framed at an Island Group meeting for an Island
Group event and a proposal was sent to Rick Doblin inviting him and his group
to participate by Bruce Eisner.  This newsletter insert is Rick's response.

>The following day, Saturday, April 17, we (in this case MAPS and the 
Cannabis Action Network and their campus-based activists) are thinking 
of organizing a national celebration of Bicycle Day, commemorating the 
bicycle ride that Albert Hofmann took home from the laboratory on April 
19 after intentionally ingesting 250 micrograms of LSD.  Originated and 
trademarked by Dr.  Tom Roberts, one of the founders of the International 
Transpersonal Association, Bicycle Day ........

Jackson then Tom Roberts can trademark Bicycle Day.  Can't wait to get my

Subject: [howard@netcom.com: Musical background]

Well here goes...

Q1:  What is the style of music you listen to most?

I listen to alot of different stuff: tribal/ ambient/ epic
techno, older style industrial (dance) techno and modern psychedelia
(Bevis Frond, Inspiral Carpets, etc.)

Q2:  1 Year ago, what style of music did you listen to most?

The same as above...

Q3:  Where did you first hear 'rave' music?

I really can't put my finger on it as I have always been into any
type of "computer" music. I've listened to some of my older (mid 80's)
music and some of it sounds suspiciously similar to "rave" music. I
probably heard it on late night/ early morning radio (college) as I
used to put in alot of all nighters at work.

Q4: Who is your favorite group today?

I don't have a favorite, rather many favorites Including: Front Line
Assembly and all spin-offs (Delerium, Noise Unit, Intermix), Front 242,
chris and cosey, Trance 2 Dance, Orb, Orbital, Psychic TV, Coil....

Q5: Who was your favorite group 1 yr. ago?

Front 242, Front Line Assembly (and spin-offs), Love and Rockets

Q6: Musically, what do you like least about 'rave' music?

Really repitiious, uninspired formula music, be it techno, house 
or whatever

Subject: Raves = Censorship?

at the radio station i work at we are trying to come up with a program 
about censorship,. or "Family Values"
orsomethign  alog that line

and i was thinking at a club about what i could cover that
is censored by society or the govt or whatver
and it hits me...
the whole underground culture is being censored
distorted amnd perveted by the media
and i think that it would be a really bizarre but
applicable idea..

sooo....
my project now is to find some people who would agree with me on this
who are heavily involved and maybe some people who would disagree
and what not from around the country or the world actually would be 
nice and then the show would be a bunch of interviews
with promoters, ravers, dj's, police, whoever
and whether they think that the ideology of the 
underground scene is being cenosred by society
or just the media or whatever
and the idea is real strong in my head, but its not coming out right
now, but i think the jist is there

so.....
feel free to send me and input you would have on this subject
and also if possible names of people who promote
spin, sell drugs i dont care, who might have somehting
interesting to say about the subject

thanks
happy christmas hannukah new years 
and remember cutting off the top of a tree is much
nicer than cutting the whole tree down

Subject: Waxing & Waning


It's 7:30 and I'm still moving in that zone where you come home and you've
been zooming around for uncounted hours and you're feeling great,
energized, ready for some *serious* sleep!  I was one of the oldest
people at Turtle Wax tonight (Turtle Whacks?!) and it didn't bother
me too much because it seems clear I was Born to Rave.

Ahem.

Well, it all started with a tactical slip.  I mean, I wasn't really
being consistent with my own logic.  I happened to be at Ameba 'round
6 pm and they said the Global event would be at Caesar's, with room
for maybe 1,000. *That* meant likely overflow to everywhere else,
except there wasn't very much 'everywhere else' apparent tonight.
And I was planning to go to Wicked.

The next logical step, the one I didn't take, was concluding that the
crowd at King St. would be exceptionally large as a result, and it
would be prudent to arrive early.  But no, I figured it would be
better to arrive a little later when things settled down.

Wrong.

Arrived at 2 am and about 150 people are milling around outside.
Nobody is going in.  Considering the size of the crowd inside and
the likely turnover, it figured to be a long wait.

Instead I hiked over to Turtle Wax (?!) at 540 4th (Trocadero).
The price was higher - $20 (with $5 off for a donation towards a
Christmas food and clothing drive).  And I hadn't liked the look
of the place when checking it out Friday.  But seeing as there
wasn't much of a choice, I took the plunge.  Turned out my tactical
mistake produced a rather fine result.

Turtle Wax.  The one Vit B disdained in the weekly guide for the
slogan on its flyer: 'Come out of your shell 'cuz we're fuckin'
shit up.'  OK, so it might lay a (turtle) egg.

Turns out it's a pretty nice space, old wooden floor underneath,
good acoustics, not perfect but LOUD sound with massive subwoofers.
Fine, pretty much continuous lasers.  Not too crowded, and the
attitude of the door and inside crew seemed pretty cool.  The early
crowd wasn't into it as much, but I was having a pretty good time.
There were some very fine moments, but the crowd energy seemed down, not
as much dancing as I'd expected.

Around 4 I headed back over to King St.  Outside, a much smaller crowd,
maybe 50, and nobody going in.  The proceedings inside seemed fine enough,
while I was there they played the old Washington, DC go-go-
classic "Good to Go."  As some may know, go-go is black DC's
equivalent of a rave, except they have all-night live shows.
Trouble Funk, Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, E.U., many
others -- a sound developing pretty directly from early Kool and
the Gang and like that.

But I digress.

Hiked back to Turtle Town.  Things are picking up.  A new DJ is
on spinning an incredible variety of things, lots of old soul standards,
some North African sounding things, lots of whoknowswhut.
He even played the entire 'Mi God Mi King' by Papa
Levi that I have on an old compilation dub album -- the fastest
ragga rap I've ever heard to begin with -- at about 50% faster
speed.  Heard that start and I couldn't help cracking up!
On & on & on -- well over an hour set, best I've heard so far.

The dancing spread out and the proportion of dancers increased.
Still not the *friendliest* event I've been to, but pretty decent.
Sort of a makeshift chillout space in the upstairs balcony.
Somebody has written in the corner of a window between the upstairs
bar and the floor, "please remove this glass!"

I'm in a roomful of people I don't know, they're mostly younger
than me.  Doesn't seem to matter.  Those who are dancing keep it
going for long stretches.  I'm in for about 20 minutes at a time
with a few off.  That great space where it's just you and the music
and whatever your body happens to be doing at the time is right
. . . *there*.  Aha!  See, it all worked out.  The weirder the
mixing gets, the more the crowd seems to like it.  Me too.

It's probably not much different for anyone else.  The reason to
do all this, go through all this trouble to deal with unreliable
organizational scenes and mediocre DJs and sound systems and
overpriced venues . . . it's simple.  When it works, it's fun and
it feels total maxout great!

So who knows, I may be back at New Year's for the Gathering and
finally see Jeno and Garth and Spun and Josh and Markie-Mark
after all!

by the way, I noticed as I was leaving the illfated entrance to
Wicked that the stoplight at 2nd and King has three lights, two
of them lit.  The one on top is a flashing red circle, and the
one in the middle is a solid red X.    Hmmm.

Subject: Weekend Update


Thursday night - decided on a whim to drive down to San Jose to check out
Deep Space.  It was only after driving down and meeting up with Geoff that
I realized that the flyer (and my own calendar - duh!) said it was 21+.  Oh
well, I thought, if I didn't make it in there would be the afterparty.  I
decided to try anyways, and either the club really is 18+ or the door man 
was cool, coz I got in no problem.  

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Nice layout, nice clean sound system,
plenty of lights and projections, and a decent, if chilly, ambient lounge.
The club attitude San Jose is notorious for was present somewhat but greatly
subdued.  Spun and Garth played decent sets (Spun's playing more hip/hop and
funk, instead of the "tweak" music he used to do mostly which I love).  The
lights came on at two to an open house and the promoters announced the 
afterparty location.  Well worth $5.


Saturday night - Global Rhythm Festival.  Better than expected and exactly
what I hoped.  The music (for the most part) was killer, and the crowd was
much better than I was afraid it was going to be.  They had a real game of
round-robin going with the Dj's, who each only had 45 minutes to an hour to
play.  First up when I got there was DJ Lime from SL2 who played some 
blisteringly fast breakbeat; while I usually dog on breakbeat it was 
interesting to hear it for variety's sake.  About half of what he played was
really excellent and the other half awful.  He played a lot of stuff from
XL Records (his label) plus a lot of his own remixes... 

Next up was Eon, who (along with Baby Ford) was supposed to play live but the
promoters _lost_ their equipment (according to Baby Ford himself - he said they
were "terribly unorganized") so instead the two of them DJ'd for about 45 
minutes each.  Eon played some hardcore trance, which again was interesting to 
hear simply for variety's sake.  Baby Ford came on and played a lot of melodic
acid house, (which I absolutely go crazy for) finishing it off with a yellow
slab of clear vinyl with a big happy face on the label (gee, Bryan, I wonder
which album THAT could be).  Oh, and he played the Legendary Fingers speech
over one great acid song, and it worked REALLY well.

Next up was Doc Martin.  He proceeded to play perhaps the best single DJ set
I have heard in months.  His combination of funky guitars and melodies with
techno drums and synths was just incredible - and his mixing was smooth, very
smooth.  About halfway through his set, a guy walked up to the table and 
motioned to Doc.  He was holding a trumpet with a microphone in front of it.
This was Blow - he proceeded to play trumpet melodies on top of Doc's music,
and it sounded WONDERFUL.  I've never seen such synergy between a DJ and a
live musician.  Blow must have had a remote mic, because he walked throughout
the audience tooting his horn, and after each time he played he was 
congradulated and hugged by the dancers, who cheered him on.  Also during
Doc's set, during a particularly beat-heavy sing, someone placed their 
almost-empty plastic cup of ice water on the bass bins in front of the DJ
table.  The cup began to dance!  The vibrations were just heavy enough to
counter the weight of the cup, whose ballast kept it upright.  Insane.

After Blow was done "Evil" Eddie Richards came on and played more hardcore,
which seemed out of place since Doc had finished with some pretty housy
stuff andthe hardcore "Evil" was playing got boring pretty quickly, so I
decided to leave (this was about 4am).  I really was considering staying
to hear Scott Hardkiss and DJ Dag, but sitting through an hour of more 
hardcore didn't sound appealing to me.  

I came mainly for the music; I figured I'd be hanging around the DJ table 
most of if not the entire night.  I figured all the cool people were going
to Wicked... =)  The crowd actually was better than I expected - the vibe and
attitude was fun, alcohol was being served at the bar but I didn't see any
on the dance floor, and the naked-chest-guys were at a minimum. The lighting
wasn't overpowering but after the laser got set up it was decent, as was the
chill space.  There were LOTS of vendors there too, which meant lower prices
(two necklaces for $5 woo hoo!) and plenty of food.  The Latin Palace staff
tried selling fried food, which I thought was an odd thing to sell at a rave
(so must have everyone else - I didn't see anyone buying any).

It was a nice change of pace from the "Garth-Jeno axis".  Well worth it.
How was Wicked?

Wow another person with the same view as me.  This is one of my biggest Rave
pet peaves.  The guys that go to Raves and take their shirt off and just stand
around looking machoo hoping some cute girl (or guy) will notice them and talk
to them.  I can understand having your shirt off becasue you are overheating
from dancing though.  

I didnt do anything this weekend but was coming home from Marin this morning so
I stopped by DNA and it was hopping.  I saw Lee and Gunther there and a few
other friends.  They had a cool little laser show going, which by the way does
anyone know who I can contact to get literature on buying laser equipment, and
how much promoters pay to have lasers at there raves?

That's if my memory serves me correctly.
While I'm not sure about Doc Marten, the thing playing at the End Up
should turn out to be a regular thing, with people coming after a
certain hour (9 or so) paying and before that not.

Also, Nikki Rivera at The Stud ($3) (9th & Harrison),
and some free rave thing at 1015 Folsom.

I suppose the usual stuff at The Sanctuary (out near the Army St area),
but who knows.  I'm not keeping up with the underground stuff that much
(the dealers who pay me to chouffer them around have been bugging me
a lot recently and I need a break.)

I'm going to try to be at the End Up earlier, and then go to 1015
Folsom later on.

I kind of had the impression you don't exactly go to sleep on the stuff....

They really will write anything though, so it's not worth bothering about.

Here's a couple ID requests to the experts out there.  These come
from the Garth "Skin Up" tape.

1) The song following FSoL's "Stolen Documents".  It's a manic, jazzy piano
number with a galloping bass and drum line.  The break is hip-hoppy
with a sample of the whistle from Big Daddy Kane's "Raw".

2) A deep house song with the repeated male vocal sample "I was always
built for house" or something similar.

3) A funky tribalish song with a repeated sample saying "Zulu, so funky",
though I'm probbably wrong here too.

	This could happen, in other words some asshole could give a woman
	asprin and procede to rape her.  I guess it is implied that the
	XTC in some way made her "want it" or at least made it hard for her
	to resist.  I think XTC can make you more open and if you are the type
	of person who is spending as much time as you can at a party getting
	fucked up to a state of unconsciousness, then this could happen, but
	alcohol and barbituates are far cheaper if you are a jerk who
	would do something like that.  Beware, the implication is that
	XTC makes people want to fuck who would not want to when they are
	straight, this is nonsense, XTC will make you more open and outgoing
	and friendly,  It might be a little harder to get up an aggressive
	steam of adrenelin when some asshole gets in your face but that is the
	fault of the asshole.  Maybe they need to run an article on how
	alcohol-induced men drugged and raped 6 women.  Having visited
	Norway an other scandinavian countries several times, it seems that
	if there is any sort of drug problem, it is with alcohol
	(don't get me wrong, I'm not down on the stuff or people who drink
	it, but if we are going to write sensational stories that lay blame,
	let's lay it in the right place.)

	Most people that I associate with at raves here are trying to
	"wake up" not "go under".

actually being nekkid on sfraves is kinda pointless

(well i must admit i post a lot while not wearing clothes
or at least used to before winter, but havign a terminal
next to my bed might have something to do with that)

over last summer i got quite used to taking off my shirt
while just dancing and hanging out in the park 
cuz it was hot and i love the sun and all
but i think it feels a lot more natural to be that way
than to have clothing on

(ive always felt this, but used to be too self-conscious
to actually do anything about...
the next chapter in the way house music has changed my life)

but when i went back to school i still felt that the most
natural/comfortable way to be was shirtless
but for some reason i felt real conspicuous being that way

i also noticed people staring at one woman was a little
more into lack of clothing than they were
which i thought was kinda lame, cuz she wasnt doing it
to show off, actually she was just on some drugs and 
didnt really notice/care

Subject: Channeling

Well, I went to channelling Friday night and had a great time. It was indeed
up Concord way (note for the San Jose ravers, Concord is actually closer than
San Francisco).

It reminded me alot of a Basics rave (not surprising since Martin had a hand
in it). The big fluorescent banners were up and there was the standard 4 
speaker stacks in the 4 corners of the room setup. The visuals were minimal
(the banners, a bunch of fluorescent lights and 4 strobes).

The crowd was young, friendly and very small (well under 100 at the rave's 
peak, and about 20 at the very end). Many people just walked up to me and
introduced themselves throughout the night.

Unfortunately, the party never really reached critical mass. It sort of 
petered out around 5:30 and the promoters shut it down. Probably the result
of under-promotion, the location and the fact that there were 4 other raves
going on. I never heard anything about the ambient chillout afterparty that
was supposed to happen, which was a bummer. I was really primed to go and
chill, especially with that crowd.

First of all, for those of you I didn't see at 1015 Folsom last night,
have a kickin' solstice!!

I thought the Groove Kitchen free X-mas party went off in a big way.
The crowd was a bit more diverse than usual, as there was a hairdresser's
party (!) earlier that overlapped, but the energy was high and festive.
It would have been a great party even for $10.  As a friend pointed out, it's
rare that there is a bad event in that space.  One thing I didn't like
about the remodelling there is that the DJ's are now glassed off from the
dance floor.  I wonder if Come/Unity will be able to work around that and
put the DJ's in the middle of the floor, where they belong!

And now for this week's late addition to the calendar:  Credo will be
at the ol' Trocadero (520 4th St.) on Wednesday night with Spun, Jon
Williams, Capt. Bastard from SpaceTime, and special guest.  This to
celebrate the New Moon (oh boy, only ten more shopping days 'til the
next FMR...)

It may be a little late, but I am feeling talkative,
and a tad bit irky, so I will talk about the events
that attended this weekend..

First off, went to Wicked with high hopes for a good
friendly time, and saw the hopes dashed...
I heard bad things about the space, but I had to see for
myself...I hate that place.  Too small, too light, and
too many people drinking beer...
Garth was spinning when I came in, which was surprising,
and kinda lame...I like him and Jeno more in the wee morning
hours, when I can fully enjoy the music. 
It was really loud there, and I tried to a little bit of 
"Bass Surfing" as Mark from Ameba says, which was fun,
until the place got so crowded it was hard to move anywhere.
The chill areas up top are cool, but I don't really like separate
floors.  I like chilling on the sides, so I can get up and dance,
or when I dance I can talk easily to the chillers...get it?
I was disappointed with the "vibe"...felt like a weekly
alternative club scene...the cops came by (because of the
crowd?) and the music turned waaay down, and it got kinda
sketchy...we were BUMMED by then, and we just got kinda 
fed up with the whole deal and split...Jeno was playing some 
housier stuff, which was okay, but he didn't seem really as
smooth as usual....it was great to see Paul and friends (sorry
I didn't see you before I left!) and some others from the
Basics scene, but I bailed...maybe I was just feeling grumpy
cuz it was my last $13 to my name and it went down the 
tubes...
urgh urgh urgh

Sunday night was really fun, though, as the free Grooove kitchen.
good to see Taxi and Mykl there, that was cool.  I don't like
the DJ aquarium either.   Spun wasn't playing as much mind-fuck
tunes as much as I like, but it was okay, well worth the $1 coat
check fee!  
I have no idea if I am going out any more this week, but I will
be at the Gathering. If I don't log on again, please have a safe
and merry holiday week (youknowwhatImean!)..

much peace and love,
mike

Have to agree with our friend Michael on this one.  Although I have had some
good times at the King St. space, I grow incredibly weary of it.  The music
began ok for me, but went really downhill after the speaker problem - care
for some ear-splitting feedback, scarecrow?  Course, by that time I was lost
in the ozone and not yet ready to attempt driving.  So I went upstairs to
chill for a bit and talk and make new friends.  Ended up driving my friend
Neil and his girlfriend Irene over to Berkeley - he had lost his keys - and
then back across the bridge to the End Up.  Interestingly enuf, the End Up
DJ was playing far more techno than I had heard there in a long time.  Nice
place to chill for a while.  Then off to church where Jamie and I helped out
in a choir rendition of a chorus from Handel's Messiah.  And no, the words
did not include:  Did I dream you dreamed about me :-).  After a short
rehearsal for Christmas eve, Rob and I went off to a brunch with some of the
City's "A-gays" (I'll explain if you want).  Much posturing by a member of
the SF Board of Supervisors; complaints about a month-long trip to Thailand
and India, with a return stopover in Paris (I should be so fortunate), so we
quickly left.  A brief nap while watching episodes from The Civil War, then
on to another Christmas party.  Great food, wonderful local wines,
interesting conversation.  Batteries on serious low, so no attempt to get to
Groove Kitchen.  Great to see you Mike and Taxi.

Gonna lay low this weekend, and save my energy for New Year's partying.
Hope everyone has a great solstice, holiday, or whatever.  Later, dudes and
dudettes.
Pizza luv,

If you can't find it, you can go to the Tiger Shop at your local

Subject: CNN rave report

I just saw CNN's report on raves.  They interviewed some LA promoters and
dj's (Doc Martin).  Here's what CNN basically said about raves:
1) it could be the next woodstock
2) it's going mainstream
3) it's the next big music craze .......for awhile.

It looks like they're right.  I'm seeing alot of rave clothes being sold
at the malls and most sports highlights on TV, uses techno in the
background. (BTW, Are there any ravers out there that watches sports?) 

Oh,ooh, got to go back to work.  

have a Merry EKSMAS - see I didn't use "X" mas. ;)

i donUt think clothes vs. body is a distinction. i like seeing
people at raves work out a style that might invlove their
involvements with fabric or flesh or both. people use a variety of
props to create their aura/ their eclat/ their tude, gestalt,
etc...]
i think at this stage in the historical game, even your body is a
prop, and displaying it is on par with posing in clothes. different
tropes, for different folks so to speak.
besides, even at raves, i doubt weUve evolved to a point where
gender could be writtend out of the equation in terms of who feels
comfortable, and who might not, or might be made to feel
uncomfortable by people reading shirtlessness in terms of a
stereotype and not just shirtlessness. and i think there are
negative guy and woman sterotypes at risk.

Subject: Clothes and nudity



As a form of individualistic artistic expression, I find bare
bodies to be relatively boring unless accentuated by tatoos, 
piercings, scars/mutilations, prostetheses or other artificial
enhancements.  And while it is true that body builders sculpt 
their muscle structure as a form of art, such expressions are still 
rather limited to the limits imposed by basic human biology.
Clothing and ornaments by their very nature enable us to express
ideas and feelings that transcend our animal selves even when only
simple colors and textures are used, let alone interesting patterns
and symbols.  When I rave, among other things, I like sensory
stimulation.  When I see a shirtless guy at a rave, I see, at
best, mammal-who-may-be-hot-or-is-just-proud-to-be-a-mammal.  I
find this form of expression stiflingly uncreative.

while i agree that the bare human body is a lot more boring
that nice pretty rave clothes
but i rarely wear those
and clothes are too burdensome or whatver 
for me... i feel a lot freer running around with minimal clothes
on, just feeling everything
i always dance barefoot unless some bitchy cocktail waitress
tells me i have to wear shoes

but i will say that trying to look cool in clothes is a lot easier
than trying to make your naked body look more appealing
i think i just stopped caring..

i love the outfits that people wear though, and being superficial
i judge people by what they wear,
assuming that someone willing to wear a little more outlandish costume
is more likely to be a cool person than the person whos outfit
is the same as that of the model in the guess advert
(which would probably make them look very nice...but i dont care about
looks in that way)

i dont want everyone running around naked, not everyone wants to 
and it would stifle creativity

i dont have creativity in clothing, or at least i dont try to
so being naked's a lot better

it's a slow week what with everybody taking off for the holidays and

taken from the liner notes of the underground resistance "resistance
for change" CD... all grammar errors preserved.

RIOT

Underground Resistance is a label for a movement.  A movement that
wants change by Sonic Revolution.  We urge you to join the Resistance
and help us to combat the mediocre audio and visual programming that
is being fed to the inhabitants of earth, this programming is
stagnating the minds of the people: building a wall between races and
preventing world peace.  It is this wall we are going to smash.  By
using the untapped energy potential of sound we are going to destroy
this wall much the same as certain frequencies shatter glass.  Techno
is a music based in experimentation: it is sacred to no one race; it
has no definitive sound.  It is music for the future of the Human
Race.  Without this music there will be no peace, no love, no vision.
By simply communicating through sound, Techno has brought people of
all different nationalities together under one roof to enjoy
themselves.  Isn't it obvious that music and dance are the keys to the
universe?  So called primitive animals and tribal humans have known
this for thousands of years!  We urge all brothers and sisters of the
underground to create and transmit their tones and frequencies no
matter how so called primitive their equipment may be.  Transmit these
tones and wreck havok on the programmers!  Long live the
Underground...

The other day I was paging thru the sunday comikle/eXaminer and noted a
clothing ad for "junior misses" sporting the latest fashion -- baggy
ravejeans and striped shirts. Basically Ravewear that Missy and Buffy can
wear to school! Hoo boy!

I guess that's why I never bought any ravewear and just wear the clothes I
wear to work/play at raves (of course, I do tend to wear pretty obnoxious
clothes to work, but they're not rave clothes!). You see, eventually I
figured ravewear would become trendy, and I'd feel like yet another
dick-head manipulated by the media/corporate-amerikkka into yet another
stupid money-wasting trend. I find it irksome that there are these
middle-aged-white-males running things from the highrise glass towers of
babylon and deciding scientifically how to manipulate our minds and
separate ourselves from our cash.

Oh, and I thought I'd mention a little story that happened to my Bro-in-law
in New Yawk City. He had bought a pair of those bright orange "cross colors
hip-hop nation" pants (because he likes bright obnoxious clashing
colors)... and he was wearing them like normal pants, you know, proper
length, not pulled down way low so yer butt-crack shows, not rolled up or
bunched and ruffled-up accordion-stylee near the feet. You know, the way
pants are SUPPOSED to be worn. The way your momma wanted you to wear pants.

I would have typed this in sooner but since the typesetting was done on a

This is not so much about what raves are or aren't, than 
about what they MIGHT be.

So don't bother looking here for a rehash of the obvious: that raves 
are the latest thing in underground dance parties/about having 
fun/feeling good/Peace/Energy/Unity ... all of which IS true, 
needless to say, but there remains so much more to be said, so much 
more to BE!

CUT through the clouds of trendism and commercialization that 
attach themselves to any major new mutation in culture. What wants 
to be invoked (what I want to invoke--what I hope YOU want to 
invoke) is that imaginal, incandescent core out of which all the 
smoke & noise is generated; what a rave truly can be, for some 
people in some situations--what it could BECOME; and then, peeling 
away at the sides, ... falling off one by one, duller, flatter, greyer ... 
and ever so much more TAME ... all those would-be and almost-raves, 
unavoidable byproducts of anything too real.

An old Sufi saying has it that: "where there's counterfeit, there's 
true gold."

So next time you go to something that calls itself a rave but isn't, 
don't just write it all off; the real ones do exist, and why SHOULD 
they be so easy to find? And, after all, it's up to YOU to make them 
real.

Allright, we already know that raves are THE space-age tribal youth 
ritual, the return of the dionysian energy that first emerged in 50's 
rock 'n' roll and erupted in full force in the late 60's with the 
intertwining of music and psychedelic drugs. But the rave-current is 
itself only the more visible crest of something broader and 
deeper.It's no coincidence that it hits the States at the same time as 
a major resurgence of psychedelic usage.

You can take the toying with neo'60's motifs--day-glo, flowers, 
smiley faces, flares--as mere fashion recycling by a generation born 
largely post-Summer of Love. Or you can see these themes as the 
instinctual recovery of a project left hanging, next breath after a 
two decade-long lull. Or you can go ever furthur--and why not!?--and 
see "the 60's" as only one recent intrusion within the Flatland of 
(take a deep breath now) Gravity-Bound-Domesticated-Humanoid-
Industrial Civilization (got that?) of a future that is already 
happening, a future that beckons us towards itself and sends its 
echoes spiralling back through the dark and narrow tunnels of 
terrestrial time to make itself come true...

But only with your help, of course!

Picture a wave forming on the horizon, a big one (talking late 50's, 
early 60's): the psychick surfers coasting out there, beatniks, non-
conformists, oddball academics bored with the small town life at 
the shore and all its dismal soap-opera games, looking for something 
to carry them away into a wilder, richer world; the first swells of 
energy carry with them a tide of psycho-active algaes...

HOFFMAN/HUXLEY/BURROUGHS/GINSBURG/WATTS/LEARY/ALPERT/KE
SEY & CO., issue their first reports and manifestoes; munching on the 
junk food of the gods, our proto-mutants are initiated into the 
mysteries of the Vortex; they come back to the cardboard facades of 
Main Street with their evocations of kaleidoscopic infinity, eyes lit 
with the light of alien suns. Their news answers a gnawing hunger 
among so many trapped within the greypastelboxroutines of the 
industrial-consumer-democratic hive; More, they activate dormant 
circuits of the hive's nervous system, and spawn a burst of deviance: 
forms of rebellion less interested in disputing what varieties of 
greypastelboxroutines are preferable and what's right and wrong for 
everybody, than in setting up scouting parties for heading out to 
sea...

Underline the word parties.

Dosed to the gills, beatniks in existential black mutate into 
rainbow-hued hippiedom. Up with the Flower Children, hedonistic and 
'escapist'--so called because they withdrew from the arena of 
domesticated primate aggro-sports known as 'politics' in favor of 
actually learning about the infinite kingdoms within their own body 
and nervous system. Drop into the Haight, turn off powertrips, tune 
out conformism and competition. 

Meltdown ensues. All the accelerated bondings through Be-Ins, Love-
Ins, communes. Awash in the incense of oriental exoticism and 
occultist bric-a-brac, a renaissance of the spirit decks itself out in 
raiments of psychic kitsch. And how much can we fault them, really, 
if their Love&Peace trip undercut itself by becoming a denial of the 
Darkness; after all, they are there for us to learn from.

But just as everyone is tumbling about in the cosmic froth, 
anticipating revolution or millenium tomorrow afternoon at the 
latest, the Wave suddenly evaporates beneath them. No, the Earth Egg 
didn't quite hatch yet, ...just some initial stirrings. And so the 
children of the Vortex find themselves hurtling through the air like 
Wil E. Coyote, wrapped up in all their newfound lifestyles, but the 
vital juice is gone, and it all becomes so tame and lame so quickly, 
and in any case, a lot of people couldn't handle the intensity so it 
comes time to settle back into a safe routine, in some cases lay the 
ground for those who come after; & all around are the Mr. Jones' of 
many guises, panicked at the imminent collapse of Normalville; some 
however take their chance to cash in on what they can of it, a lot of 
others are wholly freaked, and thus begins a Counter-Reformation. 
One the one hand, a retreat from direct encounter with the Abyss 
crystallizes into the New Age, and on the other, it's back to the 
Bible, dumb drugs, white-bread, and Family Values. And all the 
hipsters left posing without a clue, all the 
burnouts/fuckups/addicts & victims of some invisible multi-
dimensional boogeying elephant; over there in the ivy towers, the 
blind men scribble their learned tomes, dissecting some stray 
paisley footprints; but something far stranger has happened, and its 
awfully hard to make out just what till the next, bigger cousin of 
that wave starts to surface offshore.

Meanwhile even many devotees of the Vortex ascribe it to the 
decline in quality of their psychoactive goodies, mistaking the 
portal for the vista beyond (but how do you enter the vista without 
the portal? hmmm...BE THY VISION! a distant curl of the Vortex 
whispers back).

Credit it all to upsurges of the Gaian mind, long-schemed scams of 
the giggling DNA-consciousness, or the flotsam & jetsam cast down 
by That Transcendental Novelty Item at the End of Time; choose your 
metapors--the more the merrier; but there's a mystery-in-process 
that all the nice rationalistic analyses will never get at: here I'll 
echo a point once made by Mr. Leary: the most subtle form of 
conservatism is that which views the present only through the prism 
of the past!

And yes, (to those for whom it's not patently obvious), IT'S 
HAPPENING AGAIN.

***

At the heart of the rave is a modern, technologically clad 
form of non-verbal, ecstatic communion. The ethos of 
openness, sharing, intimacy, touch and empathy--not to mention the 
pure intensities of trance itself--facilitated by the use of LSD & 
MDMA (hey, the fact that you have to take these things to loosen up 
is a sign of just how far down & lost we all are!!), in tandem with 
the all-night long pulsation of bodies to the same sound source, can 
and does create a context where layers of armoring and conditioning 
are shed, where those willing can find the joyful and mysterious 
realm of their bodies free of oh-so many enculturated ego-trips and 
bullshit, ... while also opening the "post-terrestrial" circuits of their 
psyches. (Whew! Pause, return to beginning of paragraph, read again 
slowly.)

In other words, a safe space where we can be as weird as we want 
to be.

A collective molting ritual for the new species.

***

Or take it from another angle: compare the rave-thing to a chemical 
reaction: a half-dozen ingredients (make your own list), inert & 
ordinary in the normal course of things; but combine them in right 
proportions, at the right time and place, apply the CATALYST (& 
what what THAT be?) and BOOM!, you've set off an explosion, a chain 
reaction producing ENERGY, LOTS OF IT, and in that process a 
dynamic that continues to transform many of the starting 
ingredients into new & unknown qualities. No question, of course, 
that bystanders can look in from the skeptically, and reduce it all 
back to something familiar: escapism, consumerism, fashion parade, 
whatever. But we'll leave them to their nervous calculations...

OK, so you want a schoolbook definition of TECHNO-SHAMANISM, that 
catchphrase everybody likes to invoke but no one seems to be able to 
actually explain?
Prepare to jump levels: As the individual shaman/ess evicts demons 
and excises magical darts from the sick person through a mixture of 
magickal sound & motion, so on the level of the diseased and crisis-
ridden 'global village' raves aim to heal the collective body by 
shaking it loose of its neurotic fixations and death-fetishes. 

EXORCISM THROUGH DANCE.

Unhooking the talons and shadowy webs of control. A physical 
unlearning of a few thousand years worth of BAD HABITS.

Learning to be at once a little more human and a little more alien.

Healer, leader, visionary, outcast: the shaman/ess' role is multi-
faceted, both at the center but also relegated to the margins of the 
community; the use of sound and/or psychoactive compounds are 
central to shamanism. The shaman/ess chants, hums, drums and 
dances as a way of programming hir voyage into the "spirit realms" 
(aka hyperspace), as well as of healing the mind and body of others, 
... all on a more face-to-face, way lo-tech scale, of course.

So there, chew on that for a while.

***

It's a pretty sad but predictable fact that self-professed "radicals" 
have been oblivious to this phenomenon, just because it seems to 
emanate out of NITEKLUBLAND; too bad--when will they figure out 
that all social alienation is ultimately grounded in an alienation 
from the body--that realm of nature closest to us but oh-so far 
away. Their heroine Emma Goldman once proclaimed to the grim 
socialist militants of her day: "If I can't dance in your revolution I 
want no part of it."

And what if dance could be a modality of social change?

A heretical thought, no doubt. "Free your ass and your mind will 
follow," so said George Clinton. But hey, he was just another crass 
capitalistic rock star, right?

Not to rescusitate, however, that burdensome word, Revolution. 
Scratch the R, hilite the E. Quote an obscure graffito from a wall in 
Paris, May 1968: "This is not a Revolution but a Mutation." And say 
rather, TAZ. Temporary Autonomous Zone.

Like the TAZ, the rave is wild, nomadic, outside the maps of Power. 
At its best, the rave opens onto a realm of free-form behavior and 
perception, one in which there is no hierarchy, no leaders or 
followers, at most the dj and the light-show artists. (Hopefully 
benign--be careful who you leave your sensorium with!)

...Not unlike the Situationist International's notion of the "situation" 
(sorry, I just had to drag them in here!), a space of liberated 
interactions... but where the participants are the art and the show, 
the synergy between them all the event (or event horizon?). If the 
insurrection was supposed to realize itself in a festival, we might 
ask, why shouldn't the festival turn into an insurrection--an 
insurrection of Love?

Anyone who has been part of a REAL rave, if only once, briefly, 
knows that its insane, insanely beautiful ferocity is something that 
exceeds all the contrived parlour-games that pass for alternatives, 
social or political. The mere fact of this ferocious hedonism is, 
without words or slogans, A REFUTATION OF DOMESTICATED 
EXISTENCE.

So FUCK IT if most of this California rave-scene is still ensnared in 
niteklubbism. Invade the pseudo-raves, instigate roving micro-raves. 
Doesn't take more than a ghetto blaster and a handful of courageous 
revellers to start a rave on any streetcorner or park, see how long it 
takes to catch..., or to be shut down...

THIS is OUR form of protest--our style of dance is angry and 
combative as well as loving and celebratory; to free our bodies first 
from the rotting carcass of history,,,

...and from there, ... who knows where we'll go?

***

Prediction: a few years down the road, the rave-scene will be looked 
back on as the primary networking mechanism for the tribes of star-
farers. 

But if ravers can't clean up after themselves, how are they going to 
clean up the planet?

***

DANCE

If you had to have JUST ONE metaphor for it all to live by and 
through, wouldn't that just be it. The spiral dance of life...so it 
sounds cliched, but cliched only in words, in words...

DANCE

but (& rave-friends can detour here for a sec, these are words for 
those who've never raved and long stopped going out to 

DANCE

DANCE, --this kind of dance--is FREEING MOTION. Not just moving 
to the beat but letting the beat help you throw off all the 
constricted robotic movements that have been imprinted into your 
heart, your eyes, your ears, your arms, your ass, your dreams, by all 
the tricks, traumas & seductions of society; and find the REAL YOU; 
dancing with the world, but dancing off the consensus-trance, that 
narrow greyout rightangle robotic updown freezeframe pseudo-
reality.

Raves signal the return to Western culture of sacred dance. A dance 
that balances discipline with excess, ecstasy with focus. Look at the 
three great Monotheisms that have pretty much defined our psycho-
somatic matrix: Judaism, Christianity, Islam: none of them possess 
any tradition of Sacred movement; they have all been scared shitless 
of the Body, and have instituted its repression in a thousand and one 
subtle ways. How appropriate that the advent of a spiritualized form 
of movement to the center of Civilization should present itself in a 
totally decadent, seemingly profane form. And people wonder why 
raves are actively suppressed back in the UK? Raves represent the 
primal life-force suppressed so long ago it remains only a dim but 
real memory.

And let's get this out of the way too: dancing on a decent dose of a 
psychedelic is something else again: communing with the animal 
spirits encoded into the depths of your skin, letting them out of 
their millenial cages. Learning how you can be each of them when 
you need to be; and its also about learning how to fly, how to turn 
yourself inside out into a spinning glowing disc, though that's a 
little harder ... and then, once we've got that under our belts, we can 
do it TOGETHER.

It's been said before, but not clearly enough: UFOS R US.

***

So what if all this prepacked ravitis costs too much. Don't leave it 
to them and whine about how commercialized it all is: THROW YOUR 
OWN! AND MUTATE IT WHILE YOU'RE AT IT! 

So some of the dinosaurs may not be happy seeing their way of life 
superseded and want to stamp out those noisy critters scampering 
between their feet; more intelligence and greater manoueverability 
will be our response. Haven't we gotten sick enough of the Enemy-
Production Line?

Social transmutation can be fun too, right? There's fun, safe vapid 
alcoholic-nicoteine hedonism, letting off steam so you can return to 
Monday; and then there's fun that aims high, fun allied with Will. The 
path of disciplined excess (??).

But watch this--all those scouting parties of the future will be 
known by their capacity to throw great parties--and pioneer 
partying as a way of throwing off the legacy of the miserable 
Dominator culture we've all had to grow up in.

***

RAVERS, look a little ways forward: have you wondered yet what 
happens once you're burnt out after a year or two of intensive raving, 
once you've lost half your hearing, the beats become stale, and the 
Energy has leaked away. Where, what then?

Define the rave for me.

What does the verb TO RAVE really mean to you?

But first let's list all the stuff that seems to go with it: 
Acid/techno/deep house music; dancing from dusk to dawn; hi-tech 
light shows; lollipops, floppyhats, dayglo pendants, smart drinks; 
$15-20 tickets; zillion gigagawatts sound-systems; X,a cid, nitrous 
and 2CB; goofy outfits, sexy bodies; so many inane and beatific 
smiles...

SHALL we ask together: just what is the essence of a rave?

Suppose, just for a second that we subtract one by one each of the 
above accessories. Stretch your imagination to the limit, and take 
away even, yes, even THE MUSIC; till all we have left are the people, 
all those people who have found each other in this beat, in these 
hidden gatherings, but without the beat, just heartbeat, pulserate, 
breath, ... AND THE EXCHANGE OF LOVE-ENERGIES (isn't that what sex 
is, ultimately?) and each other's presence ... Radiant and revelling in 
our unearthly beauty ... so here we are: much as we adore it, do we 
really need the dance music to affirm our commonality, the patent 
fact that we are siblings of the the same spiritual family who 
through the raves have managed to find one another and in that 
finding remember who each of us truly is, orphan child of eternity. 
Do we need to confuse the rave with the quality of our common 
presence, our moving-loving together; can't we take the essence of 
the rave, freed of all the externals we associate with it, transfer 
and apply that energy elsehwere, to just about anything...?

It comes down to a challenge, a challenge posed in that leap from 
normal space to hyperspace that kicks in when the 'rave' really 
starts to rave: those altered moments when each of us in being 
truest to our uniqueness enters into a harmonious whole; elusive as 
this may be, it calls out, and asks to be realized in every moment of 
our lives; it asks for creation, CREATION OF LIFE, for the nurturing 
of real communities that last deeper & longer than a few hours on 
the dancefloor.

That creative energy, apply it not just to your style of dress but to 
your style of BEING. Free eros & intimacy from the shackles 
socially-inherited sexualities (gay vs, straight, male vs. female), 
from monogamy and the neurotic fixation on genital sexuality: 

YES, CELEBRATE your arrival here at last after a long trek, but don't 
forget, this is only the point of departure. These parties are our 
loading docks and shipyards. (And there is Work to be done: enough 
healing & cleaning for us all.) Here is where we will build not just a 
House, but a ship of dreams, a starship. Woven out of LOVE. CHAOS. 
LAUGHTER.IMAGINATION. WILL. 

And embark; post-nuclear families setting sail out along the 
unwinding multi-dimensional origami strands of alternity...

Our motto:

UTOPIA OR BUST.

OK, maybe "real" and "unreal" aren't the right words to use.  There's
a lot of wus "dinner jazz" on KJAZ or KBLX that bores me silly too. But
I still don't like most acid jazz, it reminds me too much of the kind of

Y' know, I noticed a long time ago that "non-ravers" were wearing a lot
of stereotypically rave fashion (bright ski hats, suspenders, striped
shirts, etc.), when it finally dawned on me that maybe ravers per se aren't
the trendsetters, but are just wearing clothes that are becoming hip

Someone said:

 As a form of individualistic artistic expression, I find bare
 bodies to be relatively boring unless accentuated by tatoos, 
 piercings, scars/mutilations, prostetheses or other artificial
 enhancements.

Clothes are even more boring after a while.  I find looking at other 
bodies to be, on the whole, more interesting -- and often more revealing
(in a general way, natch).  If more people went around nekkid this would
no doubt change.

The mods you mentioned are neat too, but what about body paint?  Clothes
are not permanent and the stuff you mentioned is.  It's one thing to wear 
pants with a big lizard skeleton on them; it's another to have the same 
design tattooed on your leg.  I can take off my pants.

I agree that most people have boring or downright unattractive bodies.
By interesting or attractive I don't mean "thin to the point of
anorexia" or "buffed w/steroids" either, just that most people are not
healthy and their bodies show it.  The standard 20th century diet of
poisonous crap; sedentary indoor life; a gene pool that has not had to
deal with natural selection for several hundred years; all these take
their toll on the average Skinny White Boy(tm) and MallGirl(tm).

  And while it is true that body builders sculpt 
 their muscle structure as a form of art, such expressions are still 
 rather limited to the limits imposed by basic human biology.
 Clothing and ornaments by their very nature enable us to express
 ideas and feelings that transcend our animal selves even when only
 simple colors and textures are used, let alone interesting patterns
 and symbols.

Raving seems to me to be a deep dive into the animal self, or at least one 
part of it.

  When I rave, among other things, I like sensory
 stimulation.  When I see a shirtless guy at a rave, I see, at
 best, mammal-who-may-be-hot-or-is-just-proud-to-be-a-mammal.  I
 find this form of expression stiflingly uncreative.

 - leg of eel

The first is a utilitarian gesture unrelated to aesthetics.  The second
isn't necessarily bad, just usually.  See my third paragraph.

It's too bad that nudity is such a serious taboo in our culture, and that
sexual relations have deteriorated through isolation to the point that
many people do not feel safe without clothes, even in the best of 
environments.

well, i deliberately used the word "manifesto" in describing the text.
doesn't it remind you of the communist manifesto just a little bit?
only the means of change are different.  i had actually hoped to spark
some discussion over whether or not change can be effected via
organized vibrations of air molecules (also known as music), rather
than whether or not the choice of words was fortunate or not.

some thoughts: is rave music more than just a disposable entertainment
medium?  can it be a vehicle for social change?  every good social and
cultural force needs a MELODY YOU CAN HUM.  where would ameriKKKa be
without the star spangled banner, or america the beautiful?  wars are
fought with catchy soundtracks (although we didn't get anything for
the gulf war.  i doubt anybody will be romanticizing that one with a
"battle of new orleans" style folk song.  personally, i feel cheated.)

where would the SF rave scene be without the ANTHEMS that surface
periodically? (passion and mighty ming leap to mind.  dare i even
mention the UVC?)  slogans are cool but MUSIC penetrates to a deeper
level of the brain.  how many times do you go home with slogans
running around your head?  how many times do you go home with TUNES
running around your head?  i just came from a totally dull meeting
with a nine inch nails song permanently lodged in my lobes.  music
just gets inside you unlike anything else.  i'm humming "wish there
was something real" to myself day and night.  is your average factory
worker humming "workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose
but your chains" as he drives his chevy home from the steelworks?  i
doubt it.

techno music is especially cool for getting inside your head because
you've got both the left and right hemispheres stimulated - the right
brain appreciates the bizarre noises and the left brain appreciates
the clockwork rhythm.  not to mention the incessant repetition of
phrases can induce a trancelike state and thus penetrate even DEEPER.
hands up all those who have ever left a rave with a repeated phrase
jammed in their skull - for me, all summer i kept hearing the vocal
from los kings del mambo.  attending any rave where londres strut got
played guaranteed i'd be mumbling "bassline kickin' yes i'm groovin'"
for a day or two afterwards.

as a bold experiment in mass communication and aggressive marketing,
the forthcoming uvc track will feature the phrase "buy a UVC record
today" repeated for the duration of the track at subliminal volume.

i'll let you know how it works.

Hi Brian,

I'm wondering if your plans for x-country skiing in Yosemite are still
happening.  When you first posted I didn't think I would be able to get the
time off then so I didn't reply.  Now it looks like I could.  If you already
have everything booked, let me know if any space opens up.

Thanks

Just so everyone knows, yes, there is still room for more people to go
X-country-skiing (that's CROSS-country, where are your minds :) in 
Yosemite from January 8th to the 10th.  The cost will only be $40 total
for 2 nights, not including food or ski rentals.  You won't have to miss
any school or work to make it, and the full moon rave is the night before.
Also, I'll be bringing up my turntables and sound system, so there will
be raving at night :)  If you're still interested let me know...

Hey I get soaked with sweat cuz I'm dancing like a fiend for 3 - 5 hours
that's why I wear spandex, If I were into rave ware

	1. I would find Overalls too constricting to my movement.
	2. They wouldn't feel to good after an 1 being drenched with sweat
	3. There's nothing worse than cold wet longsleve shirts after
	   a heavy workout.

I generally take a set of dry clothes with me to change into in the morning,
when I'm chilling out I sorta like the raveware stuff but refuse to pay
$30 - $40 for a oversized T-shirt that's not so oversized on me.

Although I must admit overalls for outdoor winter raving beats spandex 
hands down!

I was talking to my NYC bro-in-law a while back and he was telling me
about his friend/ex-band-mate's PhD study of australian aboriginal
tribal music and dance.

The interesting thing to note is that the aborigines don't have a
written history. Their history is passed on from generation to generation
via song and dance. The dances are ritualistic cathartic, trance-like ...
There's more to it than that in that the music itself has some linguistic
aspects to it, but I ain't no linguist (tho i am a cunning stuntman).

Perhaps there's a parallel here between the power of music as a
recitative and mnemonic stimulus; a framework for remembering emotions,
events, and facts. 

And perhaps we're accessing that primitive music/dance/ritual/catharsis
locus in our brains when we rave? And perhaps that's why the stuff
sticks around in our heads so long after the stimuLus is gone.

 RE: The Need For Violence To Achieve A Good Goal

 Violence is one of many tools that can be used to achieve
a goal. It is a seductive tool - coupled with self-rightousness
and vengence, it can turn into an end in itself. However, the 
way the world presently works, and will probably continue to
work for the near future ( next 50 -80 years ) , is that an
established power , arrogantly confident in the rightness of the
way things are - can sometimes only be brought to a re-assesment
of it's assumptions by drastic means. Or, the established power
itself is shown to be quite willing to use overt and covert violence
to maintain the status quo, or to expand the boundaries of it's power.

 Violence on the plebian, "street" level is usually useless, because
it is passionate - without thought for consequences. The "hits" of
organized crime are closer to political violence, but the aims are
always related to base motives. Terrorist actions have lofty goals
behind them, but usually hurt the claws and fangs of the establishment
hardly at all.

 For proper social change , after all avenues have been exhausted, I
think civil war is the most useful type of violence ; and defensive
war as weel, of course. Civil war : by definition, a large segment
of the population is of a like mind, unlike terrorism. Also, the
leaders of a civil war are usually much more plausible leaders of the
nation than terrorists.

DISCLAIMER: It's late , so I'm tired, and I'm ill, so all cylinders
may not be clicking - And, I'm no history expert; the above are just
my two cents ( well, maybe 15 cents) on the subject...

BTW Jon - If violence is the only truly creative act, what about 
 the UVC single?

I'll make sure to avoid you on the dance floor :)
Some places are designed to bring out every last drop of sweat
that you have in your body, (1015 Folsom st.) I  personally am glad
that I can sweat, it is my body's guarantee to my psyche that it 
won't collapse from heat stroke as I put it through its paces.  The ability
to sweat is indeed a mixed blessing.  My body does tend to keep itself
rather cool at the expense of not looking cool.  I remember reading somewhere
that when the british were controling india, that they tried to select men
who could perspire cuz' the one who could would most certainly die of heat
stroke.  As far as wet, stinky bodies, well let me just say that for me
the smell of female sweat (as long as she had a shower sometime that day :)
is a tremendous turn-on and that they can bump their wet, "stinky" bodies
into me on the dancefloor anytime.

I really like the women who are "speaker tweakers" like me, who 
become virtual "slaves to the rhythm".  The only reason I don't take
my shirt off regularly is that I have too much middle-age fat around
my torso, who knows maybe if I went to the gym more...

P.S. Rox, I'm not making fun of you or your position and I do understand
it.  Some people just don't like sweat.

Interesting statement.  Can you come up with an example of animal behavior

behaviors, although my dancing activities do not contain much sexual

At the very least, music reflects the social changes that are taking
place.  Often, music (and other art forms) can reinforce social change.
There are probably many examples of art forms leading to social change,
One that comes to mind: MTV -> shortened attention spans.

What I thing is especially mind expanding about techno music is how
it delivers to us a paradoxical dichotomy of stimuli.  This cold, 
mechanical, synthetic, mathematically precise music can evoke feelings of
the biorythmical and cyclical forces of nature that are within us, and 
all around us.  This is why it combines so well with tribal music, which
has been a part of the way humans have experienced the oneness of cosmic
(i.e. spiritual) and gutterral (i.e. individualistic, animal) awareness.

Techno music brings together the farthest reaches of human experience.
Today, that mathematics of modern physics are revealing understandings
about the universe that may seem incredibly abstract and removed from
reality, like the electrons that run through the oscillators of our
synthesizers.  But these laws of physics happen describe what we are 
fundamentally made of, and so, techno music can be seen to be as
natural sounding as the human voice, just at a different, more basic
level.  Combining techno with voice samples and other sounds helps
bring all the different levels of human experience together.  That's
when I dance to it I feel like almost EVERY aspect of my existence is
dancing with it.

As far as being a vehicle for social change, I'm in favor of anything 
that can make us more aware of ourselves and our universe, even
sublimally.

	When I'm caught up in the joy of raving, I'm celebrating
	my entire being, part of which is indeed an "animal". But we
	humans, for the good or ill of the rest of the species that we
	co-habitate with on this planet, have the ability to "think and
	make tools". This is what seperates us from all the other critters.
	(I can be validly argued that dolphins are more mentally advanced
	than we are but they can't make tools to exploit that superiority,
	hmmm.)  Anyway, one of the problems with dominant culture on the planet
	is that it, sometimes violently, enforces a split between our Bodies
	and our Minds.  Yes, when I'm on the dance floor, I'm sexual and
	spiritual (They really are the same thing, think about it) and
	analytical and synthetical and rational and intuitive and all of the
	wonderful things that it means to be human.  I am an animal and because
	of that I do have sexual drives and urges but because I'm also
	a human, I can think that I wan't to rip that woman's cloths off
	and NOT be compelled to act on my desire.  This is the key and the
	lesson that we have to learn as a species, to be able to completely
	integrate the "animal and the divine" as the neo-platonist would
	call this duality split.  When we can be masters of both of these
	areas in our lives without repressing either, then we can make
	the next evolutionary leap.  Raving is the beginning of that process.
	Sort of like shedding of an old skin.  We're still learning how
	to just BE with each other through all of our preconceived ideas,
	programming, instincts, fears. Shit, we as a race have hundreds of
	thousands (if not millions) of years of stuff to sort out and
	rectify and we don't have much time to do it in.  At A rave, so much 
	information is being processed by our biocomputers, its incredible!
	I'm sure the real long term effects will not be felt for maybe
	20 - 30 years but rest assured they WILL BE FELT.  Just like the
	effects of the 60's are finally making it into government now.
	It's our job to try to keep the planet together and alive until
	we as a culture/age-group/meme can "jack into" the global planetary
	matrix, (it's not about control anymore, it's like flying the
	space shuttle, if you get into trouble, take your hand off the stick
	and the ship will do the right thing) Enjoy raving while it lasts,
	it's only a beginning, and eventually when we learn how to tolerate/
	party/mate with different types of people then comes the real work of
	communicating and healing the wounds that we have inflicted on each 
	other and on the planet.

Well, for a start, there's the purina cat chow commercials...

And then there's the rat-experiments where they continually
self-administer amphetamines or cocaine while forgetting to eat, drink,
or otherwise do the sorts of things that rats like to do.

And then there's lemmings as they hurl themselves off a cliff,
monkeys-in-zoo gibbering with excitement as they fling excrement at
passers-by.

Did I tell you the time I visiting the new orleans zoo and I saw a bat
giving himself a blow-job while hanging upside down? Quite impressive!

to communicate the direction and location of that sweEet&deLicious

Forgive me for picking nits, but isn't "subliminal awareness" an
oxymoron?  Subliminal stimuli by definition take place beneath
the level of consciousness...

When I go into that trance-like state at raves, I'm not at all sure
that my awareness of the world or myself is necessarily expanded,
just transformed, as if I were undergoing hypnosis.

Hello again, friends.  Forgive me from re-emerging(?) from the murky-lurky

of the time I'm transported (watch out, quasi-dream sequence ahead!) into

only "seeing" fonky(I mean FONKY!) shapes and color schemes.  It is over-
whelmingly pleasant and all the while I'm dancing my butt off.  Far, far in 
the distance through a misty cloud I'm aware of people and surroundings..
Okay, dream sequence dissolving...

It comes from a rather dubious start, to my knowledge.  Ya see, in a lot of
the eastern detention houses, aka prison for minors and many outright prisons
the inmates are not allowed belts.  The buckles are easily converted into 
weapons and the leather is often an invitation to Hari-Kari.  Thus, a guy in 
the depths tends to lose a bit of weight and his pants start to sa-sa-saggin'.
Most of the guys(in my neighborhood and probably a lot of others) who made it
back onto the street were sort of cult-heroes.  They maintained a swagger and
very baggy pants (belt now optional).  It caught on not so much as fad, but 
as emulation.  Call it misguided, but 'tis reality.

	Okay, so i was stuck back home in Indiana and decided to make the 
most of it by paying a visit to David Nichols, Professor of Pharmacology, who
wrote the intro to Pihkal and is involved in studying potential new/alternative
empathogens.  A little nervous since i wasn't sure how he felt about total
strangers coming to bother him.  I thought i might be able to convince him to
take a look at the X-faq sheet though, and see if he thought the data accurate
or maybe add something.
	Anyway, it went _much_ better than i had expected.  i'm sending him
the X-faq to get his comments.  But, but, but, there's much more!
	He's trying to set up an entire (and completely legal) research 
institute which,to quote a rough draft of the prospectus, "is based on the
belief taht the multidisciplinary, legitimate, and scientifically sound 
investigation of psychedelic agents holds great potential for producing
genuine breakthroughs in the understanding of the human mind."  He believes
thatthis must be "an independent research Institute, whose operations and 
on-going research programs are not dependent on government funding."  A
institute with grass-roots funding , in other words.
	So, he's interested in contacting as many people as possible that
would be interested in funding such an institute, as individuals or as 
funding agencies/corporations.  Doesn't know much about the Net, but is 
interested in getting word out through it.
	He plans to send out full prospectus, etc. sometime early 1993.  But 
he's interested in what the response from the Net community would be.  
Which is why i'm posting this as a sort of trial run.  What do you all think?
He doesn't have e-mail, so i'm planning to gather responses and bring a
printout back to him in a couple days.
	Oh, one last thing.  I told him i'd call him back tonight and let him
know about preliminary response.  But i won't have net access tonight.  So
could someone (hint: Brian) call me at my parents and let me know what people
think in general?  i'll be there by about 8 PM California time. Number is

Subject: Amature technogeek turns pro


So after fooling around with electronic music for the past 15 years,
I reluctantly decided to try something in the Techno/Rave vein, like
the world needs yet another synth-drum machine-sampler-midi musician.
But I figure since I like this kind of music anyway, I might as well
put my slant on the genre and throw it into the fray.  Surely I couldn't
do any worse than my pathetic attempt at breaking into the new age arena
5 years ago (submissions to 15 record companies, positive responses - 0).

Due to lack of stamps and the lack of motivation to deal with the post 
office this time of year, I send out only one tape; contaioning one 
techno/dance and one techno/ambient to Mark of Darwin Chamber who is
with, or partly owns, Collision Records.  A couple of days later I get 
a call from Mark who seems rather excited about the first song.  He  wants
to put it out on a 4-song EP with 3 other artists.  He'll have a contract
for me in a few weeks, I'll get some percentage points and the record will 
be out in 3 months.  The only catch is that it needs to be remixed with
a "more monotonous" beat containing a stronger kick drum.  He doesn't
want to cramp my style, but it has to be "more boring" in order to sell.
Do I have a TR-909?  Uh, no, just a wimpy 707.  It turns out that
Collision Records is located above BPM, which is just a couple of blocks
away from my apartment.  So he offers to come over with his 909 and a 
mixing board as soon as he's done with a bunch of other stuff.  I am totally
agreeable.

So, does anyone know these guys, or have any advice for me.  Michael, Jon?
This is all very new and I'm pretty excited.  The money doesn't matter,  
but if this offer really pans out, I'd certainly want to continue putting 
out music.  I remember hearing somewhere that Mark from Darwin Chamber is
the same guy as Markie Mark the DJ.  Is this true?  Does anyone know where 
I can buy a TR-909?

If you want to look at History, how about the recent USSR break up,
 if the russian people didn't put themselves in front of the tanks
 and asked the soldiers to join them in resisting, 
but instead threw malotov(SIC) cocktails at
the soldiers forcing them to fight, would the coup fail so fast?
Look at the violence in North Ireland, Yugoslavia, etc. They had been
fighting for years, did they get anything out of it. 
As for destruction as entertainment, it is fun for all only when the object
destroyed is yours, vandelism pisses me off. It is a senseless
act and it achieves nothing.

On shirtless sweaty guys:
	I like nice bodies. Anyone can buy nice clothes or people
can wear the same clothes (making your own clothes is way cool and
an exception), but your body is unique and yours to keep. If you look after it,
 it can be firm and beautiful, if you abuse it, it can look ugly.
 I like looking at nice bodies. Sweating people bumping into me
 only bothers me when either I am not sweating or the person stinks.
 When I am comfortable with the
surrounding, I sometimes take my shirt off when I get
too hot (and wear a vest and/or bra), no one seems to mind.

On trancing out in a dance:
	I took some psych classes in college and remember something about
mindlessness in repetitive behaviour, such as driving to work (the same
route) every morning, running in circles on the track, etc. It is there
so that the mind can rest and won't go crazy out of boredom.(But psych
is just theory anyway). I used to run in the track (800m) and to train
I had to jog in circles on the track for hours, first 30 minutes, I
got tired and uncomfortable, after a while, I got the rhythum, and
just kept going. The mind went to a blissful blank and endophins ran high.
skiing is similar, except shorter: down a steep chute, if your body can
keep up (not collapse from lack of air), it is great fun to let go and
react to the snow as your skis hit the snow. There is no room for
conscious thoughts or even time to think about how to do certain turns,
you just do it. The subconscious does all the work, if you break out of
the trance before you hit the flats, you would probably fall.
 Martial arts emphasizes on the body learning movements by repetition.
Dancing to music with a heavy beat works at 2 levels:
1) Music induces mindlesssness, when the music is loud
enough and the beat strong enough, it can inhibit the mind from forming 
conscious thought, as the music will constantly distract the mind from
concentration. Try studying diffential topology while playing motorhead
at the correct sound level (120 db).
2) The body movement provides the exercise. With enough exercise,
 it is possible to get the endophins running just like jogging.
What I am trying to say is that dancing can give you the same high
 faster than running with the help of strong music.

On a different note, Sharkbait is emphasize on their music again
and not the theatricals as much. For those who never saw them,
this is the industrial band with 
the most mellow friendly crowd, everyone gets a drumstick and play
along on scrap metal. Or DESTROY tvs in the crash cage. I have been
following them on and off since 91'when they played with Taiko dojo (SF)
 and they are great. Check them out.

Um, Phoebe, have you been keeping up with the events in Georgia SSR or
the Baltic States?  There has been a large amount of violence.

Please don't take this wrong, but you are a) in good physical shape
and b) attractive.  If someone like, say, Big Rick Stewart from Live
105 were to dance around topless and bump sweatily into people,  a lot
of people would probably mind.

Y'know, I was just reading my last post on shirts or lack of, and it
occurred to me that it read as sort of bitchy and assholish and
unravelike.  Sorry 'bout that.  My brain reacts in weird ways when it
realizes that I can't make me and everyone else happy at the same
time.  When I read someone say that something I like to do is a turn
off, i go thru some rather violent cognitive battles, which is
reflected in my writing.  I'll be nice now.

Not that I'm gonna stop sweating all over everyone.

OK, hope everyone i shaving a good time at the Ministry concert.  Wish
I was there, but I saw them in Chicago a month ago and I thought maybe
I didn't need to see them twice on one tour.  Yeah, right, who am I

Not any one "style".  If you can call it a style, I guess whatever

Followed closely by thrash (Ministry, Slayer) adn pseudo-white-

rave music (i admit I like some of the more commercial stuff, and I
also like Spun and Moonpup's stylings, esp. that Prefab Sprout song
remixed by a certain SFRavre...)

Very interesting.  I've always found Darwin Chamber's music to have a kick drum
that's too boring and too loud.

Subject: Re: trance-like states


Well I had to think about this a little before answering.  Phoebe's
post also clarified somethings for me so here it goes.

I can go into a few different altered states at raves, with or without
chemical assist.  Chemicals make it easier to access certain states but
for me are by no means necessary.

The first state is just sort of a grove state, it's melllow and rythmic
but my thought process is still working, I can carry on conversations
and meet new people, my body is usually not warmed up and is in
a sort of baseline mode.  This state is generally where I am within
10 minutes of being in a rave.

The second state is one of what I call "burning trance" I call it this
because it usually comes after my body has warmed up and my energy
system has "come on", For you SM types I guess my blood is fully oxigenated
and my muscles are fully warm and limber.  My mind is in a state similar
to that of driving a car, it can handle all the info comming in from "outside"
but can also process internal dialogs, the difference here is that my thoughts
tend to be very abstract and connected with the music that I'm experiencing,
I cann it burning trance because I get a sort of burning stare and my body
is "on fire" (even without E) At the best raves, this is the baseline state.

The third state is that of the "love grove" this is a state of deeper trance
when I start "sending".  The head mounted Phaser is in full effect :) and
there is generally some ego loss.  This is not a stable condition and I will
not stay in this state for extended periods.

The fourth state is of possession or "going-out", this has only happened to 
me maybe 5 or 6 times.  I generally experience my  consciousness "stepping
asside" and "another force" takes over my body for a period of time.  I can
watch what happens but I'm not doing it.  There is a feeling of timelessness
associated with this state and often when I "come to" I'm disorientated
and a little flustered, I often have to go and chill out immediately and try
to integrate into the rest of my consciousness what just happened.  This
can happen with or without Chemicals but the chemicals will increese the
chance of it happening on any given rave.  The energy of the rave is also
a key factor.  There is total ego loss during the time of possession.
Is this what happened when my yoruba ancestors danced the dances that
"drew down " the Ifa' spirits?

KNOTT'S BERRY SETS HOLIDAY JAM BUT MAYBE IT SHOULD STICK TO JELLY
By David J. Jefferson -- Staff Reporter for the journal

	Every trend-setter knows that once something hits the mass market,
its no longer hip. Take Peter Max. Disco. Junk Bonds.
	So the avant-garde may have to give up "raves", huge, all-night
dance parties.  Because on New Year's Eve, "K-Rave '93", a rave to end all
raves, will be held at Knott's Berry Farm, the Buena Park, Calif., theme
park that jelly built.
	Heretofore, raves have been mostly underground affairs, often held
illegally in abandoned warehouses and other remote locations, and
attracting thousands of young people dressed in neo-hippie and faux-gang
garb.  Rave revelers gyrate to lyricless computerized music called
"techno", drop amino acid in the form of vitamin-enriched "smart drinks",
and pop the occasional, illicit "ectasy" tablet.  The atmosphere is equal
parts '60s psychedelia and '90s urban street culture:  If rocker Grace
Slick and rapper Marky Mark got their friends together, it would be a rave.
	That's not at all what you would expect to find at Knott's, which
for years has shunned raucous New Year's revelry in favor of its
"Jubilation" evening of contemporary Christian music.  But the devout have
been fewer in number, and Knott's needed a revenue-booster.
	The Knott family was uncomfortable with the idea of letting
teenagers dressed like the Mad Hatter and go-go dancers invade the park,
but Dan Anderson, the 22 year-old great-grandson of founder Walter Knott
and a raver himself, convinced them that it could hold a rave sans the
seedier elements.  "You don't have to worry about dirty lyrics, because
rave music has no lyrics," says Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville.
	Won't a Knott's Berry Farm rave be like a Muzak rendition of "Like
a Virgin"?  Knott's doesn't think so.  In keeping with the latter-day
Renaissance Faire flavor of other raves, Knott's will populate the park
with bizarre street performers: a snake charmer, tribal dancers, atheletes
on Stairmaster machines, Vegas-style showgirls riding Snoopy floats.
"We're juxtaposing elements in a surrealistic way,"  says Jeff Langley, a
one-time collaborator with feminist folk singer Holly Near and now Knott's
director of entertainment.  He's hoping that "hokey becomes hip."
	The hip crowd may show up simply to poke fun.  But Knott's will
have the last laugh:  Each raver will have paid $27.50 to attend.

Subject: Connection Video

To counteract the nausea caused by Brian's message about Knott's Berry,
here's some really good news...

I've finally acquired a copy of the video shot by the Nitty Gritty Video
Collective during last summer's Connection -- Brian and I got to watch
it just before he left for L.A.  What a rad x-mas present!  ;^)

Among the highlights of the video are 2 or 3 minutes of Carlos
cutting back and forth between two copies of Los Kings de Mambo
("I'm so in love with you girl") interleaved two beats apart!
They seemed to capture all the musical highlights (UVC, Mighty
Ming, Hypnosis, etc.) and there's the obligatory shot of the waves
lapping at the Bonny Doon shore.

A few but not a whole lot of SFRavers are in there:  I spotted Jon,
Doom, Paul Thomas, and a couple of others.

Although I paid a somewhat stiff $50 for this 20-minute memento (more
than reasonable as compensation for NGVC's work), all of you out there
can both get a copy for your own libraries, and help me defray the
cost as follows:

You can have your own first-generation copy (from the Hi-8 master, not
from my VHS dub) for the cost of 

	$10 + ($40 / N) + (cost of VHS blank)

where N is the number of people who order, plus one (so I contribute
an equal share of the expense).

In other words, if three of you order, the cost will be $20 + blank tape,
if seven order it will be $15 + blank tape, etc.  You can provide the
blank tape, or just pay the "going rate" for one (I'll have to look into
that).

The $10 is the NGVC charge for the dubbing.

I'm looking into having a screening at Zanzibar, or anywhere else where
someone has access to a video projector (any ideas?)  Would people prefer
a weeknight, or weekend afternoon (or SFR Lunch?)  Should we wait 'til
after the holidays?

NGVC also has excellent videos of various FMR's, Gatherings, etc.  We
can probably add some of those to the screening.

Now for some less-than-good news.  A couple of people posted about
the police presence at the last Wicked.  It turns out that they
started asking random people to produce their ID's, and caught
something like seven underaged participants.  Subsequently they
slapped a big fine on the management of Townsend, who apparently
are taking it out of the doorman's salary.  So if you find the
doormen there more ornery than usual, you now know why!

Wondering why our public servants are being deployed to harass
raves instead of, say, protecting us from carjackings?  Why ask why?

Subject: Re:  Knott's Farm..

Hmm... my thoughts go both ways about something like this.  Were I to
be in LA over New Year's I might be tempted to go just to see (something
between appreciating it as a rave and something similar to driving
slowly past a bad traffic accident to gawk).

On the anti- side.  Yes, this is going to be a BIG affair, and very
rarely do I have fun anymore at raves with >1000 people.  There will
be very little sense of community, more a sense of "wow, it's Knotts
Berry farm, only it's in the middle of the night, and they have some
cool music going, and I might even feel comfortable dosing here".  The
price is exorbitant compared to most raves (and especially compared to
what raves _should_ cost, which is not more than $10), and this is
a gross example of corporate entities trying to cash in on the vibe.
The media attention will most likely be negative, especially if people
dose unwisely and paramedics are called in and someone sues KNotts or
the promoters.

BUT

Realize that $27.50 is only about $10 more than the normal admission to
Knotts.  According to the article they are going to go full-out on making
sure that there's lots of "interesting stuff" going on, that the rides
will be operating, etc.  If you stop trying to think of it as a spiritual
experience and more like I said before, "wow, it's Knotts Berry Farm,
only it's in the middle of the night, and they have some cool music going,
cool music going, and I might even feel comfortable dosing here".  The
vibe may even be there at spots, who knows?  As long as we have our small
warehouse parties, our full moon beach parties, our just-larger-than-
get-togethers-but-not-quite-rave raves, I say let the corporates try and
find out what we're all about.  Maybe I'm too apt to give people the benefit
of the doubt.  Maybe I just ate a big piece of chocolate and feel too good
about the world at this moment who knows.  As long as the press is good, I
don't think it;ll hurt.  Besides, are raves something we want to share with
thousands if not millions of other people?  If so then this sort of thing
is unavoidable...  

If they deliver the goods, and the majority of the people who go are happy,
then kudos to the promoters.  

I think I'll go rent "Woodstock" tonight..

Subject: This week's RAVE guide


	Well, this is the SMALLEST calendar in a while; I had a flyer for
something called "Love American Style" for Saturday night but I left it
at home in Berkeley (I'm writing this from LA). I suggest using this
opportunity to check out the weeklies (and see if all of them even exist!
hee hee).  Ah well, chalk it up to the holidays.

	I want to say thanks to everyone for making the past 10 months 
absolutely mindblowing for me.  I wish I could send each and everyone
one of you exactly what you want from santa :)  Your conversation, support,
and love have been the greatest gifts anyone's ever given me.  See everyone
at the Gathering!!!

	Brian

Subject: VIZINE: december 92: DJ LIME 2/7

DJ Lime from the U.K.'s SL2

SL2 is probably best known in the states 4 the silver disk import on
a ragga tip - 1 of the 1st widely distributed tracks 2 ^nd a sharing
ground between breakbeat house & regg>. an upcoming domestictly
released remix of on a ragga tip has DJ Lime very excited. afterall,
heUs on the same import label (XL) as breakbeat chartbusters, the
prodigy. heUs seen their success, & knows the power the sped up
hip-hop drum tracks have 2 move a crowd. in the uk, breakbeat is the
take control style of the moment w/ DJ Lime as 1 of its most
well-known & respected pioneers. Lime is convinced 1 national hit
will put breakbeat on the scene in force in the u.s. & he hopes
ragga tip will B that cut. in the u.k. breakbeat has been on the
rise 4 2 or 3 years, crowds the size of 39,000 bob their heads
across 4 square mile, 4 sound system events while Lime mixes the
boom-tis, boom-tis of a Swicked ruff rhythmS. Why is it taking so
long 2 cross 2 the states? Lime explains the comparatively small
size of the u.k. makes a trend a rather easy & total process once it
begins in any scene. the u.s. is another marketing world altogether,
rich in its own styles, its own trends moving across the coasts @
slowed down speeds. Lime sees the u.k. as a bit ahead: while many in
america R still getting used 2 a space devoted 2 phun across social
barriers, that consciousness has begun 2 wear off 4 the crowds Lime
knows, not because the project of peace & love failed, but because
everyone has ^nally begun 2 accept it as what should B going on in
the sober normal. likewise the americans still focus on the trance
rhythms of the boom boom boom. & while Lime knows their power &
vibe, he feels they can only bring U 2 a peak & carry U along that
trance line. breakbeat, however undulates & adds a percussive depth
moving dancers in & out of different rhythmic spaces. Lime has been
2 the u.s. once b4 2 spin in l.a. he dOsnUt change his approach 4 an
american audience, & he feels, @ least in l.a., they respond well.
he left a day b4 the king riots, from 1 of the hotels subsequently
damaged. peace & love in the sober normal remains only related in
certain places on the underground of multiple layers of injustice,
pain, & legitimate anger

DJ Dag from Frankfurt's Dance 2 Trance

listening 2 Dag spin is an intense trip through the frequency
modulation & steady beat underpinnings of a trance/dance tourguideUs
focused navigation of deep rhythms feelable right in in the bosom.
Dag de^nes 2 sorts of DJs: the club DJ & the mix DJ. the mix DJ
hurriedly alternates between cuts, creating new sounds &
combinations with the start of every bridge. the club DJ has a
relationship 2 each track & wants it 2 work the crowd through its
own peaks & changes. i guess the distinction is like soloist 2
conductor, & Dag places himself as a conductor. perhaps he is so
attentive 2 the ways a track works with itself because he writes, &
produces, he lays out tracks as totalities, stories 2 B told 2 an
audience, & cutting them up 2 tell new ones is not something in his
style. his ^rst release was called hanta yo. itUs sioux 4 the joker.
Dag says heUs very involved w/ native american issues, & was
attending an anti-columbus day demonstration when he me the people
who would eventually B responsible 4 global rythym festival.
although, 4 the most part his music is lyricless, ranging from the
super parodic odd couple cover swinging in trance 2 his more
mesmeric staples Q Dag recognizes the importance of being conscious
& active 4 change. DagUs most recent single: however, moves away
from the completely hypnotic & seems 2 offer a critique of american
culture & in being thought provoking, Dag also manages 2 keep the
vibe, & throw the beat Q itUs a subtle balancing maneuver that might
bring new consciousnesses 2 the bass cabinetsI i asked Dag what
makes an event happen, what gets people the energy? he said a good
sound systems has the power 2 overcome almost any crowd, & plunge
them into a pheel good phrenzy. even the perfect mix would have
trouble moving anyone if it was coming out of a realistic*.
secondly, the crowd has 2 B non-aggressive, & ^nally theyUre
shouldnUt B 2 many DJs. Dag feels DJs need @ least 2 hours 2 really
B able 2 relate 2 a crowd, & 2 work with a crowd 2 bring them
through different areas of dancing, trancing, tripping, feeling
happy. there R many emotions shared among the crowd Q the DJ has the
ability 2 relate these into a shared experience & constructed
narrative.

DJ Spun from San Jose

Spun works every style he can throw on the tables: from acid 2
tribal 2 laying out some miami bass & freestyle beats, Spun
considers DJ equipment an instrument through which he creates sound
collages. the idea of DJing as a creative process comes 2 Spun out
of his earlier days of strictly hip-hop spinning, & hip-hop gives
Spun a distinctive way of locking on 2 _ows between tracks based
deep in their percussion. he describes working w/ crowds as always
unique experiences: sometimes he enters the evening with a Sde^nite
tripS he wants 2 impose out musically, sometimes he tries 2 read the
crowdUs energy & take it further or just different places. thereUs
no magic formula 4 Spun. i had the chance 2 catch up w/ him last
week during deep space, a new weekly he headlines every thursday
night @ the san jose oasis, & if thereUs no magic formula. @ least
there is an almost magic ability 4 him 2 consistently relate 2 a
crowd, taking them around the worlds of powerfully distinct rhythms
while keeping his set a related whole moving from intense 2 tranced
2 tripped out in sync w/ the energy moods of the crowd. his
anticipation 4 when an audience wants 2 pick the pace back up, or
mellow out through a few mixes is uncanny. Spun feels house music
has changed many peopleUs lives 4 the more positive. just being able
2 lose it 2 some beat & work it as community w/ a dance _oor of
strangers is a good thing, & Spun is excited the scene is
continually growing, getting bigger while still getting better.
according 2 Spun, the music has de^nite ability 2 bring people
together because itUs completely apolitical Q no one has 2 get with
a certain opinion of the lyricist, they just have 2 let themselves
be moved by the thousands of watts of bass & an already present
vibe. itUs ironic that the least conscious of the scenes has done
more 2 bring people together on a consistent basis than any of the
overly-thought out programs of contrived togetherness.

Brian Behlendorf from SFraves

SFRaves, what is it? perhaps virtual community is an apt
descriptionI itUs an electronic mail network of about 250 people
communicating 24/7 about the bay areaUs emergent rave scene. the
conversations include everything from quantum physics 2 virtual
reality 2 the music, the djs, the people, the drugs, the love, some
more of the music, etcI 4 the people who participate, its become a
vital way 2 stay in touch & feel the warmth during the off hours
away from the dance _oor. 2 check it out , get access 2 internet &
ask 2 be a member by addressing a post 2
sfraves-request@soda.berkeley.edu. brian is the person who created
SFRaves, as well as being a prime helper in the creation of other
networks in the north-east, mid-west, south-east, u.k.,& southern
california. weUve had the chance 2 correspond over the net, & the
rest is a collection of thoughts about the uniqueness & conditions
of the bay areaUs scene: RWe are the tv generation.  we grew up with
technology.  we grew up without fearing it either.  We know the
H-bomb itself is not dangerous, it's the people who launch it who
are.  We know that without technology you just can't get that clean
bass sound, that super acidic "funky worm" sound et cetera.  The
presence of computers in creating a lot of the visuals at raves is
also significant - thanks to fractals and computer graphics. i think
ravers are beginning to see that computers are _not_ cold and rigid
and difficult to deal with, but instead tools we can use to expand
our mindsI [in terms of community] all I can say is, we've got to
watch out for each other, we've got to keep ourselves from doing
stupid things that can hurt our scene, to remember not to focus on
the money but focus on the party, and to keep acting like a family.
 If you see someone huddled in a corner with their head in their
hands, by all means walk over and say hi!  If you see someone
dancing for hours suddenly turn pale and weak, pull them off the
dance floor, get some water for them, and help them.  The scene is
starting to mature... our danger now is of getting to big for our
britches, getting too many people with dollar signs in their eyes.
Don't be lulled by the big parties and the big names - there's an
INCREDIBLE amount of DJ talent in the bay area.  Find the smaller
joints.  Go for the MUSIC and the PEOPLE. The drugs are extra.
Don't let them be your reason for going to parties.Keep it alive! I
[& about consciousness] it's hard to not be swayed towards certain
ideas, such as becoming more environmentally aware, having a greater
concern for your fellow humanbeings, etc., and of course, drug
legalization.  I remember Come/Unity on Nov. 6th, the night of the
election.  People were incredibly happy about George Bush being
kicked out of office".

the predominate currents in the Bay Area scene is 2 explain the @
often times very tangible positive energy of raving in metaphors of
mysticism from other cultures. words like RZenS. RshamanS, RtribalS
R dropped like beats in hasty attempts 2 clarify an unexplained
divergence from what amounts 2 a person's consistent norm. & rather
than doing the hard work of forging a language based on the
particulars of unique experiences, the effort walks the easy way of
already tread paths of conceptual imperialisms, of bringing in
culture w/o concern 4 context & respect 2 a hodge-podging, pick &
choosing of a media ready vocabulary of simulations. 1 reason the
west often looks 2 other cultures as symbols of deep thoughts on the
unexplained is because the west has had an impossible time
understanding otherness: the west reads its confusion in a mirror,
translating confusion as other cultural RmysticismsS. obviously,
raving is diverse, & @ best can multiply handle a plurality of
cultural in_uences Q thats probably a big reason why it continues 2
grow & people continue 2 stay. but i think 1 of the challenges
facing raving in the united states as anything more than just an
intense new trend in phun management is its ability 2 have phun
while learning that having phun is more than just being able 2 next

	o Procom or other communication software

Subject: Raving, They're Raving

Just rolled back in from Portland...was surprised at how far the town
has come musically since I left but was surprised at how lame the club
scene still is.

Went to a club (the Embers) a couple of times, once the DJ said 
"Time to RAVE!" and spun James Brown is Dead followed by Temple of 
Dreams followed by 'Borderline' by Madonna.  Gak.  Fired off many love
phaser volleys but all shields were up on full alcohol settings.  The
place was starting to seriously drain my Slack (tm) so I did the
appropriate thing (drank meself into oblivion).  Tired now, more
later.

-H-

P.S.  Fred:  Sorry we didn't hook up, our time was pretty limited.
BTW, since when did the Lotus (tm) crowd start going to the Embers?
They don't play Nine Inch Nails at the Embers :-)

P.P.S. Mike and Jon:  You  got big compliments for the UVC single from
the owner of Turntable Mary's.  Also, he seems to feel that
Twitch==God since he described you as 'the new Razormaid, but better'.

Subject: Brain Transplant

Hi everyone:

I saw an interesting show on NOVA last week called brain transplant.  It was
about these people who used a synthezised Heroin.  It turns out that it was
mixed badly and it ended up killing all the brain cells that create Dopemine. 
When this happened they could not move and exhibited symptoms of extreme
Parkinsons diseas.

The doctors treated them with a Parkinsons drug called El Dopo which helped
them move but the side effects were just as bad cause uncontrollable movement.

the show went on and shown how these addicts had fetus dopemene cells placed in
the brain and were partially cured. 

This show was very facinating and at the same time very scary to know what a
poorly syntheside drug (they used Botique Drug) could do.

I've generally stayed away from the Embers since it was pretty much just
the gay disco and show scene.  A pretty good place from what I've heard,
just not my stylee.  

There's a new year's thing in Portland being put on by the Blonde Indian
crew that's done previous r***-like events, but until they pull out of
the downtown club spaces I'm not all that interested.  Still may show
up in SF for NYE . . .

In other developments, the MTV host last night was Thurston Moore from
Sonic Youth, he spent a lot of time promoting the '1991: Year That Punk
Broke' flick that was roundly booed by all the Bay Area papers this month.
I'm a big Sonic Youth fan but wonder about all the fuss over a film
every review I've seen says is an excruciating waste of time.

BUT -- whoever is doing the selecting for 120M has made some real improvements
since Dave K. was booted.  Last night we got a cool Primal Scream 'Loaded' ->
The Orb 'Blue Room' (not a world premiere since I saw it on local cable a
month ago).  Also Dino jr., a cool new Inspirals, Black 47 doing 'Funky
Ceili' (hadda be there, I guess), the new REM (less boring than the first
one from the new record but still boring), and other neat stuff.  

Sorry about all this semi-non-rave stuff, we go for what excitement we
can get in the Great Wet North.

Yeah, it's overtly a gay disco/cabaret, but it's also the only decent
(non-sports-bar/etc) 21+ place to go dancing in P-town.  Or it was.  Tons of
heteros go there too.  More het than gay, in fact, judging by the
couples there.  Most of my gay friends up there go to the Brig.

If it's not in up front or some other pick-up bar it could be cool.
Manoj throws some killer parties.  It may not be a 'rave', though...
the last one I went to was a lot like a club (open bar, done at 4,
everyone drunk [[not unusual in Portland anyway]], etc...) but was
more fun than anything else going on...

Subject: Re: Something Important (i think)


    Well after four days without a fix i couldn't stand it any longer,
hijacked a car and drove till i found a terminal to plug into.  Ahhh,
i feel much better now.
    So i posted 4 days ago about the Institute that David Nichols is
planning to se 
t up (for the scientific study of psychedelics), and asked what you
all thought.  The response has been somewhat underwhelming.  i realize
the topic is a bit tangential to sfraves, but i also know a lot of you
are interested in such things.  And i feel more comfortable bringing it
up here first, among people i'm becoming familiar with, rather than, say,
alt.drugs, which i rarely frequent.
    As Dr. Nichols points out in a prospectus, at the Society of
Neuroscience meeting this year, out of over 10,000 reports, the word
"hallucinogen" occurs in the index only twice.  "This is a peculiar and
troubling reflection of current neuroscience research".  A well-funded
institute specifically founded for the investigation of psychedelics
and their effects on the human mind could turn this trend around.  i
truly believe that psychedelic compounds offer one of the best tools
to study human mind/consciousness (many of the great insights in 
biology, from Mendel to the present day, come from changing things
from the norm, observing the results, and trying to determine what those
results imply about both the normal and changed states -- why not
look at mind/consciousness the same way?).
    There's lots more to say about David Nichols plans -- who else is
involved, where the institute will be, when, funding and fundraising
(and he does hope to raise some funds from net.citizens).  But i'd
rather those interested hear it from him.  So let me know if you're 
interested, and i'll try to get him on the virtual rave at a specified
time, or icb, or some other net conferencing program, and you can grill
him and be grilled...  He doesn't have e-mail, but i expect that will
change soon.
    Oh, and once the prospectus is complete i'll probably post it
(though the damn thing is already pretty long).  But to end with another
quote from it -- "We are truly at square one.  It has been said that
there is no force in the universe more powerful than an idea whose time
has come.  Let us believe together that now is the time."

Subject: Re:  virtual rave?

It's been down because I took it down to add a feature, and when I tried to
put it up there are some "ghost connections", connections with say "CLOSING"
but have been "CLOSING" for three days now, and when I try to restart the
program the operating system (Ultrix, for anyone who might know something that
could help)it doesn't allow me to re-bind the program with port 7283 because
it says "It's already in use".  Anyone know how to close these connections?
"close 7283" doesn't work at the command line nor in C.  

So until the sysadmin comes back from break (or I figure out how to kick those
outside connections off) vrave is on 7282.  You're all welcome there :)

Ya, their history is passed through art too.  Some is deemed by
anthropol/archaeol ogists to tell of the last ice age.

I'm surpised this is the first you've heard of this.  I guess since you
work in the day you don't really see junior and high school age kids that
often but drive by your local high school at lunch time - it almost
looks like a rave in progress and it's been like that (realy prominent)
for about exactly a year (here in the east bay, anyway).

Do what you like.  The corporate/media wagon follows us, not the other way
around.  They don't spawn the ideas, they just exploit them, although,
I guess the results (exploitation) are the same. |-(  I personaly like the
styles that are out now.  At worse, they're no worse than the bell-bottoms
I wore up until 2nd grade and hey, there are still more people wearing
regular or tight jeans than baggies and those are styles too.  Face it,
your either gonna look like a Mervyn's add or a raver or whatever.  I've
never seen truly origional dress.  You'd really have to be creative to put
peices of material on your body in ways that no one has done before.

Ya, I saw part of this show too, I'll watch the whole thing when it repeats.

It's interesting because I remember seeing (about 5 years ago) a public TV
special about how this happened to these people and about trying to catch
the chemist that made the bad drugs.  If I remember correctly they found
out that all it was was that the synth-heroine-to-be cools down to fast at
one stage of the cooking process and makes some chemical with T's and P's in
it P2TP or something instead of this drug, which also has similar T's and P's
in it's chemical name (Howard, do you know?).  Anyway, you inject it thinking
your about to get high and get an instant Parkinson's-like disease.  Some of
these unlucky people are from San Jose, CA.

Just the other day, while fliping through news week, I saw an article about
this fetal brain cells injection technique and it featured one of the lady's
that took the bad drug that I had seen years before in the other show.  She's
also in this NOVA special.  I was surpised because I instantly recognized her
from the show and I'm usualy lame at recognizing unfamiliar people (even
popular actors in different roles - That's Isaac from the Love Boat!?  No
it's not, is it?).  Anyway, even though it's a partial cure it was pretty
amazing.  This lady is now self-sufficient (she wasn't before) and has a lot
more motor control than she had.  There was even a real Parkinson's patient
who could drive and perform other motor tasks that he hadn't been able to do 
in years.

There was a big discussion about this episode on alt.drugs about a
month ago.  I'm really sorry I missed it.  Evidently someone was
trying to synthesize an opiate analog (but not synthetic heroin, more

I have heard of alot of times when people have sold bad drugs but usually when
the drug is not a drug or it has something a little different in it.  I have
never heard of bad drugs being intentionally sold that does serious harm like
this stuff did. The people that do this are truly sick individuals, and it
saddens me to think that there are people like that out there.

The corporate/media wagon follows us, not the other way
around.  (by Mark)

i just kinda feel the loop isnUt quite so simple. i/m not really
sure if there is an us vs. them (i.e. ravers (trendsetters) vs.
corporate media wagoneers). i thinks its much more semipermeable
(sp?)
i/m not quite sure if anyone can really divorce themselves from
being part of everythings impending sellout because of the myriad
connections explotative structures have to everything else -
exploitation in the way fashion is made in large factories,
exploitation in major labels and their awful approaches to getting
their music played in addition to just the sleazy relationships
between cash management and sexism and hiring practices, etc...

anytime you use cash for product, i think you/re voting a vote of
confidence for the corporate media wagon

besides, i think some of the trendsetters are corporate images. i/m
trying to think of a corporate kool trend other than the modern
rock, essentially a corporate creation of trying to sell /punk/ and
creating a whole new substyle of schlock excitement.

and there/s the old stand by of corporate trendsetting - sandoz, the
cia, and lsd....

just thinking in the breeze, while being ultracool on my trendy mac,
plugged into the ether through the always corporate att&t and mci.

oh yeah, even if there is the distinction between people creating
the trend and people exploiting it, it seems to me the space trends
happen in are corporate, ui
                        i.e., i depend on mci to make this
conversation possible.

It's great when not only all the promoters start getting together, but
when the cops and promoters and ravers get along as well....Results =
Moby, Smart-E's, Prodigy all in the same month!  [and in a backwards
state, no less!]

Last night, even, there was an hour long show on our local
alternative music tv show called Teletunes dedicated to the rave scene
here in CO....It was hosted by Poor Boy Productions (the Colliseum
people), featured tons of videos, behind-the-scenes of putting
together the Moby rave, an interview with Moby, [he looks different in
daylight].....And another promoter, K-Nee of Step On Productions, has
his own hour long tv video show called Rhythm Visions, where he
regularly plugs his own raves....

[PS:  The Blue Room 3 minute music-video is great if you haven't seen
it, but I'm sure most of you have since you live in cultural centers]

And, aside from the emerging overground scene, the underground is
thriving here in Denver as well....At least about 10 promoters now, I
think...

This may not make much sense to our fellow ravers on Mars, Jupiter
and the other planets in our solar system, not to mention the ravers
throughout the rest of the universe whose different planetary orbits 
practically insure that they do not celebrate New Year's at the same 
time we do.  Nevertheless, I'm sure that our raver brethren on 
Alpha Centauri and elsewhere are quite happy to share in our joy and 
good spirit which is, after all, universal in nature.  The question 
still remains, however, whether the sending of good vibes is limited 
by the speed of light.

Religion and spirituality are two different things.  I don't think
I ever want raving to become a "religion", at least the way that I define
religion.  Besides, they can't really shut down raves at least not
forever.  The problem with religions is that they are generally hierarchical
and then the opression/repression/war/persecution cycle is entered into once 
again.  We need to try to break the pattern this time.

but on the more serious tip, i agree with geoff about the problems
of religion... but also spirituality aswell - not that i want to
step on anyone enjoying a spiritual component to raves, i just not
want to treat it as solely a spiritual engagement - i/m slowly
moving away from some of my eralier posts and thinking at least
right now i/m enjoying my ability to associate anything else with
raving but raving and the wonderful song of people enjoying the
experience for whatever reasons... alright, mostly whatever reasons.

i/d rather find the cornicopia of positive presences and poise them

(among other "theme" channels).  I'm still having trouble with port #7283

i.e. next week!) so for now it's at haas.berkeley.edu at port 7282.  To get

be clear.  As soon as 7283 becomes available again I'll move it there (gee,

I'd like to second this.  I'm going to be coming from Mountain View,
and having a rough idea of where I'm going to be heading would greatly
ease the logistics of work/cars/transportation/ad nauseum.

That, and I'd appreciate it if people would post to sfraves as soon as
they get through to get directions.  I'm not going to miss this thing
because of their phone ringing off the hook all night.

Finally, as mentioned before, I'm planning on leaving from Mountain
View at whatever time will get me there at 11ish.  I probably won't
want to go home until dawn or a bit later.  That said, happy to give
rides to anyone along the route from my place to the Gathering and
back (especially if they know of some cool chill places in the City if
things wind down too early at the Gathering).

Looking forward to meeting y'all, for reference, I'm 6' big blonde
guy, I'll be wearing a Cat-In-The-Hat hat, black tshirt, funky blue
and white shorts, middle longish hair or ponytail.

Rumor: ToonTown / SuperNova will be at Fashion Island (if it's the
same one I'm familiar with, it's a mall in San Mateo).

I ran into Malachy at El Rio Sunday nite and asked him.  All he would 
tell me is that it would be in the bay area, but not too far from
SF.  So I would guess that this means it is not gonna be in SF, but also
not in some godfersaken place like Santa Cruz. 

On another note; Malachy is trying to turn Sunday nites at the El Rio
into a weekly word-of-mouth rave happening.  He's especially targeting
the spring for this.  The El Rio has a really nice outdoor back yard
padio area in addition to a small but adequate indoor dance area.  Could
be nice.

58 in a sidebar entitled "IN BRIEF"

Raves: Manchester City Council attacked dance clubs which turn up heating,
forcing sweltering ravers to buy water at up to &2 ($3.20) a bottle. Five
people have dies in Greater Manchester of dance-floor dehydration since
1989.

(please pretend that the "&" three lines up is a British pound sign)

        Well, apart from the fact that this practice is unbelievably
irresponsible and greedy on the part of the promoters there, is there
anybody here who's heard more details about this?

I dunno. Remember that court case where American indians wanted to be
able to use Peyote legally -- it is a religious sacrement for some tribes.

Well, they lost....

Subject: Mass Media


Hi everyone, I'm back from a week in luscious Seattle and a-rarin' to go. 
While I was in Seattle I stopped by the X-Mass rave that someone had posted
about.  Two words:  big hair.  It had also been advertised on a radio station. 
I didn't bother going in.  At a cute little retro bar called Re-Bar not too far
away, I did run into two guys in Cat-in-the Hats.  Talked to them about the
rave scene for a bit.  Turns out one of them is the roommate of the guy who
promotes the best raves in Seattle (often involving Ryder trucks to deliver
people to secret locations) and apparently he wasn't doing anything that
weekend.

Coming home I sat on the airplane next to a couple guys from Norway who say the
scene there is dismal because it's impossible to get E and because the cops are
real tough on the parties after hearing about all the problems in Manchester a
few years ago.  Brian -- Expect a request from one of them to be added to the
list, since he has e-mail.

Now, on to the Mass Media.  The January 1993 issue of Details has a little
blurb about Scotto, 23, the promoter in New York who puts on the weekly NASA. 
They talked about his clothes and showed a couple of the DJs and their
fashions, too.  He said he donates 10% of his profits to Greenpeace.  He also
set up an 800 number for national rave info.  Call 1-800-4-RAVE-LINE.  I called
last night, and sure enough it's a recording of all the New Years raves
happening all over the country.  He also has a mailing list (paper mail) that
you can be added to.

Next, maybe this has been covered while I was gone, but there was an article in
the 23-DEC-92 Wall Street Journal (page B1) about the New Year's Rave at
Knott's Berry Farm, which, of course, Scotto mentions on his recording.  Here
it is:

	Knott's Berry Sets Holiday Jam
	But Maybe It Should Stick to Jelly

	By David J. Jefferson

	Every trend-setter knows that once something hits the mass market, it's
	no longer hip.  Take Peter Max.  Disco.  Junk bonds.

	So the avant-garde may have to give up "raves," huge, all-night dance
	parties.  Because on New Year's Eve, "K-Rave '93," a rave to end all
	raves, will be held at Knott's Berry Farm, the Buena Park, Calif.,
	theme park that jelly built.

	Heretofore, raves have been mostly underground affairs, often held
	illegally in abandoned warehouses and other remote locations, and
	attracting thousands of young people dressed in neo-hippie and
	faux-gang garb.  Rave revelers gyrate to lyricless computerized music
	called "techno," drop amino acid in the form of vitamin-enriched "smart
	drinks," and pop the occasional, illicit "ecstasy" tablet.  The
	atmosphere is equal parts '60s psychedelia and '90s urban street
	culter:  If rocker Grace Slick and rapper Marky Mark got their friends
	together, it would be a rave.

	That's not at all what you would expect to find at Knott's, which for
	years has shunned raucous New Year's revelry in favor of it's
	"Jubilation" evening of contemporary Christian music.  But the devout
	have been fewer in number, and Knott's needed a revenue-booster.

	The Knott family was uncomfortable with the idea of letting teenagers
	dressed like the Mad Hatter and go-go dancers invade the park, but Dan
	Anderson, the 22-year-old great-grandson of founder Walter Knott and a
	raver himself, convinced them that it could hold a rave sans the
	seedier elements.  "You don't have to worry about dirty lyrics," says
	Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville.

	Won't a Knott's Berry Farm rave be like a Muzak rendition of "Like A
	Virgin?"  Knott's doesn't think so.  In keeping with the latter-day
	Renaissance Faire flavor of other raves, Knott's will populate the park
	with bizarre street performers:  a snake charmer, tribal dancers,
	athletes on Stairmaster machines (?!), Vegas-style show girls riding
	Snoopy floats (??!!).  "We're juxtaposing elements in a surrealistic
	way," says Jeff Langley, a one-time collaborator with feminist flof
	singer Holly Near and now Knott's directory of entertainment.  He's
	hoping that "hokey becomes hip."

	The hip crowd may show up simply to poke fun.  But Knott's will have
	the last laugh:  Each raver will have paid $27.50 to attend.

There you have it.  The contry's venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have
just received their first insight into the country's latest exploitable fad.

Share and enjoy,

Tim

P.S.  Sorry if someone already posted any of this, but I was off the list
for a week.

Subject: rave as religion


Regarding the idea to form a religion to legitimize raving (& sacred
substance):

there are 2 examples of this that i have experienced: the Native American
Church (which Niels mentioned) and the League for Spiritual Discovery.  The
Native American Church is composed of members from many native nations, with
Peyote as a sacrement.  Despite the passage of the Native American Religious
Freedom Act in the late seventies, the Reagan/Bush juggernaut, through a
hard-to-legally-fathom decision, disallowed the right of native voyagers to
t{e use of their sacrament...forgetting about underage Catholic blood-of-
christ drinkers.  See the new video Peyote Road (Kifaru Prodctions:
415/673-5004 to order)

In the mid-sixties, Leary tried to force legalization of sacramental use of
LSD by modelling some of the League for Spiritual Discovery activities after
the Native Church.  At the same time, in the same glorious location, Art
Kleps founded the Neo-American Church, a brilliant parody of the serious
ness which had descended upon Millbrook's attempts to turn on the world.
The Neo-Am Church established local priests, or rather, Boo-Hoos, around the
world with the power to administer sacraments.  The Law didn't see it that
way.

Leary wrote a brilliant & beautiful pamphlet called "Start Your Own
Religion" which established the model for setting yourself up as a religion
of you & your friends, claiming that possession & use of sacramental
substances was your divine right.  The Law didn't see it that way.

If there are enuf ravers who establish a serious sacramental practice of
dancing & neurological joy, in local enclaves, with regular "masses," and
can also establish the millenia-long connection to traditional shamanic use
of sacramental substances, why not try to re-establish your religious-

*RIGHT TO ALTER YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS*

Peace, Joy, and Welcome to the Re-Emergence of the Light,
Alpha-10

Um, I have to say that there's enough drug-war propaganda to squash any
information that might change the laws.

We're not at the law changing stage yet.  We are, however, at the

I love the scene but I sure don't understand the priorities of
ravers.  Despite the examples of Sufism/dervishes and the Native
American Church, you're chances of getting legal recognition of
raving as a religion are nil, and even if you did your chances of
getting X declared a legal sacrament are nil^2.  This past year the
Supremes severely limited the practice of religion exception for
sacramental peyote, pretty much gutting that legal precedent as an
applicable exception.

Meanwhile, the rave community ignores narrow, practical steps that
would vastly improve the legal status of the rave movement.  There
was that guy working for one of the liberal SF supervisors who
wanted to push for reforming SF city laws.  He said he got no
response from sfravers for his request for help.  Jeesh.

Subject: Making a better 1993

As 1992 draws to a close, I want to thank all of my rave family for a really
great time in the past few months.  You are a truly exceptional group of
people!  A friend of mine forwarded me a copy of Harvey Fierstein's
commencement speech at Bennington last spring, and I thought that his
12-step program was a good set of wishes for the New Year.  So here they
are:
Harvey Fierstein's 12-Step program:



1.   Never lie, and never let anyone cause you to lie.  Truth, or the
pursuit of it, is all we have.



2.   Never do anything you are ashamed of.  If you're ashamed, that means
somewhere inside you think it's wrong; and if you think it's wrong, you
shouldn't be doing it.



3.   Take full responsibility for yourself.  You are the only one who can
say what goes into or comes out of your body.



4.   Always admit when you're wrong.  You'll save thousands in therapy later
-- and a few friendships too.



5.   Change your mind as often as possible.  Just because you thought
something yesterday doesn't mean you have to think it today.  Don't ever
become a prisoner of your own opinion.



6.   Beware of anyone who says they know.   Trust me, they don't, or they
wouldn't have to say they did.



7.   Take care of yourself first, then your family, then your friends.  And
if you have anything left over, share it.



8.   Do something, anything, every day to change the world.  It doesn't have
cking up litter.  Anything will change the world.



9.   When you have nothing better to do, smile.  You'll have to trust me on
the miracle this step brings.



10.  Make a bit of time every day to be pogh.  It will keep you sane.



11.  Have all the sex you want -- safe sex.  Get lust out of your way.  It's
the only way I know to make sure you fall in love for the right reasons.
And I want you all to find true love.



12.  Learn something new every day.  Read a newspaper article that you
wouldn't normally read.  Open a dictionary to a word you never heard, or
never understood.

See you at Basics tonight.

Yo, all.  Not sure how many of you will see this, but what the hell...

I'm leaving from Mountain View probably at 9 PM to head to the
Gathering.  I'm planning on staying until the bitter end, and then
heading over to the DNA lounge for an event they have starting at 6 AM
($3)... Hard to guess when I'll be heading home, I'll probably be
pretty burned out by noon or so.

More than happy to give a ride to anyone who isn't too far off any of
the beaten paths... I could cut up through the City and use 80, or use
880, or use 680.

Given my plan of ending up at DNA, people living near BART might find
this offer especially appealing... or I can drop you off at your place
on the way to DNA or on the way home (depending on where I pick U up,
natch).

I'm bailing from work soon, my number in Mountain View is (415)
988-8625, number here is (415) 506-2784...

See you all there!  I'll be wearing a Cat-In-The-Hat hat, ponytail,
black tshirt, blue and white semi-funky shorts, I'm 6', blonde hair,
blue eyes.  Come say hi!

Has anyone ever given thought to organizing a rave that would center on 
spirituality/shamanism and therefore be able to determine/analyze if this 
concept/idea would be worth pursuing legally, and if not legally at least 
conciously by ravers/ravettes. Focal points could be positive vibes, 
dancing to the point of spiritual/human ecstasy or transcendence and on a 
personal note including conga drumming as a vehicle to properly extract the 
tribal or future primitive emotions or conciousness necessary to 
transfigure us to this elevated state of being. I would appreciate your 
comments as this has already been a source of interest and discussion by 
myself and other conga drummers who get together to drum and become one 
with nature. Also are there any other conga drummers out there who would be 
interested in forming some type of meeting along these lines?

Happy New Years to all !!!

just got back from a trip to ny. thanks to laura@usl.com, i was able to
find out what's going on in and around ny. so here's the travelogue:
first i tried to go x-mas eve, only to find THREE clubs i called closed.
that was kinda surprising. so anyway, next day i went to this place, peace
on thompson, bet. bleecker and houston, at 185 i think. it was $12, not too
ad for ny, i guess. the theme according to the description i got was acid house
i thought it was quite good, some old house, some raggamafin stylee. the energy
was pretty high, but it i did not get much of a sense of community, of that
collective feel. i stayed until 4:30 when the music stopped. there were too
many pairs and not enough circles of dancers.
then on sat. i went with to revelation. this was more of a traditional rave, in
a werehouse in brklyn. 1 st i got the directions from this store on christopher
st., DECADENCE, near bleecker. then, on the b, then the r to 25th st. stop.
the place was quite big. there were a LOT of friendly people, dancing, hanging
out. there were two room, a smaller one as i got in which had slower, 'trancy'
music. the 2nd, bigger room had very fast tekno ( approx. 160 bpm, i'd guess)
it did not appeal to me, plus there were some teknical problems for a bit.
but the mix was non-existent. i enjoted the 1st room better, plus  the dj
there was building up an 'arch', with slow stuff, then gradually putting faster
music, slowly changing the tempo. kool.
finally on tue. i got to check out the LIMELIGHT, the club in a church.
it was really packed. there was some band playing at 2 am when i got there,
but then the dj started playing tekno/industrial stuff - it was t/i night.
the energy in the crowd was really good and by sheer neccesity people were
dancing in groups. i met couple of people - hi james, if u use this net -
and the general feel was very friendly, definitely unusual in ny . the mixing
was quite good and the msic kept me moving  .
i would definitely agree the sexual energy in ny is higher than in the bay
area. could not get a good sense of waht percentage of people where using
chemical stimulants, tho' the warehouse rave had the largest number.
it seems like a stimulating place .
take care/shalom/salaam/keep the vibe strong

So who is the Bay Area's youngest female DJ?  I know DJ Mind Machine (Carresse
P-Orridge, Genesis's daughter) is 10 or so.

And in case I forget, I have my drivers license in my wallet.

Subject: Phone Fraud !


Hello SFRavers!

 Well, before all the New Year's Eve posts come pouring in, I thought I
should keep soda.berkeley busy by posting my recent encounter with 
phone fraud. 

 [ No rave content below : Some pertinence to email ]

 Some of you might remember seeing my recent posting to Charles Pooley. I
couldn't remember who the guy was, but his name was somehow associated 
with email in my mind, so that's why I posted to SFRAVES to try to contact
him.

 It turns out that someone was trying to use his name to get me to 
divulge my calling card number! The episode went as follows:

 At about 6PM thursday evening, I got a phone call. The operator said that 
he had a collect call to me from Charles Pooley in New York. The name was
familiar, but I didn't remember exactly why. I said I would accept the call,
but then the "operator" said the call couldn't get through because I had
the call collect option blocked. He then said he could pass the call
through if I gave him my calling card number. I said that I'd rather call 
Mr. Pooley myself, and could the "operator" give me Mr. Pooley's number.
There was a pause, then a phone number with a San Jose area code! It didn't
occur to me until later that , if the call was from New York, why was
the call-from number (408)!??!

 After I posted my SFRaves message, I remembered that Charles & I had been
corresponding on a topic from sci.electronics, not sfraves. I was lucky
enough to have an old message from him lying around, and emailed him
a message about my mysterious phone call. 

 Charles Pooley replyed to me today - turns out the guy tried the same scam
on him too! But this time, the bogus operator said the collect call was
from me to Charles! Charles was also wary, and didn't give the crook his
calling card number.

 So - WATCH OUT! How this con artist chose my name & Charles' to try is 
beyond me. As far as public postings in sci.electronics, I don't think
Charles and I had exchanged more than four public postings. Most of
our correspondence has been via "private" email. 

 This has definitely raised my paranoia level. If, out of the millions of 
public postings during 1992, someone should choose two correspondents
who have exchange only a slight amount of messages.... I mean , why us?
Or, is there a "boilerroom" operation going on, with a bunch of phony
operators, armed with USENET listings - calling people with this con?

 OH! - I may have put my phone number in one of my public sci.electronics
postings - that's probably how the scamsters make their selection. Makes
sense...

 				CHILDREN BEWARE!!!
