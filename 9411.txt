Maybe this is a lesson we can learn without someone getting killed.
One thing to start thinking about is site safety. If the way in is
obscured (or treacherous in natural ways), we need to be thinking
about what we can do about it.

So let's say you've got an awesome site, but the way in is a perfect
place to mug someone. What would you do about it?

How weird to read about (1) a rave mass (2) a *hot* party (damn! I wish
I couldva gone to F&F! bryce & ethan (and everyone..) you got it goin'  
on! things sure have changed from last year, huh? right on!) and        
(3) violence at sunset, 24th & illinois.  What contrasts!

Watch my attempt to stitch it all together with Mark Ameba's thoughts on
Tribal Future:  the tribal future is now.  like it or not, the tribes 
are here.  the funky techno tribe, the friends & family tribe, the raver
tribe all together, and that gangsta tribe, too.  They are the tribe
that likes to "fuck shit up."  They are the ones who see other people
doing stuff and then fuck it up.  Sounds to me like they consider the 
spot where sunset was "their" territory.  I thought gang's were into
protecting their turf, or whatever, but what I know about gangs comes from
watching west side story on tv...so, you can fill me in for real if you
want!

The Tribal Future party up at Russian river was a great rave...every   
notice how the best ones really match up with their name?  'cause at that
party, there were people from every little raver sub-tribe there, it seemed
to me!  I guess it's 'cause the amebas connect with everybody, one way or
another, that likes to rave.  For that reason, it was a right on party.

Friend's and Family has a sfraves tribe feeling to it that i like a lot.
I met three really neat people at F&F III that turned out to be neighbors
here in suspiciously quiet El Cerrito.. Again, an example of how a party
when it's good gives you what you expect it to.  Because you expect it
to! 

I hope the Pacific tribe is doing okay this week after such a scary 
episode sunday.  stay strong!

I really enjoyed F&F4, but once again ran out of gas due to a very hectic
work schedule, so I left at about 4:30 right as Sean was getting into the
groove.  

I liked the rearranged setup in the hallway and thought that worked much
better for the DJs.  The main room was quite hot again but not unbearable
at least for stretches!  I stayed in for most of Ethan's set and the one
following before bailing out.  

The visuals were great and I really liked that set of slides to the effect
of, "We do this because we LIKE it!"  Damn straight.

Laura played disco and HOUSE (!) amongst other things and Alex played my
favorite Plink Plonk track and by golly it was a real good time and I'm
glad I could make it!

Have to make this shorter than I'd like, since I'm here late finishing the work
I was supposed to be doing Sunday afternoon instead of sleeping after F&FIV |->.
Just wanted to add my vote for this being the best party I've ever been to, and
that includes the '91 LA Phoenix Society party w/the hand-held flame throwers and
mushroom tea booth, and the Albuquerque party under the perfect desert sky.

I got a chance to talk that morning with Bryce, Ethan, and the man who did the
video (sorry I can't remember your name!) after the teardown. Was _really_
impressed with and inspired by your commitment to the people, the music, and the
scene. Thanks to all who helped put this on! You've got my help and support in
the future in whatever way I can give it!

Thanks also to my new friend Don for showing me how to have fun in SF!

Hmmm,

As I remember it, "Theme from S'Express" is *the* house music anthem... not
that it matters.

Just my $0.02...

HI ALL,

I am sorry I missed F&F-4, but I had too much work to finish before I leave
for Chicago. I'm going to be a speaker at a national education conference
there.

This is going to be my first venture outside of the "friendly confines" of
the San Francisco rave scene. For those that know me, and I am now a
forty-something raver, who has fallen prey to  this music, and all the
friends I've made. Special thanks to Ethan, Bryce, Laura, Tomatsu, Lane, Lee
and Janie,Geoff, Rick Preston,Tony, The Cloud Factory, Kenneth Paul, Forrest,
Loren, Mark, G-N-C, and many,many, more who have provided me with so much of
yourselves to take with me.


"Now, armed with your good cheer and affections," I go forth to 
find the House music undeground in  Chicago.  I am loaded down with copies of
SF tapes to trade, Info line numbers,  phone numbers of former SFravers in
Chicago, and a copy of REACTOR magazine.

I am on the lookout for Dj's Derrick Carter, Mystic Bill, Lil' John, Orlando,
and Freddie Bain. I will also be hanging round Gramaphone records in a
trenchcoat, flashing copies of my tapes saying, "wanna trade?"

But, what I really want to find out is if House music creates in Chicago the
same kind of Vibe we have here in SF. My already opinion is that we have the
greatest raves here, the greatest music, and the greatest people.  But, won't
it be fun to find out.
I hope to provide some interesting posts from my odyssey into the Chicago
underground.

Who's bitter?  It's called opening your eyes and ears and mind to what's
going on around you, not getting high and thinking happy thoughts.

Violence *is* a normal part of our society, like it or not.  You don't
have to accept it, but you do have to accept that it is there, and you
can do something about it.  Making excuses that widen the social gap is
probably not the way to help solve things.

Well then I guess it's a good year for normal violence cause its on the rise. 
Violent crimes rose 5.6 percent five times faster than the rate of overall 
crime. According to the annual National Crime survey. There were 10.9 million 
violent crimes last year now that's something to remain sober for.

Yes, this is another "rave" about Friends and Family IV. I have been to 
all of them, but I think this is the best one yet, and hopefully more to 
come. The music was awesome, the people were awesome. Thanks to all the 
DJs and Bryce and Ethan. The visuals were also great. Thank god that 
Bryce brought those water bottles. I forgot to go get some at CostCo:).
It was also great meeting new people and seeing some familar faces as 
well. Hopefully I will see you all again soon.

Well then I guess it's a good year for normal violence cause its on the rise. 
Violent crimes rose 5.6 percent five times faster than the rate of overall 
crime. According to the annual National Crime survey. There were 10.9 million 
violent crimes last year now that's something to remain sober for. (-X

Who's bitter?  It's called opening your eyes and ears and mind to what's
going on around you, not getting high and thinking happy thoughts.

Violence *is* a normal part of our society, like it or not.  You don't
have to accept it, but you do have to accept that it is there, and you
can do something about it.  Making excuses that widen the social gap is
probably not the way to help solve things.

An article about the rave mass appeared in the SF Examiner over the weekend,
and it did not have the quote from the guy who complained about not being able
to get drugs.  I found nothing wrong with the article.

So not all of the press about the rave mass was bad.

The article was in Monday's SF Comical.  Luckily, the quote was at the 
very end of the article.  Apparently "Strick"  Strickland sent SFraves his 
side of the story-did it get bounced?  I'll try to find out before I 
go into this any more.  Overall the article wasn't too 
bad, but much of the first part is spent blathering about deadheads for 
some reason.

Yet another raving weekend
--------------------------


Ok,  all you ravers...  Time for yet again,  another wakey report... :-)
Thanx for all the complements on my previous reporting,  glad you enjoy them.  

For the first time in a long time,  I didn't actually go out and party
on Fri evening.    Instead,  I stayed home and got cought up on a lot
of trivial tasks that accumulated to the point where it would take an
entire evening to do them all.

Normally,  I reserve my Friday evenings for private parties,  unless there
is a killer rave happening...

This weekend,   I was NOT going to miss Friends and Family no matter *what*,
so thats where I was.    WOW!!  What a GREAT party....   I'm still tabulating
all the new SFRavers I met... Hi Todd...  Purple Tiger,  and Don!!

I got there very early...  Brought two friends from the local Mill Valley
area (For one,  it was his first rave).    I was amazed at how fast it grew
to more than 60 people...   Havce no idea how meny were there,   but the
energy was insane....   Dipite having more than 3 fans,   it was sweltering
very early on....   I done know what that was who was spinning that hard
techno,   but whoever that was,   thanx for a fine set!!

Happening at the same time,  was Funkey Techno Tribe...   Although I never
went (Due to it's steep $25 admittance fee),  I got reports that it was
pretty good,   but not everyone could get in.

Thats Ok....  F&F was every thing I expected it to be....   Smallish,   High
enegy,   and exceptional DJ's.    I also got to hear Sean Spin,   Yey!!   I
danced to MOST of his stuff...   But had to leave and go to the hot room when
I started to hear that really fast stuff.   The heat didn't allow me to stay
in there long enough for a good set,   so I went back to hear the rest of Sean's
set.    By the time San finished his set,  it was already 6 am...  sheesh!
how time flies when you are having phun!!   The front room closed down,   and
I migrated back to the hot room....   Things were still hopping,   but the 
crowd size diminished significantly.   Still very high energy right up until
the end.    About 7:00 or so.

I headed home ro chill,  take a hot shower,  and get the gunk off of myself
from that hit steamy place.

At around 2 pm,  called the Sunset info number,  and learned it was going
to be just south of Funston.    Yukk!!  I thought to  myself that it was
certainly going to get busted from using that spot,  as I recalled it
was also used last year.

Just as I got there,    people were leaving,  telling me that it got moved,
so we headed over to the new spot.    Without revealing secrets,   it was
held in Potrero district,   out on a small jetty in the bay.     VERY ISOLATED
and I couldn't even hear the music until I got to within 300 meters.   The
sound van was blocking MOST of the sound in the direction towards the houses
which were more than a mile away.

When I got there,  there were about 60 people,   but it started to fill
rather quickly to about 300 people.    Really GOOD VIBE,  great location,
but with ONE bad thing that happened.    I only got this from word of mouth,
but it was reported that some gang member hit someone over the head with a 
gun,  and mugging them.     Word wuickly got out,  that if one were to leave,
they should do it in large groups.    This took place sometime around 8:30 or
9 pm.    Some people called the police,   but I didn't see any police at the
rave site.    The music finally stopped at about 10 pm,   but this would have
gone on longer if that other bad incident hadn't happened.

So,  there you have it...    But next week,   I will have to devote my entire
weekend at a nerd conference up at lake Tahoe... Ohmygawd!! a WHOLE WEEKEND
without dancing??

Back again... Later...

Subject: Self Defense For Ravers - Part 1
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Recent attacks on ravers from PLUR-challenged elements of our society
has left many of us feeling frightened and helpless.  When hugs and
smiles fail to disarm antagonism from the vibe-impaired, ravers only 
need to be aware of the powerful arsenal already at their disposal.

Self Defense Tips For Ravers - Part 1 - RAVER WEAPONRY

Bean Bag Chairs - can be used as an assault weapon.  Toss at approaching 
assailant to confuse or temporarily disable.  Can be used to absorb blows.
Will deflect bullets if filled with pennies or lead weights.

Plow pops - sharpen the stick end.  When threatened, slowly remove
blowpop from mouth, then thrust stick end forward into assailant's stomach
or groin area.

Vinyl Records - With some practice, you can learn to toss records
frisbee style at assailant's neck area for beheading purposes.  Do 
not practice near friends.

Whistles - Can be used to startle and infict hearing pain to oncoming 
assailants.  Note: Although whistles are sometimes used as a distress 
signalling device, most of your fellow ravers will flee from the sound 
of them rahter than come to your aid.

Flyers -   Stacks of smaller ones can be thrown in the face of an assailant
to blind them.  The large commercial ones can be used to inflict a serious
paparcut.

Water Bottles - these too make good throwing weapons; even better if 
filled.

Blinking lights - wave slowly in front of assailant to hypnotise them.
If that fails, throw.

Speaker cabinets - 2 or more ravers needed to lift and throw.  Get 
permission from owner of sound system first.

Sound System - recent experiments have demonstrated that certain sound
frequencies can be tuned to resonate and rupture internal organs.  DJs
should always carry a few records with such sounds at renegade parties.
Do not mix these up with normal record collection.  Aim speakers at
antagonists, play at normal volume.

special party. It wouldn't have been what it was without the myriad
contributions of *everyone* that came and participated. I'm glad it was as
rewarding to all of you as it was to me. Lets do it again soon!

lots of love
ethan

Whoa,

We left Sunset at around 6:30 or 7:00 and I felt wierd vibes and had some
thoughts about how there could be some danger out there. This was after I
split off from my friends whom I had walked with and had to walk a little
ways down to where I had parked. I did see some people hanging out in a
truck that didn't really look like ravers there. I just picked up my pace
got to my car, jumped in and locked the door and took off. When I heard
where the party had moved to earlier in the day. My first thought was of
the Candlestick party and I thought "Oh no, not out there". But after I
drove to the sight, I thought it might be OK because it seemed pretty far
removed from any neighborhood and the speakers were facing out towards the
water.
I had a great time for the time that I was there. Galen and Tony played
some great stuff. 
My heart goes out to those traumatized and injured.

STARDATE 3427894579889573.0000:

Well, folks and folkesses (folkaroonies), there was an awesome party last 
night at the Blue Lagoon/Cafe Casanova last night, though it had to end 
at 2am for whatever reason clubs have to end.  Anyway, these two 
establishments are right next door to each other, and the Lagoon side was 
21+ and the Casanova side was 18+.  Both rooms were phun, but Spun was in 
the mysterious Lagoon side (I say mysterious, because the dj room is the 
kind you can't see in to, so it was tough to get a glimpse, but I saw a 
shillouhette of ol' Spun there, hard at work spinning some funky but 
tribal but housey halloween music.  I was really getting into the groove 
and wanted to find some percussion.  I found a plastic ashtray and a 
lighter and got the rythm going.  That was fun, but the lighter didn't 
make enough noise, so instead I went next door after Spun cooled his jets 
a bit and went to the 18+ side.  This to me was just like a Santa Cruz 
rave, because I saw all the people (most) that were at Harmony and other 
parties I have been to over the summer (though not many in Santa Cruz :/ 
).  Anyway, there was a tribal drummist there with a HUGE conga drum and 
that brought the vibe up and created smiling faces all over.  SWEATBOX, 
though, hopefully the casanova people will be able to get a fan in there 
if ever there is another rave there (I hope so, that is a nice space).  

so anyway, that is the report here from Santa CRuz, and other than 
swelling waves and a closed Cafe Odeon :( , things are pretty marvelous 
here.  

love for all and all for love,

Just some words I want to spew:

ins outs candy dandies vibrant visuals soft hair free waaaaterrrr colorful
toys steamy hot'n'sweatty floors funky costumes sassy sportsbras friendly
folks stellar music ups and ups and ups and then a big CHEEEEER! big fans
red random laser a school of fish happy I mean really happy people and Dr. 
Whoo-wooo, HEY... drwho... 

It doesn't make much sense but for some reason that's how I remember it.  

I got there around 11pm and began dancing immediately!  later in the
evening it was so packed, I found myself squished next to the stairs but
conveniently close to the BIG FAN. I didn't think I could make it with all
the heat and the thick techno beats calling to me, being still sore from
the Cap'n'Crunch mondo workout a few days prior, but heck the energy kept
me going.  Afterwards, no more sore!  Crunch has really got a good
exercise system going because I feel great and I don't even know why! 

A great party.  Good stuff.  Major Danke.

o.O

Two things.

The number of teenagers murdered with guns goes up but the number murdered
with knives goes down and the overall rate goes up.  Guns is bad.  If that
insane level of empowerment weren't there things would be different.

As much of a negative affect those who either failed in society or were
failed by it had on us you gotta hope, that at some low level they couldn't
reject, we affected them back in a positive way.  Who else but brave social
workers and teahcers would try to bring peace and love and all that to HP?
Some looney ravers I guess.  Its a high price to pay to maybe have an affect
on someone.  And its really sad if these folks are so damaged that we can't
relate or connect in some way.  
Maybe if they had gone to a rave when they were younger and seen that there
are people out there that love you...

[ this is my fourth attempt in two days to post to the list.
  i hope my From: is correct this time?
  i'm beginning to get paranoid....

Apparently my reply did not get reflected to everyone yesterday by the
hyperreal server, but the direct address to Brian McGonigle did work,
and we've exchanged mail about our common disappointment with the story
and we've made up, so the rest of you can now catch up.  Brian wrote me:

I quit reading mail yesterday after my reply because I've got some
serious writing that has to be done *soon*, and you can't think about
you're writing when you're getting more and more upset about something.

Here again is my reply if you didn't get it yesterday.
I apologize again for the trouble, and I'm sorry if I haven't answered
your mail, it may be another day before I can write personal replies;
I have to quit reading mail again.

| # " The look is 'rave', but this feels like a different community,"

ass on the Internet.
| # "These people are not ravers," he said. "No one here offered me any drugs."

|
| Yeah, I'm here.  I'm not a PR type.  I chatted with this guy after the
| Mass for like 10 minutes, about a *lot* of stuff, and it looks like I
| made a grand faux pas.
|
| (*defensiveness on*)
| He chose what to print in the paper; he picked that spin.  I'll admit
| the quote is accurate.  There's nothing I can do about that now, except
| just don't talk to people.  I had no idea it was such a media event
| until it was all over, when reporters came out of the woodworks,
| I was in a really happy mood by then, and wasn't thinking antagonistically
| at all.  But if a drug comment was what he was looking for, he could have
| fished people until he found it.  It's his story to spin.
| (*defensiveness off*)
|
|
|
| But let me ask you (assuming you were at the Mass):
|
| If you were asked "Was it a rave?" how would you answer?
|
|
|
| No, to me it wasn't a rave, it was a Mass -- liturgy, eucharist,
| absolution, the whole bit -- a very beautiful, very powerful Mass.
| Afterwards at F&F4 I realized I was right:  F&F was a rave, not a Mass.
| F&F was also very beautiful, very powerful, but it was quite different.
| (How would you describe the differences?)
|
| Yet, as I told the reporter, I think there are a lot of things in common,
| besides just the music:  an attitude of hope, an embracing of change,
| symbols of light, of recapturing technology for good purposes, an
| emphasis on building community.  But that's not what he printed.
|
| Then I made the joke as an afterthought.  It was a mistake; I'm sorry.
| I live and I learn...
|
|     -- strick
|
|
| p.s.  I'll say that otherwise I thought the article was quite good.
|       Thanks to Mr Lattin for getting us on the front page,
|       and for the excellent picture, which captured pretty well
|       the feeling of the space...  It's too bad that drugs have
|       to be such a issue for people.
|
|
|
|

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Anyone who still thinks that I went to the Mass looking for drugs, and
complained afterwards about not scoring, can turn on their television
set and believe what ever they see there next.  Jesus, get a clue about
the news media!  Get a clue from Negativland -- check your facts!  The
story said I'm on the net.  I'm here on the list.  I'm served by the NIC:
"whois strick".


Hugs to everyone at the mass and everyone at F&F, it was truly awesome,
it's carried me through all this shit.

The original mission statement dates back to about 1985, and reads as follows:


BECAUSE WE CELEBRATE LIFE AND BATTLE
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SATISFIED
BECAUSE IT IS UP TO US
BECAUSE WE LOVE TO SING AND DANCE
BECAUSE THE PRESSURE IS UPON US
BECAUSE THERE ARE GOVERNMENTS AND BORDERS AND COPS AND COURTS
BECAUSE THE BOUNDARIES MUST BE BROKEN
BECAUSE WE ARE OUT OF CONTROL
BECAUSE THEY SAID WE COULDN'T DO IT
BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE IT


I, too, was psyched to see the words translated into the house party vibe
and projected over a sea of hot moist bouncing souls. Michael tweaked the
verses a bit and took the concept in a whole new direction! Thanks, Mike!

F&F was really cool.  All I can remember with any clarity is Laura's set.
So, okay it was really kooky, but I'm kooky too and so I was in heaven.
I have a soft spot for Abba and "Dancing Queen" is one of my favorite
ABBA tunes for all the obvious reasons.  Everything after that became a
sweaty blur as I lost my mind to the music.  Who needs drugs to escape
when i've got F&F.

I met so many SF Ravers at F&F.  Wow!  It was so cool to attach faces
to names and such.  What a cool group of folks we all are!

I hung out at F&F till the end.  I think I wanted to leave sooner but
there were people sleepin on my purple bean bag.  What's a tiger to
do?  I ended up napping up on the loft for 30 mins and woke up to dance
for the last half hour.  Came home and wrote about rabbits.

Woke up three hours later to go to Sunset.  I chatted with the DJ from
the west indies (Starfire?) and I think I'll go see him spin on Friday.
I must have left sunset just before things went sour.  I think the only
reason my friends and I weren't the victims was the police car that
drove down to the end of the spit and back.  I almost wish it was me,
I would have gladly given them my plastic sword and the few bucks I
had.  I don't know if they would have wanted the bean bag.

Monday I went to the Castro.  Got there early around 9 so I could see
some clothes before the mobs got there.  I wore my favorite black dress but
I knew i couldn't compete with the pros.  Who wants to anyway?  Yeah, sure,
I could cover myself with prismatic mirrors and 5 inch heels, but is it
comfortable?    Met some ravers there like Ron Nikels, Kathryn, Bryce and
Jason.  Bryce and Jason trod a path through the trongs to the Castro
Theatre and my friend and I followed close behind.  On the way through the
crowd someone pulled my hair to see if it was real, EXCUSE ME?  In general,
as the night went on things got more and more wierd.  At one point I felt
like I was a tame TV in a petting zoo.  Got to be to much so at 11 I left.

I had a profound exchange with Jason (let me paraphrase):

Jason: "No matter where I stand people tend to bump into me more than you."
Me:    "Gee, that doesn't sound very pronoid" ( I was being a smart ass)
Jason: "Oh, I don't know, I didn't say I didn't like it."

And that my friends is very, very deep.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

	Not only does a gun empower its holder, it seems to bring out the
side that is willing to play with that power. There are places which have 
a vibe around the Bay area that is more than just menacing, a kinda cloud 
of uneasiness that descends when the sun goes down. I am not really sure 
how to describe it, and I didn't really even notice it til I was in 
Scotland (because it wasn't there). To walk through the streets of 
Edinburgh on the way back from a weekily event at 4 am generated nothing 
more than conversation, but such a walk here at times brings out my 
defensive instincts.
	The security of knowing that if a situtation gets out of control 
to the point where someone is willing (or wanting to) physically harm, 
that that harm can only come from with a certain distance seems to remove 
this uneasiness. If someone comes after you with a knife or chain or bat 
or fist, they have to want to hurt you bad enough to chase you, bad 
enough to get in close enough to see what they are doing, close enough to 
be hurt as well. A gun eliminates something from this list from the 
aggressor while giving the one at which these aggressions are aimed a 
hell of a lot more to deal with. Whether it be that a stab wound does not 
sit on the mind in the same way as the thought of a slug leaving a 6+ 
inch hole in the back of one's skull, or something else, a gun changes a 
situation. This change is something I do not know how to deal with... I 
must say, it was nice to be able to walk through the streets. I do not 
know what I am really trying to say, probably just expressing my opinion 
that the rtemoval of guns frm society would be nice (including the cops), 
ahhh the stuff dreams are made of

 And I've been in Rome, Paris, Athens, Munich and many other European
 cities walking late nights and they are all similar - no fear generated.
 Makes me think I may leave the US someday...

 Close enough to "see what they are doing" important phrase that.  Consider
 how leaders in the US now constantly "make war" but only at a distance.
 Regan had his invasions, Bush had his, and now Clinton has his. Personally,
 I would like to return to the times when leaders who made wars personally
 fought with the troops - like King Richard on the crusades - if something
 was worth a fight then it was often worth the leader fighting also. Not
 just cowardly sending some young soldiers out to fight and die.

 I guess I am saying that our national "spirit" has at least one aspect
 where too many people are willing to kill others for various reasons
 but usually at a distance and from relative saftey such as gunning down
 unarmed victums - be they individuals or countries. This is what much of
 America is coming to be - regardless of what we "say we stand for".


 On the other hand - I might note that MUCH of the spirit of the rave
 community is firmly and directly in opposition to this type of action.
 This is one of the reasons I find the core rave philosophy so appealing.
 I notice that within the community there are various groups some simply
 like a party, some like to listen to the music, some like to dance, etc.
 but many of the individuals also carry with them the desire to be open,
 to share good vibes and to spread love and brotherhood. This is one of
 the reasons - I personally don't like it when I go out to a gathering
 that turns out to be "the club scene". My definition of that is there
 is less of this open friendly vibe and it's more difficult to just
 hang out and talk with people. Balance that against F&F where so many
 people are introduced that the names begin to blur. Oh, my head hurts
 trying to remember - but it's a good hurt :-)


 Nuff said,

 Mike


 BTW I added to the Komotion poem:

 BECAUSE WE LIKE TO DANCE
 BECAUSE WE LIKE THE MUSIC
 BECAUSE WE CARE


 Because we do !

i have two articles in front of me about the rave mass, one from 15 april 1995  
when matthew fox's plans were announced, and the 31 oct 1995 article that's  
been discussed recently here.  both written by Don Lattin, both about 24  
column inches in length, both front page articles, and both talk about drugs  
at or near the end.

from 15 april:

	   Fox acknowledged that designer psychedelic drugs such as
	"Ecstasy" are popular in the Rave culture both in the United
	States and England.
	   "That's exactly what they (the sponsors of the Rave Masses
	in England) are trying to combat," he said.  "The Rave culture
	did not begin with drugs.  You can go drugs, or you can go
	religion, go transcendence, go for the spiritual power of
	community and ritual."

from 31 october:

	   "The look is 'rave,' but this feels like a different community,"
	said Strickland, a computer programmer from Menlo Park who heard
	about the Mass on the Internet.
	   "These people are not ravers," he said.  "No one here offered
	me any drugs."

two samples don't establish a pattern with much statistical confidence, though  
seeing these articles side-by-side makes me wonder if the reporter hasn't been  
trying to portray a particular image of the rave mass using whatever quotable  
material is at hand at the time.

regardless of how this positioning came to be, i might guess that the rave  
mass wouldn't have been welcomed at grace cathedral without assurances that  
laws would not be broken.  it was a pretty moving experience for me and i'm  
thankful that did happen.

I think you mean Glenn - he's a friend of mine, so I'll let you all know

Subject: re: sunset & tribes (fwd)

Just read them all.  It's quite a story all togther, hearing about the
strange gestalts: love and peace on one hand and out of control violence on
the other.  I don't know really what to do about it.  I was remarking to
someone at Sunset (maybe Victoria) that I really dug the cite because it
was urban and that we were dancing at the end of the world, etc.  That we
can not ignore the running down of our world and the dirt and the
nastiness, so we might as well celebrate it, consecrate the ground we dance
on, but in fact we are really naive to think we have any control over the
this world and it's disolution.  Unfortuantly we are slaves to our
particular cultures and upbringings, etc.  This is not to say that I don't
beleive that there can be change in this world, there can be, there is
wonderful zeitgeist happening in which you and I are part of, but we
shouldn't expect that our very presence is enough to make something good
happen.  We have to start small, with ourselves, and with luck our numbers
will grow.  I have to say that it's pretty cool there are so many kids in
the scene; I hope they can keep it together long enough to make a
difference...

Until soon,

Aye an' a bit of Mackeral settler rack and ruin

and I cried, cried, cried.

The fear a fallen down taken never back the raize

picking the fiery horde that was fallen around ma feet.

Never he cried, never shall it ye get me alive

Well I snatched fer the blade O my Claymore

Aye!

A roar he cried

dead as 'a can be by his feet; de ya ken?

...and the wind cried back.

Mijos, is there an afterparty tonite? I'd love to plan a late morning in
great numbers. Went to "king" 2 months ago, but that was kinda empty and
the music way to fast for an anticlimax, tweak or no tweak.
Last month we had that ill fated but warm hearted new moon. Cops with
melting faces! AHHHH!

Well, I guess CU in and of itself is enuf, but ya gotta dream, right? Oh,
man,talkin bout dreams,  I've been having dreams about a tiny contortionist
all week!Shoulda never seen Henry&June! 

Hope to see the flexably employed (or sleep resistant) among you, and lotsa
happy, manic grins tonite, if anyone has nrg left after this weekend. Damn
my calves! 

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

I wonder if the sunset crew stopped the music and all the ravers advanced
in one huge, unified, slow massive front, what would have happened? Sorta
like those big finales in movies like witness or some westerns, where the
folk rally behind the hero?

1) some of us might get shot.( I doubt it, they would have already)
2) some G-naifs would hide their guns and play dumb (REALLY dumb: it wuddin
me, ah sweah!)
3) the same might get really scared and run (or walk off and taunt us to
save face)
4) they might see that not only did they not get linched (or "lenched"),
but we give 'em a chance to fork over the goods, see what harm they did,
and chill out and understand, if not join,  the party.

are we big enuf inside to pick option 3, or even take what's behind curtain
4? I wonder if I am? But we (I was not there) should have not let groups of
2-4 people leave that sunset. We need to let tufs know, let ourselves know,
that we are there for more than just a party, that we look out for each
other and everyone else who wants our love.

We can talk about unity and all that nice, caring shit, but if we don't
mean it, it will never really happen. People won't bring guns and attitudes
to parties if they know that we WON'T GIVE THEM POWER thru fear, and if
they can't find a fight. Their whole existance is based on the power
chakra, if we stay above it, they can't touch us.

I don't mean no cheek turning, just make it clear to them that we are ONE
BIG WAD of unified people with no fear, and no hate.

Don't sweat it strick, I was there and I tend to agree with your observation.
If there is a lesson to be learned by all here, it is to BE VERY CAREFUL when
talking to _any_ media outside of the Family.  For the most part, the media is
not your friend and they will almost always quote you out of context, in their
inevitable search for "newsbytes".

As far as the Mass was concerned, I wanted It to set in a bit before I posted.
I didn't go to the Saturday Mass but attended the Sunday service.  There was
a pretty good crowd assembled outside, mostly non-raver types, a lot of
"older" people who, from the quality of the clothes that they were wearing,
had obviously achieved some "station" in life.  A line was formed outside
the basement entrance, people with tickets on the right, people without on the
left (the Mass was free, but they guessed correctly that they would have a lot 
of attendees hence the tickets).  I had about 20 tickets left over from being
at Ameba so I sat off to the side of the line and waited for friends and others
who needed tickets to show up.  As I did, I found it amusing that some of the
"rave" or "club" behavior is hard to kill.  I saw people who are "big" in the
Scene, attempt to get to the guest list :) and thus not have to wait in line :)
I also offered tickets to some "straight types" who seemed leary to accept them
(as if I were holding counterfits) and prefered to go all the way down to the
door and wait in a second line of people without tickets.  Several people
walking by wanted to know what was going on and a couple of ravers actually 
asked me "Who's spinnin", To which I replied "I donno, I think Christ" :)
I hope they took it for the joke that it was.  Some of the people from the
Mass came out and talked to me, they all definitely seemed like
"ravers" although of the Norther England variety ( fairly pale, and
different dress then we normally sport). All of the conversations that
I had with folks in the beginning were positive ones and they seemed
more interested in how I found out about it and what our scene was like
then in converting me to anything.  (A good sign in my opinion).
Eventually the doors opened and we all went inside.  The sanctuary that
they had created inside that Gym was absolutely beautiful.  The true
name of this "rave mass" was the Planetary Mass. And it did live up to
its name,  The alter was composed of two "tables" which were actually
designed along intersecting conic sections this gave the suggestion of
planetary motion, you sat on the floor basically around the alter (like
planets around the Sun) and the alter was at the same level as everyone
else.  Just like the solar system.  There were eliptical paths that
were traced out on the floor that would later be used during the actual
Mass and there was a diagram of what appeared to be a schematic of a
transfer orbit between two bodies (When I was young, I was really into
astrodynamics, but don't remember too much of it now, still the stuff
projected and the symbols on the floor were familiar to me from that
discipline).  The walls had several medium size video screens on them
projecting some beautiful abstract colorful patterns that would be
appropriate for the chill out room of any party, In fact as Alan Ameba
noted to me, it did seem to have the feel of a chill-out room.  There
were at least two intellabeams on both sides of the room and at least
one DataFlash, all of which was used sparingly, I didn't see any
lasers.  Over the alter, was a medium sized white "weather baloon" that
video was projected into, just like you would find at any of our
parties like Come-Unity or what ever. To the side, they had all of their
"Equipment", mixers, sound reinforcement, cameras, and a DJ set-up.

Yes, I would concur, being raised as an A.M.E. Episcopal and having done
"other things", I recognized that all the elements that make a Christian Mass
were there, but this was a Mass constructed by people who were
obviously Ravers, not people pretending to be, interspersed with thw form were
some beautiful and touching additions.  They had several dancers who were part
of the service, this, to me was very important, as dance is such an important
part of the spiritual experience for many of us; to not have incorporated it in
some way would have been a dead give away that something was wrong.  But they 
were there, there were oppertunities for the congregation to move there bodies
at various parts of the service but I felt the slots were way to short to be
effective.  But still for folks who came thinking raving is some form of satanic
drug taking ritual, I'm sure they got a dose of at least one group of raver's
reality. I, as some of you who know me, relate to the music and the energy in a
really physical way so it was really affirming to me to see a couple of
the members of that community "goin for it" while the music was playing, even
though I was not particularly moved by the music that the DJ was playing
(and there WAS a DJ), the fact that I could recognize that some of this group
have a special relationship to their bodies and the music was consoling to me
and went a long way to me perceiving this as a genuine offering of spirituality.
I do get the distinct feeling that if this Mass were done specifically for
the Family as opposed to a public media event, it would be longer and have
more dancing and other things that we would recognize.  Some of the elements
that are foreign to the Rave Family but important to the "Christian" side was
the need to sing, pray and afirm by the congregation.  This was the
part I was most uncomfortable with as it seemed the most unspontaneous
and rote, as if this had to be there to please someone else.  The
references to Christ kinda bothered me a little, not because I have any
problem with the Christ, but because I think there wasn't enough of an
effort made to distinguish the concept of the Cosmic Christ (which is
much more far reaching then what popular christianity or judaism can
perceive) from that of the historical one.  In essance, one point of
view about the cosmic christ is that this force in itsself doesn't
have a whole lot to do with the historical Jesus any more than SVR4
UNIX has to do with a SPARCstation or Pentium, you have different
vehicles or hardware, and the software can run on them all and
transcends the platform (still try running said software on a MAC:) is
there a profound lesson here? :).  Popular Christianity, and its
antecedents seem to be really caught up in the life and dealings of one
personna that lived a couple of thousand years ago and have completely
forgotten about the "demonstration" of the Christ Force that the life
of that persona symbolized.  The Cosmic Christ didn't just incarnate in
a small village in the middle east, the Chosmic Christ is a potential
that is latent in every living organism on the planet, it is our job to
realize and express that force.  I think the poeple who are behind the
Planetary Mass know and appreciate this although they may not express
it in the same way as I do, I, no longer being a "Christian" per say but
still acknowledging the Christ in us all.  I think the simple truth is
that the Planetary Mass is a Mass created and celebrated by some ravers
who happen to be Christian, this should not be a shock or cause anyone
dismay.  At parties there are many messages, the Wicked crew are openly
pagan and Yamoto (the non secular "tibetian monk") has showed up at
many of our gatherings without a lot of hoopla.  The bottom line
should be how these people treat you, each other, and the Scene at
large.  After the service, I talked with a few of them, they all seemed
to exhibit the friendlyness, warmth, exhuberance and "vibe" that other
people in the Scene have demonstrated.  They wanted to know what and
where the good parties were and seemed to be willing to go out and
experience them.  The subject of durgs did not come up and I can't
really be sure what their stance is on the subject, I know that E did
come up in a couple of my conversations with a  few of them and it is
obvious to me that regardless of their positions now, many of them have
experienced psychedelics.  My guess is that by and large they realize
that psychedelics, while possibly being useful tools for an individual,
are not the source of spirituality itself, nor more than a crucifix is
or the communion or bitter herbs, they are "tools on the path" nothing
more.  Of course the best thing to strive for is to be self generating,
I'm sure at least some of you have been to parties where the Vibe has
been so strong that you get a contact E high even though the only thing
that you've been drinking is water.  That energy manifestation is just
as much an aspect of the Cosmic Christ as it is of a Kundalini rush or
an experience of Communitas.  Ultimately the Mass should be about a
celebration of a state of consciousness that is reached or strived for,
the Planetary Mass in my opinion achieved that end for the celebrants.
While talking to them I discovered that they all live together in communities,
in this respect they are more advanced then their American counterparts, it
does however harken me back to Steve's Farm in North Carolina where a bunch
of "Christian Hippies" bought land in the late sixties/early seventies and
formed a commune that is still alive and thriving today.  Ultimately they
came to the realization that changes in the world take generations and the
bast way to shape the future is through the efforts of relationship and family.
I also hear that some of them are coming here to start a community, at the
present time I believe that if the ones who come are like the people that
I have met, then San Francisco will definitely receive a blessing.

wow geoff well said.... 

now for the story of a nice jewish rave woman going to church... 

    I went to rave mass on sunday and thought the room and the set up was
cool...basically the visuals surpassed most parties i go to, with
intellibeams and like 9 or so video screens and a big orb in the 
center...i can only   

    If i were episcopalian or even christian i probably would have had a
better time...infact i would go to church all the time if i chose to
"breath in christ"....entertainment for the "masses"... but forget it i
chose not to be brainwashed...so i applaud mathew fox and sheffield 
club kid crew for doing something progressive within their religion...but 
taking a global perspective i think it sucked... 

    this mass preached "environmentalism" (did they talk about carpooling
or living near where you work ...noooo) "love" "how bad death culture is" 
blah blah blah...it said nothing about psychadellic culture, homophobia,
sexuality, sensuality, freeing your body through dance and music, aids,
the net...blah blah blah... 

    the two most appauling incidents of the night...1. they told anyone 
who wanted to take communion could "just follow the person infront of you 
if you don't know how" (ahhhhhhh!!!!! baaaaaaaaa!!! sheep!) and 2. they 
quoted frasher clark (ahhhhh!!!) also they kept talking about being saved 
and the denial we are in (denial aint just a river in egypt, honey 
*snap)     

     also i felt like i was at a moby concert...cuz most of the music was
on tape ( and not even on dat...) ...!!!!!!  infact i was watching the dj
person and she was pretending part of the time to mix...(ahhhhhh!!!) also
they had a heater on...to make the place feel like a sweat box...also i
was there sunday not saturday...but what the hell is jerry garcia doing
there...??? just wondering??? 
         
    so for a contrived show i would give it a moby/amy grant rating...and 
for a rave...i wouldn't even use the term...for a religious event...it was
probably one of the best looking i have been too...susie(: 
 
     p.s. this reminds me of a fable we talked about in my art history 
class...there once was this acrobat in church and he couldnt read the 
prayers or anything...all he could do was flips...so one night he starts 
doing flips manically in front of the altar....and "god" saw the arcrobat 
going at it...and accepted the flips as prayers and devotion...

friends and fam,

I havent' been to C/u in a long time.  Is it still 21+?  Will there be a time
after which it won't be?

thanks a lot,
stevie

p.s.  it goes almost without saying that F&F IV was the best party ever.  The
5 relatively-if-not-completely-newbies I dragged along agreed.  Thanks to
all!  The only problem is that ironically i felt so inspired by the party that
i had to leave; as a friend of mine put it, my "consciousness had expanded
beyond the party".  What raves need are a realtively quiet creation/con-
templation space; or, all ravers just need to learn sign language to commun-
icate.

I certainly agree with you there.  So many times I've wanted to just talk 
to some of the terrriffic people i meet, but I can't cuz it's too loud 
and intense.  But come to think of it, isn't that what the ambient rooms 
are for?

Acshully, I went to a rave called Dreamtime and there was a big group of 
people (about 10) that all talked to each other in sign language.  It was 
pretty impressive.  Not only that but at FF4 my friend Louise met someone 
who could read lips!  As for the quiet space, I definitely agree.  It is 
really great when a rave has a chillout/ ambient place where everyone can 
just talk/ eat fruit/ show off their wonderful toys!!

Yeah, it's still 21+ and i've never heard of any plans to change that but 
i wouldn't know because i've been out of town for a while.  (Though still 
keeping in touch and i will be back in 28 days and counting.)  There was 
that fundraiser for Malachy in July which was announced as 18+ for a 
while but then turned out to be 21+ i guess for permit reasons. (It was 
at Townsend--it was really fun but i always get that night confused with 
the Wicked that was in the same place one week before that.)  What bugs 
me is the thing of only going till 3:30.  I would much rather see an all 
night Come/Unity, at a different location if necessary.  What's the scoop 
on that--is 3:30 a permanent thing or a temporary thing?

P.S. i'm a new subscriber, but i've been reading sfraves for a while 
now.  My deal is i moved from berkeley to new jersey for school in 
september but i'm super unpsyched to be here so i'm coming back.  
Meanwhile i am taking the opportunity to check out the NYC scene and 
watch the leaves turn in New Jersey.

Ideas on what to do with the Komotion space will definitely be
appreciated! I believe the idea this time was to give the DJs in both
rooms more of a free hand in what they play.

Personally, I think Komotion's hallways aren't big enough for a
designated chill space. We tried, and a lot of people got stepped on,
etc. I feel this is unsafe; if we had to get everyone out in a big
hurry, i.e. a fire, people sitting in the halls could be trampled and
things might get really ugly for everyone. I don't speak for anyone
but myself, but I think it'd be a good idea to try hard to comply with
fire codes and avoid easily preventable disasters.

Fortunately, ins&outs are allowed and the water is free. The sidewalk
outside isn't exactly a TAZ, but it is cool and reasonably quiet.
Hopefully, the new ventilation plans will impove things. Who knows?
Maybe the floor will stay dry next time ;).

Sean

One thing that you always have to keep in mind with the press is that
they usually have an agenda. They have preconceived notions and are
looking for "sound bites" to back them up. They can cut up what you say
and make it mean something totally different than what you were saying
just by leaving out a few words or sentences. Beware. I know this from
personal experience.

One thing that you, Strick, can do is to write letters to the editor
saying what you meant and that you were joking to get the reporter to
quit asking you so many stupid questions and you can say what raves are
about. But of course any letter to the editor has to be concise BUT brief
to get published. That isn't always easy.

simple hold a chillout party at komotion...ie bring your bean bag 
chairs...(:(: infact i am surprised there is no weekly chillout party in 
this city....you would think noone likes ambient music (; 

also come/unity/1015 let minors in after 2:30 not 3:30 cuz they stop 
selling booze at 2:00...and since there is no booze they can't get in as 
much trouble by letting in 18+ ...but state alchol codes say you can't 
allow a minor into a place with open alcohol even if the bar is 
closed...the bar must be physically entirely closed off..and it probably 
requires different permitts...so....you know how i feel on this topic...

This sounds very much like what happened at our MESS party at candlestick 
park.  Is this the same place?  I'm very sorry to read of people in our 
family hurting other people in our family.  My heart goes out to all of 
you who experienced this.  I know it is a hard thing to go through.
About the police response time:  Often, areas characterized by lots of 
violence between people of color get late responses from the police.  
Pardon my cynicism, but I believe that this is part of the process of 
genocide against these communities.  When violence broke out at our 
party, an ex-Navy Seal medic called the police for us and said something to 
the effect of "I've got fifty college kids stuck in the middle of a gang 
war," in his best "ordering people around" voice.  He also told the 911 
operator exactly how many squad cars and ambulences to send, as well as 
requesting a helicopter on standby.  That got quick results.  I guess you 
just have to speak their language.

much love,
whitsitt

right on, Dave!

I see tribal-ism (for lack of a better word) as a product of connection.  
A group of people with a common connection is a tribe. How you manage 
this connection is important, though.  A tribe can be part of a greater 
community, or a tribe can be a warring faction.  I think the thing to do 
is to extend those connections in all directions.  Become a native of 
the Earth that supports us.  Learn about the people in your community 
(four-leggeds, too), learn about the land beneath you, the sky above 
you.  Make your innerself a community (no self denial or repression), 
make that part of the community around you, make that part of the larger 
community, and so on until it's universal.
Fasion is cool, pop culture is cool, all that shit is cool.  But life 
runs deeper, so see me for who I really am and call me by my real name.

love,
whitsitt

My guess is they can only get a permit for going all night 
in the basement; probably because of the noise at street level.
It could also be more difficult midweek.

PROTEST MESSAGE:
Recognizing that the principle involved in the British Criminal
Justice Bill now awaiting final approval by the House of Lords
involves the banning of "gatherings of more than 10 people on
public land" may eventually be introduced into my home country
and eventually Internet "gatherings" in the public land of
Cyberia, we, the Undersigned, protest with all our hearts and
will. And we implore you to do all in you power to erase this
shamefull bill and its intention from planetary consciousness.

In theory.  But most ambient rooms are too loud and intense, too.  Most ambient
DJs don't realize that playing ambient music at deafeningly loud volumes does
*not* create a relaxing atmosphere.

as an ambient DJ, i certainly ~do~ realize this.  however, the challenge in
ambient rooms at major functions is to make oneself heard over a 5kW system,
when you have a 500W system at your disposal, and little or no sound
isolation.  i once had the exciting challenge of playing ambient on a home
stereo system that was in the same room as a 1.5kW system.  talk about
fun!  the people sitting directly in front of the speakers could hear, but
no one else could, until i beat matched/sound matched with the music coming
from the main system.  a very useful experience.

as always, i recommend talking directly to the DJ if the music is too loud.
i, for one, am always happy to turn things down.  i suspect that other DJs
will turn it down, too, provided they don't later get more complaints about
not being able to hear the music over the dance music.

I never could get the hallway level right at F&F. The door staff would
say it's too loud outside so I'd turn it down, then an F&Fer would
come by and say it's not loud enough please turn it up. Ack!  Well,
the monitors were loud enough, so I was having fun :).

(One lady came up to me 2 or 3 times during my acid trance set and
asked me to play "happier" stuff. I just smiled :). She must not have
read my shirt...)

Maybe Popular Electronics (or HSC) has a project kit for a visual
sound pressure level meter. Then we could put it somewhere high up in
the room where the DJ could see it, tweak the sound till it's right,
and get an all-night visual on it. The meters on the mixer don't seem
to be as useful as I thought.  And then again I should probably get
that compressor/limiter I've been threatening to get; then I could
firewall the mixer all day and it'd be the right sound level (though
most mixers add a lot of distortion when pegged).

One of the things that blew my mind when I first started buying
records is how *good* they sounded through headphones (and through
Ethan's system -- thanks, Ethan). I have missed _so_much_ of the music
because I went to a lot of events with lousy sound.  So nowdays I
really want to enable people to hear all the music. It's a lot more
fun that way. :)

Sick and twistedly yours,

Sean

THUS SPAKE rox@netcom.com (Roxanna Stieber):
# 
# One thing that you, Strick, can do is to write letters to the editor
# saying what you meant and that you were joking to get the reporter to
# quit asking you so many stupid questions and you can say what raves are
# about. But of course any letter to the editor has to be concise BUT brief
# to get published. That isn't always easy.

I thought of that, but complaining really just brings the "d" word
up with a lot more readers, and it's really not in *my* theory of the
TAZ to seek that kind of media attention, anyway.  (No criticism of
those who do, it's certainly panther-modern to work the media,
it's just not my thing.  Then why was I talking with a reporter,
you ask?  Because we had just held hands in a large circle and danced 
and prayed together for two hours...)



I'll be attending The Hackers' Conference this weekend.  You're all
aware what the media has done with the word "hacker", and "cyberpunk",
to equate them with "criminal".  I think Real Hackers don't whine about
it all that much, and might even delight in the confusion.  On the last
page of [W]I[R]E[D] editor Kevin Kelly's recent book "Out Of Control",
under "About the Author", it says "... involved in launching ... The
Hackers' Conference, an annual gathering of computer mavericks and
outlaws" -- obviously not distancing himself from the controversy.

And for the last two years I've been a practicing cypherpunk, a group
that will probably be remembered by much of the media for the closing
words of Tim May's signature "..., black markets, collapse of
government" than for their more-than-pro-active defense of freedom of
speech and privacy.  I think this will be the case, despite some
excellent articles by the likes of Steven Levy and John Markov in
[W]I[R]E[D], NYT, NYT Sunday Magazine, and other influential journals.
But the positive spin so far has probably been due to EFF, CPSR, &
EPIC -- not to PGP and anonymous remailers (which, BTW, this list
would seem to reject, since I can only post to it as
strick@osc.versant.com and not as strick@gwarn.versant.com or 
strick@versant.com or strick@yak.net).

It's the fate of both the hackers and the cypherpunks to be cast by
the media as criminals.  I'm comfortable with that reality.



I don't think the rave community can or should expect more media
coverage or better coverage without selling short the magick of the
TAZ.  Hakim Bey's idea is that when the authorities begin to notice
you, it's time to change your name, scatter, and form new spontaneous
circles elsewhere.  The tazzes of rave communities certainly exemplify
that spirit.

After a week of discussing the depressing topic of violence (which is NOT 
a bad thing to do)  I am ready to get psyched up for the weekend!!

I am wondering who all out there is going to be going to Basics on Saturday?
I can't wait!!!! I haven't been out to a party since September 17th and 
I've never been to a Basics or Gathering that disappointed me.  I am so 
looking forward to hearing Tony again. He's been my favorite for years!!

I want to meet some of you out there.  Everybody on this list is just 
wonderful and I'd love the opportunity to meetcha!!:)

luv to all,
Amy

Here it is a little earlier this week - I've been busy at work and not
getting around to sending this till the evening lately.

Basics seems to be the big show this weekend...  Some new things to check
out might be the Eighth House or the Gardening Club.  There's also a lot
of stuff in the weeklies I haven't heard anything about, so everyone check
them out and report back to me :).  There are several new listings in the
radio show section, so give that another look too.

Seems like there should be a new moon party coming up too, but I don't have
the date...

I see why Geoff has mixed feelings.  Mail bombs are still bombs and virtual
violence is still essentialy violent if not all that harmful.  The
unfortunate recipients are innocent and that smacks of terrorist style if
only in a virtual sense.  I got some mail the other day that was sent to
every NETCOM subscriber so it had the longest TO: I've ever seen. Irritating
as all hell and then some idoit replied to it genrating another TO: monster!
Its much better just to sneak up on these governments with our useful,
friendly little net until one day they have no control over much of anything.
 I don't think this kind of behaviour qualifies as voting either. Using the
net to just protest something with mail bombs is a gross underuse of it
social power and just results in negative press( and a possible backlash from
governments to try and get it back under control.)

People email bomb because it's easy. I heard at least 100 people
grumble about the SF cabaret laws, but only knew one person who put
real effort into it by talking to civic leaders and getting people to
sign petitions.

Will mailbombing actually effect change? Will all the victims be
sympathetic? Was the man pulled out of his truck in the LA riots and
beaten nearly to death turned to the cause?

Sometimes strong measures are justified...just think about whether
they are likely to accomplish your goals (or the opposite) and whether
your victim is appropriate.

To anyone who has not yet met her, she is one of those sacramento nomads

Greetings!  I've been taking some personal time off, and have been
reading the stellar reviews of Friends and Family.  As I said before,
it was truly a group effort, and loads of fun to be a part of. A couple
of people have asked about records I played, so here's my set, as best
I can remember:

Artist		Cut			Label		Catalog
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trinity		The Sweet Mercy		Bush		Bush 1008
Atlanta Falls	Reach Up		Razor		RAZR 003
Exoterix	Void(Diss-Cuss)		Positiva	12TIV-1 AA
Interactive	Dildo(Interactive)	Zyx		6655-12
Depeche Mode	Master & Servant	Mute		L12-BONG6
Lil' Justin	Ah Baby			Madhouse	KCT1003
Cypher		Acid Love		Sorted		SO 20097
Tracid Posse	Power of Darkness	Over/Drive	LC 6695/OVER-017-12
Underground Resistance-Orbit		UR		UR 002
Union Jack	Two Full Moons+A Trout	Rising High	RSN 81
Resonant Interval  Memory		BMU		004
PWOG		Out Now			KK		08-026914-20
Orbital		The Naked & The Dead	Internal	Radiccio 2
Conemelt	Wallop			Sabres of Paradise PT012
Gilgamesh	Trescore		Fragile		FRG-8
D-Shake		L Trip-a-luna		ThunderPussy	THP 2009-1
Red Planet	WarDance		Submerge	RP-5c

The subtitle of the Depeche Mode song is "an ON-USound science fiction
dance hall classic".  I purchased this EP about 10 years ago, but you
might find it in the used bins somewhere.  Some one asked about the
song that went "Put it in, put it in": that was Interactive's "Dildo".
The Conemelt song, "Wallop", is a bonus in the Sabres of Paradise EP,
_Sabresonic_ (or, at least, that's where I find it in my crate :-) and
has that oh so weird distorted-processed-synthed guitar sound alternating
with sparse acid percussion toward the end of my set; it's my current
favorite. Enjoy!

Hi all,

I'm new to this list, but have been on Socal raves for a year or so.. I 
know some of you, and I'm sure I'll meet more soon. It sounds like SF has 
a nice scene. Very sorry to hear of the violence lately.

Just wondering if anyone is planning on venturing down here to LA for the 
Orbital show on the 26th.

A few of you who usually make the big LA shows and combine it with a 
trip to Joachims Friday night KUCI radio show will be happy to know that the
show is now broadcast live from the pub at UCI. Very cool vibe.
Live DJs each week, plus some live bands. We played there for his show 2 
weeks ago with David Alvarado and Taylor. This week will be Deep Squared..

So, if anyone is coming down for the 26th, come down on the 25th instead 
and we'll have a grand time..

see y'all

	Do I remember correctly that someone recorded a party recently?  
And if yes is it going to be distributed?  There hasn't been any 
offerings lately of tapes of parties and I need some new music since all 
my tapes were stolen from my car.  We need Bob Ramstad back in town  :)

See Ya,

Come check out The Gardening Club.  It's a weekly ambient/dub party that 
my partner Alan and I along with Djs Graham (Darkhorse) and Charles 
Edwards just started.  It's at the Caribbean Zone, which is a cool little 
restaurant space with a jungle-like atmosphere (plants/waterfalls) and an 
actual airplane embedded in the  wall that seats 20-30 people!

Last week was our first week and it was really excellent.

This week features residents Graham and Charles
with special guest Markie.

Visuals by yours truly...

Come one, come all...

It has long been obvious to me that genocide is the only way to describe 
what is being done to people of color, especially black people. The war 
on drugs is a shabbily veiled method destroying any cohesive effort 
attempted by "urban" (i.e. black/minority) communities to regain control 
over their own lives and to form stable communities.

Let's face it -- busting alot of dudes with a few rocks does absolutely 
nothing to prevent drug use. And giving *life sentences* to a people 
selling even a crumb of crack is ludicrous. But that is The Law in 
Georgia; don't know about elsewhere.

And even if one isn't holding or selling, but gets flagged down by 
cops, interrogated and maybe physically searched, it is an obvious 
terror-tactic and violates the Bill of Rights, which we are all supposedly 
guaranteed.

Another egregious agenda is the militant targeting of cannabis by county, 
state, and federal agencies. Yeah, sure, coke busts have more glamour, but I 
don't notice any shortage of *cocaine* in this country, despite the fact 
that the requisite plant won't even _grow_ here, and must therefore be 
imported at great personal risk.

Cannabis, however, grows anywhere and everywhere, yet there are 
"droughts" every year; during which the herb is almost impossible to 
procure except in certain parts of the country (NoCal being one :) ).
Hmmm... now why should *that* be? 

These droughts are always during the summer, too. I used to think that 
this was due to the harvest cycle. But in todays world of indoor 
production and hydroponics, that just doesn't make sense. And there is 
one fact that I know to be true -- riot-type behavior occurs far more 
frequently during the peaks of summer's heat. (stats available)

And people who are peacefully stoned don't tend to foment violent social 
unrest.

Sorry this was so long -- there are alot of excellent minds on the list, 
and I wanted the feedback as "consensual crime" issues are very important 
to me.

TIA...

I know it's sometimes hard to remember when one has just been having a 
lovely happy sharing time, but it's a sad fact of life that there are 
folks out there who find ravers a very easy target. Some of us just 
aren't very careful, and for the most part we are predictable when 
threatened by force; we are peaceful people and violence tends to baffle us. 
Plus we aren't usually armed.

Fortunately, the best way to deal with potential hazards is also the 
easiest -- *prevent them*. A few ways:

1) Do NOT leave the area of the party alone. Take someone (or two 
someones) with you -- a few folks might think you are paranoid, but 
you'll be safer, which is what counts, right?

1a) Be aware of your surroundings as you walk to or from different areas. 
If you're alert, it shows; you are thereby a riskier target for attack.

2) Check the area around any vehicle you are planning to get into; and 
make sure you have the proper keys ready *before* you get to the car. 
Standing there with your head down, fumbling with the keyring, makes you 
an easy target.

2a) Look inside the car before you get in -- make certain that there is 
no one waiting in the backseat or on the floor.

3) Consider carrying that whistle that everyone is sick of on your 
keyring -- a piercing blast from one of those can give you the moment you 
need to safely flee.

4) Do NOT refuse to hand over your stuff; it's replaceable. You aren't.

----------->

The seemingly contradictory fact is, women who fight rape attempts stand 
a better chance of escaping unscathed (or less scathed?) than women who 
meekly comply. Apparently, resistance confuses persons of that ilk to 
some extent, and they will seek out an easier victim.
Speaking from personal experience, I can attest to this.
However, do NOT fight back if you feel it is unsafe to do so. Trust 
yourself to make that judgement.

As always -- if your attacker is wielding a firearm, it is too risky as a 
rule to resist with _any_ kind of force or physical evasion.

I really hated to be the one to post this in some ways, but hey, if it 
helps someone sometime, I don't mind being the Voice of Caution ;)

As a community, we can adapt to these conditions without ruining our fun -- 
we just need to help one another. 

And we're already so good at that :) :) :)


*Love & Hugs*

	Yes indeed ComeUnity lived up to it's name this weekend.
	I got there about 12:30 and I was pretty tired from events 
	during the week.  The firts thing I noticed was no crowd of
	underagers and such hanging around the door.  (there was a reason
	for this, e-mail me privately if you really want to know)
	the second thing I noticed is that the ambient sound level around
	the club was _way_ down.  Either they had turned it doen or Ira has
	installed some serious sound insulation.  When I entered I was relieved
	to discover that the latter was apparently the case though the inside
	volume was a bit lower then usual, but still sufficient enough in
	order to "feel it".

	The club was full but not packed as most ComeUnities are these days.
	I guess most folks had not recovered from the Samhain weekend and
	just couldn't crank it up (no pun intended) to go out during the week.
	Speaking of which, even though I did notice the telltale sniffing and
	nose grabbing of a person on tweak, it seemed like far fewer people
	were doing this.  The vibe was definitely not a meth vibe at all.

	Garth was on when I got there, people were dancing but not really going
	off, it has been said (though not by me :) that Garth only has two
	kinds of records, really good one and real cheesy ones, some of the
	stuff he played I bet came in "individually wrapped singles" :)
	Still I had fun listening, dancing and complaining around his set.
	Regardless of what he played early on he redeamed himself in the end
	because he brought out the ACIEEEED! Yup that right, he started playing
	some pretty good classic but dancable acid house and made the perfect
	set up for Jeno to take over.

	Jeno did indeed step to the plate and continue where Garth left.  A lot
	of newbies (who mostly have never heard the one true acid house music)
	sort of stopped dancing in puzzlement but the True Believer came out of
	the woodwork to take their place :) By 2:30 he was into a serious
	groove.  And pretty soon I got that familiar feeling of slipping into
	trance, this made me happy because I haven't been there in a long time.
	He moved through his chouces masterfully mixing new stuff with old,
	now that I've been buying records and attempting to mix myself I 
	see the music and DJs performances from a different viewpoint.  I must
	say that I was happy to just be there and dance and actually delighted
	in the fact that he played stuff, none of which I have in my crate.
	All in all Jeno ripped it up.  The smile and hug factor was high and the
	crowd was incredibly diverse without any "gangsta attitude".

	If this is an indicator of what Basics will be like then it should be
	a good party. See you there.

ACTUALLY...The pub will be closed then, so it won't have 
a bar/kitchen to get service from, BUT Sfraver Joe Rice will be spinning
so you might as well make the trip anyhow, and you can catch
LA's top ambient club, Public Space, as well...

To vunsvbscribe from sfraves or any other list running off of majordomo, 
send a message to majordomo@hyperreal.com.  In this message, *not* the 
subject header, but in the body of the message, write:

	vnsvbscribe sfraves

That's it.  If that doesn't work (I guess it didn't since I never saw 
your requests on sfraves), then mail the list owner (Brian in this case).

Sorry, I forgot some important info.

The Gardening Club is on MONDAY nights.
The Caribbean Zone is at 55 Natoma (right next door to DV8)
I believe it's 21+ because there's a bar, however the space *is*
a restaurant and though our party is after they close, we are 
planning to serve up some vegetarian goodies of our own.  I'll post
as soon as the 18/21 gets resolved.

See you at Basics!

Tony

Being off of sfraves for a few days and reading the above post...I thought
sf was going thru a rash of violent occurences.

In due respect to dennis bartom who I'm sure meant well with his quote
"Very sorry to hear of the violence lately." and then followed by Maui's
great "SAFETY" post, I couldn't stop myself from thinking of the possible
consequence if those 2 posts were taken out of context (like I did until a
friend told me otherwise), and started snowballing into negativity.

To be specific, let's make the point that he was referring to **ONE**
incidence of violence only at an outdoors event.

After all haven't we learned just a few days ago from the "Rave Mass"
article (front page?) in the Chron, that we "ravers" are all drug users...
(Yes, according to Strick, A joke taken out of context).
Oh my, I can hear those suburban "house wives" screaming now! "Those ravers
are all drug addicts, where is our world going to".
You know how things go...

Just want to make sure that the SF rave scene does not get bashed by
misinformation. ;>

Certainly I would NOT enlist formal security. Advise people. Invite 
people who can play the part of tuffguy if necessary. Invite people 
who have practiced martial arts. Invite people whom you know can take 
responsiblity for their own safety. Let people know that wandering 
from the site in small groups may be dangerous. Of course be sure to 
have a cell phone for emergencies!

Thanks Maui for your informed post. It's  a real bother to have to 
deal with this kind of stuff, but that's how our world is.  It's ugly 
in a lot of places. 

A smile and an invitation to the party might be 
appropriate in mild cases of intimidation, but keep in mind that it 
takes YEARS of social training and lots of the various forms of 
social degradation to create real tuffguys. I consider it a cultural 
disease combined with population vs. resources imbalances. It's 
really, really ugly. And there's this phenomenon, I think of it as 
the dynamic of our government and our media...it WANTS us to be 
STOOPID...to comply and gobble up whatever the TV says...it teaches 
us to be afraid...so we stay inside our houses at night feeding on 
the scary stories of the cruel world and live in mortal fear of 
having to deal with whatever is lurking outside the door. All too 
often it's Uncle Sam himself lurking outside making a big display on 
the street about "fighting crime" when often the guy in cuffs is 
there because he had a bag of weed in his pocket or maybe a warrant 
for not appearing in court two months ago for an illegal U-turn. I 
loved it when the FBI showed up at our warehouse looking for this guy 
named Bob, apparently classified as "armed and dangerous". They were 
doing two-by-two maneuvers all around the building. TONS of them. 
Bob's real crime was being the business partner of a guy who got busted for 
IRS fraud. Bob was AGAINST citizens owning guns...the FBI told us 
that Bob was a compulsive liar and a schizophrenic.

There IS violence in our world, but there is far LESS of 
it than there was 200 years ago. But now we have technological 
advances to make us more efficient at killing. So we have to be more 
efficient with our self protection too. I'd never condone owning a 
gun for personal protection in the city...but what about mace? I know 
it's un-PC, but I honestly believe that it's a good alternative to be 
able to disarm and disable your attacker. Especially for 
stereotypically "easy" targets...small people, women, elderly 
people...people who could not physically break the grasp of a mugger. 
Supposedly many muggers will balk at the sight of a mace can (or even 
a can of hairspray!). I used to live in a REALLY tough area in East 
Oakland. People used to harrass me a lot. I got into several scary 
situations. I started carrying mace, openly, when I walked around the 
neighborhood. Never had a trouble again! And I never needed to use 
it. And martial arts! Most of the martial arts are NOT specifically 
geared towards aggressive, competitive fighting. Most are simply 
physical conditioning combined with some good common  sense about 
self-defense. I know an Aikido Sensei who begins his first classes by 
telling people that he is going to teach them how to run away from 
conflict...and then that is what he teaches...how to disarm someone 
to gain distance and a margin of safety.

ay yi yi! I could go on forever about this stuff...hope ya'll at 
least find it somewhat entertaining!

Babbling off.

Meth vibe? Scratchy nose? Well, my nose was itching and I was scratchin' 
it while reading this (Geoff's) post... no meth involved -- my nose just 
itches.

Methinks the truth be that some folks are jerks, meth or no. And it  
is also true that there are plenty of nice people who are on meth. Don't 
mistake a fairly simple chemical effect for a person's innately more complex 
behavioral patterns.


                   meat vibe?

Hello !
 I just received a message from Fraser Clark.
He's looking for people to help him launch an email campaign
against the new Criminal Justice bill in the UK.

Would anyone who is UNIX literate and who has access to a server / 
service provider be willing to help?
 They're really nice people, and despite their somewhat
rocky relationship with the sfraves community I think that they have
a worthy cause and could use the support...

Seems there wasn't much relevance in the Fox news at 10 report on the 
afterhours underground scene in LA. The report was entirely directed toward 
the clubs that openly sell alcohol. It seems that the only relevance to the 
"rave" scene may be in reference to the problem of enforcing fire 
regulations. Drugs were almost a non-issue as the focus was definately on 
illegal sales of alcohol. I guess not to worry for now. 

Did anyone catch the LA times article today?  Any comments would be welcome.

I kinda stumbled upon this flyer thursday for a dance friday night at 
college 8.  the dj's were donut and shilo, among others ( i THINK there 
were others ).  Anyway, I ended up stumbling on this party that was 
really a cool little rave!  There were so many friendly people there!  
Incredible.  Too bad it only went until 12:50 am.  But that was 20 
minutes longer than I expected it to go.  

SUMMARY

Vibe- really high.  

Music-good, fast, and plenty of that mind-shattering techno.  :)

Water-get your own at the drinking fountain.  (if i had a cup,
	i would have helped myself to a soda, (it was in the dining hall (where
	the students, like pig out on paper food))). 

Hand Stamps-A planet with a ring around it.  Definitely fashionable.  If 
	it doesn't wash completely off in the shower tomorrow morning, believe 
	me, I won't be heartbroken.  

and most of all...
I got to meet Kia <amaranth>!

see you all at wbl at live soup on sunday night.  bring pillows!--->deepfog

I must agree that this thing went *off* - lots of happy people, and some
very familiar faces from friendss & family as well!  "Hey, you go to
UCSC??  Wow!!"  It's great to see so many scravers getting together.. :)

THanks to all the guys who put this on!  (Somebody pass the word along to
donut that he's an awesome dj if he's not subscribed!)  The music was
great, the vibe was great, the sound system was great (who'dathought that
college 8 would have such a cool set of speakers??) the music was great,
the candy was great (thanks John & Matt!) and even the space was pretty
cool.  It had sort of a warehouse feel to it..  I can't believe it all
happened at MY school too! Santa Cruz needs more stuff like this..  I'm 
looking forward to the next one.. :)

And since I've been to busy to post about friends and family.. Well, what
can I say?  I was speechless!  That's what raves are supposed to *be*!
awesomeawesomeawesomehappybouncinghuggingsmilinglovinggrinningsfravers
everywhere!!  Thank you *so* much Bryce and Ethan especially, and the guys
at Komotion, and *everyone* who helped out and came and brought such a great 
vibe along!  It was my friend Eden's first rave, and I think we've got her
hooked..  She couldn't believe how wonderful everybody was and what a great
time she had.. :)

See y'all at WBL!  (I'm bringing pillows toooo)  :)

k

p.s.  Eden and I gave away two *big* bags of turn-everything-blue blo-pops
      at f&f..  Next time our goal is to give *everyone* blue tongues!

I'm tall, caucasian, male, long light brown hair, and I'll be wearing
my big white T-shirt with a _giant_ picture of Bach on the front and

Can't say if Maui is going... she's still got the flu on and off.

you should have seen this show on the other night
i forget the exact name of it, but it was some new tv show with one
of the characters being a young teenager, who has her own problems,
but is really a pretty smart cookie.  anyways, they through this
party, and people are getting drunk, and somehow her friend takes 
"2 hits of ecstasy".   so her friend is really drunk and e'ing...
quite a likely combo IMO...  acting all weird and crazy at this party.
the friend's mom comes home, kicks everyone out and then goes to work.
 
i think the show was on FOX too.

this nice good teenager calls her mom about her friend(who is now very sick).
her mom knows what to do and how to take care of the girl, they rush her
to the hospital...

the mom just blew me away.  she goes into this whole story with her 
daughter (the smart one who chose not to do x) turns out she had a best 
friend in college who died taking drugs(i think ecstasy it was ecstasy, but 
i'm not 
sure...)  it was so aweful...it just reminded me of those crazy pot movies
from the 50s(maybe earlier, around the time marijuana was criminalized)...

all the false information.   i felt nauseous watching it...
it was so awfully BAD


this woman portrayed herself as an expert though she had 0 real 
information about the drugs in the story, and a FOAF story that just did not 
sound 
realistic to me at all.  how many people out there in tv land will believe
what they saw on that show?
the content of the show was utter crap.  but people will believe it...

 "My So-Called Life" - I was channel surfing and caught the storyline
at the party scene.

 It was left unsaid - just a similar situation with a college friend that 
had done unspecified drugs.

 To come to the defense of a fictional character ( shades of Murphy Brown/Dan
Quayle!) - she did not portray herself as an expert , just as someone who
had a better idea of what do to than her daughter and the unconcious gal's
boyfriend. She was reacting more to what the condition of the gal was - it
was obvious that anyone in that gal's condition needed emergency help.

 From what little she said , the implication was that she was in the same
room with her college friend when that friend OD'd. So , not a FOAF case.

 Being somewhat of the "mom's" generation , I remember that it was a fad
then ( 1970's ) to mix quaaludes (downers) and alcohol - which did kill a
bunch of folks. Of course , this wasn't in the storyline - just a reference
from my experience. If the folks you were partying with didn't know you
had done 'ludes on top of booze , then when you went unconcious , they may 
think you had just passed out .

 I do agree that the mentioning of ecstasy was probably an attempt by the
writers to keep the drug references current. They had the doper gal staggering
around the party saying that she loved everybody that she bumped into.

 SO - what about mixing E and booze?

Meth vibe? Scratchy nose? Well, my nose was itching and I was scratchin' 
it while reading this (Geoff's) post... no meth involved -- my nose just 
itches.

Methinks the truth be that some folks are jerks, meth or no. And it  
is also true that there are plenty of nice people who are on meth. Don't 
mistake a fairly simple chemical effect for a person's innately more complex

Topher, a raver , dj and club kid extrordinaire has fallen from an 
extreem height and is at SF general hospital in a coma.

I just visited him and he is stable but has major complications.
I never fully understood what the deal with all of the ravers and 
promotors who made Malachi's accident such a major affair. I only met 
malachi after he was paralyzed. I wanted to go to basics tonight but I 
can not imagine what it would be like telling tophers many friends that 
he may never be the same, while they are raving. 

Topher was just about to release a really good tape, so I am sure that he 
felt as Malachi did  , that raving was not mindless partying.

If any one feels like picking me up at ameba I would love to go to basics .
I'll be at ameba till midnight.

hug people  ,  salutations, allen@ameba

Hi everyone!

The Sound Traffic Control 3-D sound animation shows are coming up this
Thursday and Friday.  These shows will highlight a 3-D surround sound
system like nothing you've ever heard before - except maybe if you've
gone to the Audium.  They also feature some of the best ambient
DJ & musician talent in the Bay Area.  These events are the result
of more than a year of research and sound preparation and are not
to be missed!

For more info, call 522.7380 or read on...



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= *PRESS RELEASE* =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL's "THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION"
  Thursday 10 November    9:00 p.m.
  Friday   11 November   12:00 a.m.
  Club Townsend, 174 King Street, San Francisco
  Tickets available at the door   21+ w/ID

"THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION" are two of the more unusual
electronic/ambient music events you'll see/hear in San Francisco in 1994.
The shows, presented by SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL (a Bay Area-based media arts
collective), feature a unique real-time spatial audio system through which
musicians, engineers, conductors, vocalists and DJs form an interwoven,
surround-sound orchestra. Anyone who heard the Mixmaster Morris/Spacetime
Continuum presentation last spring will find these to be a great follow-up.

Sound Traffic Control's audio/visual system is a 3D sound reinforcement
network that projects music and audio animation throughout the room,
creating sonic environments that stretch the boundaries beyond the THX
audio arrays used in many theaters. "Sound Traffic Control" is also a
metaphor: the "air traffic controllers" in the 3D Surround Hub pilot
airborne "musical cargo ships" from different parts of STC's "sound world"
utilizing separate/simultaneous "taxis," "takeoffs," and "landings."  The
audience members are "passengers" who roam runways intersecting the dynamic
musical trajectories.

Thursday's "THRONE OF DRONES" features the ISO-AMBIENT ORCHESTRA, a group
of instrumentalists from numerous local bands and international solo
projects whose real-time remote performance is akin to an Internet-style
virtual experience. Iso-Ambient Orchestra members include Joe Gore; Chris
Muir; Michael Belfer (Torcher); Anton Newcombe (Brian Jonestown Massacre);
and a host of others. Later on the same bill is David Darling, solo
cellist, whose evocative music provides an atmospheric melancholy. Those
familiar with his CD releases on the ECM and Hearts of Space labels should
witness his inauguration into the 3D sound field. Along with this arrives
the Acid Karaoke of Carl Stone and Chinese singer Min Xiao-Fen. Stone is
an internationally-known electronic music composer who has traveled
extensively and released many wild and whimsical works for New Albion and
other labels. His music, in combination with Xiao-Fen's exotic vocals,
should transform the event into a department-store frenzy. DJs for the
night are not your usual fare: ethnic/world specialist Cheb i Sabbah will
create a multilayered tribal/space mix; Jonah Sharpe is back from England
with a fresh new collection of tracks; and debuting the "digital
transport" will be the creator, co-ordinator and curator of Sound Traffic
Control, Naut Humon. The 'Drones begin at 9 p.m. and tickets are $6.

Friday's RE-IMMERSION, presented in conjunction with Ambient Jungle, adds a
festive element to the occasion. Appearing with STC will be Spacetime
Continuum, a techno-ambient convergence from the Astralwerks label guided
by Jonah Sharpe, whose aural exploits include collaborations with Bill
Laswell, Peter Namlook and Deep Space Network. The evening's lift-off will
be provided by Reflective Records' Single Cell Orchestra, who explore the
mysterious underside of the ambient phenomenon through chromatic
transpositions and narrative form. For those who continue to dance, DJs
Mark Farina, Thomas and Felix will spin atypical house and techno beats in
the Dubzone. Macross Vision by Hyperdelic will fill the Dubzone with
synaesthetic color and light. Doors open at midnight and tickets are $10.

On both nights, the 3D sonic habitat will be punctuated by Perry Hoberman's
"Symphonic Appliance System," which animates a garage-sale full of
household gadgets including projectors, radios, records and electric tools
in an atomic-age audio/visual living room setting.

The Audio Engineering Society (AES) convention for pro audio gearheads at
San Francisco's Moscone Convention Center will run concurrently with the
shows, so anyone looking for a futuristic sampling of audio technology
outside the convention site need look no further. Sound Traffic Control
uses a Level Control System (from LCS, Inc.) that sends multiple Macintosh
digital audio workstation outputs live to discreet DSP mixer posts in
conjuction with other digital signal processors all of which are then
forwarded to a 3D loudspeaker diffusion matrix.

For more information, please call Sound Traffic Control at (415) 522.7380

delete this message now.....


ok, now you who are still with me:  :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) 

regarding the SF Chron & Exam strike, I think it's the best thing to happen
to SF in a little while.  Well jobs may be lost, but if you're still looking 
at the meaning of "progress" as creating more employment, then you may not 
agree.  

The following material is in no way new or original and may already be common
knowledge but I shall rehash and cut & paste what has already been going 
around for years for your reading pleasure.

why look at the local nightly news and/or newspapers and buy all the programing
about crime, weapons, drugs, law enforcement, and courtroom verdicts?

one may realise by now that a nation that *hates* crime will not bring peace &
tranquility.  A nation that loves peace and tranquillity will bring peace &
tranquillity.

one may find that the major newspapers and most of the major news programs are
just trying to get *you* to hate violence and thus suscribe to it's eventual
manifestation.  Yes folks, I feel they are the spreaders of the very stuff they
so "negatively" report.  Ever wonder why crime 'ain't going down' despite 
increasing coverage plus more & more laws reducing the rights of John and Jane
Doe (uncle Sam's nieces and nephews)?

who wins when no paper comes out:
-the brainwashed newspaper readers who depend upon it as a major source of 
 what to think & talk about.  the readers who blindly believe *everything* 
 any of the article writers decide to talk about on the paper that day. 
 Sure, the newspaper is a source of info. some of it potentially valuable, 
 but it's also just as much a source of programming.  Please read and believe
 at your own risk, if you don't already.  (This is not necessarily a "win")
-the trees grow-ing in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, Canada) 
 whose bodies become the SF chron & exam.
-those who wish to see a reduction in sensationalistic, gut-wreching, 
 heart-string-pulling (sob) crime and accident reporting.
-others I failed to mention, he he he

who loses when no paper comes out:
-the big retailers like Macy's and I Magnim, etc. who *heavily* advertise in
 the paper to boost their holiday earnings.
-any employees who are barely making ends meet in the rent/food/expenses money
 game.
-the few employees who are making a bundle and now stand to possibly no longer 
 make such a bundle.
-the leaders in "public opinion" who lead by writing, "according to a poll we
 conducted (but we ain't telling who financed our researches) 60% of Americans
 are __________."
-others I failed to mention, he he he

I personally, am not for nor against the paper but merely want to point out
these points.  I empathise with all those who stand to lose from a strike.
Don't get me wrong.  I love Herb Caen and the temperature lows & highs (though
I have found those inaccurate/generalizing the SF microclimates, too) and 
sometimes when a paper is lying around, you may even catch me reading it with
consuming interest.  But I, like all other newspaper readers am reading it at
my own risk.  I have yet to read a newspaper that contains an article 
criticizing it's own newspaper company.

Nice party. Really wonderful vibe. Met tons of new people :).  Most of
the music wasn't my groove, really, but I thought Duran really ripped
it up for a while. And watching Markie mix is something else, really
humbling.

Things I really liked:

- Wonderful wonderful vibe. Even the people at the map point were
  really nice.

- Fantastic visuals. Lots of juicy color cycled "Acidwarp" type stuff.
  Really really well done.

- Once when I was out blowing bubbles on the tile floor, Martin came
  by and very nicely expressed his concern that it might make the
  floor slippery. I thought that was really really good of him to be
  thinking of his guests like that. 

- Very polite and unobtrusive security. Searches weren't excessive,
  and they weren't confiscating things they shouldn't like pens and
  water bottles. No flashlight searches, no bad vibe from security. A
  nice change from lots of other parties.

- Good ventilation.

Things that could have been better:

- Poor sound. At first it wasn't loud enough, then it was too loud,
  EQd totally awful. All those nice records, marred by bad sound. For
  a long time the 50 Hz resonance sounded like one of those cars that
  goes by and vibrates the whole neighborhood. Some of it at least is
  attributable to the projection screens they put in front of the
  stacks. *Anything* in front of the stacks blocks a lot of the highs,
  taking out an important element of the "punch". How does one put
  together a $20,000 sound system and not realize this? I'll never
  know.

- The phone message stated that the map point was "close by" and "only
  15 minutes away" from the site. The map point was at Wired at 2nd
  and Bryant, and the event was in a rec center right next to the
  Armory, which is right next to the zoo (near where Sloat meets the
  ocean).  Figure this in your head. It would have been nice to have a
  map point just a little closer to the site, especially considering
  the weather. A real pain in the ass for SF people, less so for East
  Bay comers.

- It would have been a good idea to spend $40 or $100 and get lots of
  bulk bottled water, pitchers, and cups, and set up a couple of
  tables in the main room. The water was a little out of the way, and
  I watched a lot of people get dehydrated. Not _required_, but it's
  something I'll consider when I look at party spaces.

maybe? :)

uh... oh yah raves,

sean and maui took me to basics and it was as sean said - it was a rave!
one thing that is on my mind and that is that progressive acid trance thing.
I often hear techno fans complain about how S.F. is such a housey town,

well...

I miss house like it used to be played big deep loud ...divas talking to 
each other, in the mix, funky groovy happy stompy..

the shit that makes you dance not just twitch and jerk

anyhow I got a jungle shipment coming in which I ordered thanks to this list
thanks to you know who you are.

I have been told you can order a salad at the gardening club.
salutations, allen@ameba

It was truely an evening of mind-blowing aural and visual delights. The
highlight for me (and many others I spoke to) was Eddie Richard's set.
"Where does one track end and the next begin?" I asked myself as Eddie laid
down a seamless mix of (mostly) new or unheard of music to San Francisco.
It began with a solid house foundation which was a springboard into an
insane realm of acid, techno and beyond. Many were left dumbstruck and
unable to keep up with him as the bpms rose to 140+ (his speed increase was
so gradual that if one didn't pay close attention it wouldn't have been
noticed). Respect to Martin, Brian and the rest of the Basics crew for
bringing a fresh perspective and vibe to all our ears.

This reminds me of when I went to Double Hit Mickey's Under Water Rave 
Adventure awhile ago.  We start in Irvine, and drive 20 minutes to the map 
point which is in Fullerton, only to buy $20 tickets and decipher the 
directions leading us back to you guessed it, Irvine.  Duh, Hello...? 
Good rave though, waterslides and everything.

What does this have to do with raving?

Well, if you replace the word "Internet" with "Scene" I think it
describes the problems involved in bringing a large number
if new people into a communal non hierarchical social organism.

I do think that the Internet is a commons, and that it faces grave challenges
from selfish people.  At the same time, I think that the word "netiqutte" and
the practice of codifying rules are both unfortunate, since in practice they
are too readily understood as authoritarian laws pretending to be something
else.  The essence of a commons lies not in static rules but in a process --
the process of getting along.  A commons always has a hard time dealing with
newcomers because the newcomers weren't part of the process that led to the
customs that were already in place when they arrived.  But that's exactly why
we should avoid treating codes of etiquette (or, worse, "ethics") as if they
were handed down by the all-wise ancients.  At the same time, we must accept
the fact that newcomers sometimes simply *are* selfish and destructive, and
that it is necessary to defend the commons against such people.  Fortunately
the net has no armies, but like any other functioning commons it does have a
much more important resource in discouraging anti-social behavior -- pressure
exerted through community opinion.  I wrote a short article on this subject
earlier this year, back when the spamming attorneys were news, that might
be of interest to some people on this list.  It includes some suggestions
about mobilizing community opinion on the net to maintain a working commons.

Yes, especially when you have zippies mailbombing a plethora of
internet sites all in the name of ravers everywhere who are pissed
off at Britain's Criminal Justice Bill.  The connection between the
internet and rave communities is no longer just metaphorical.

Hmm that's funny, Cool World was always the party that most reminded me of
a high school dance...

Not so Basics! (Though the basketball hoops definitely were reminsicent of
earlier days...)

More on Basics:

Logistics: very disappointing; had to sit outside the venue in the rain for
an hour, map point opened at 10:30, party didn't start till midnight.
Really drained my momentum....

Vibe: great!

Sound: disappointing

Visuals: synergy on 3 *huge* screens, very nice work :)

Music: end of Tony's set was amazing; chunky house from Josh, Doran stole
the show -- amazing progressive ravey set (hadn't heard one like that in a
while!); very surprised to hear Eddie playing techno: 2 Dave Clarke
records, Teste's The Wipe and more...liked the first 20 minutes of Markie's
set: weird tribally, techno, trancy shit, which then shifted gears to kind
of hip hoppy, diva housey stuff -- never really been my cup of tea, but I'm
sure allen was happy (though personally, I like to jerk and twitch! :)

All in all a nice party though!

PS: Never Forget Foam Rubber To Put Under The Decks!

Poor djs had to spin with the decks at *nose* level cos the *elevated*
platform (never did understand this!?) was unstable with no padding for the
decks..fucked up the beginning of Tony's set good and proper :(

I wouldn't agree. One just needs to go to the right parties. Or throw
them! Ask for volunteers to spin techno/acid, and you may be surprised
how many hands go up :).

keyboard tapdancers,

Basics blew my mind.  But maybe my mind was already blown.  I wanted to spend
more time in the ambinet lounge but couldn't make it off the dancefloor.  I 
finally got there at 4:30am so maybe that's why.  Every dj who played after 
4:30am made me dance like a fiend or is that dancing queen - you take your 
pick.  I'm pretty sure you saw me.  I was the tall guy who dances with 
wave-like arm motions and I was swimming all over the dancefloor.  I wanted to
stay anonymous but there were very few tall people there.  Well alright, 
well ok.....  Have a happy Monday everybody,

Space

we've just embarked on a journey far, far away.  our bbs gave 
us access to the net via TIA and Netscape.  our first 
experience with this was at YSH at Megatripolis, thnx to 
davidmin@crl.com and we were impressed; didn't think we'd have 
access to this entrance into the net anytime soon.  for anyone 
not familiar with it, its Mosaic software that allows you to 
hop thru the net and view images at the same time.  my problem 
before was i could only see a terminal screen when ftp or 
http'ing and where a picture was i got the word *image* but not 
able to see the image.  correct me if i'm wrong in my 
explanations.

anyhow, i'm looking for ftp/http sites with cool rave/techno 
related stuff.  so far i've gone thru hyperreal...lots of fun 
there...and metaverse...oooo, rave radio...so please, NLight10

If that is the case then I stand corrected.  If that is the case then it
makes me even more SAD! maybe even MAD!

I've always had a hard time understanding violence.  Yes, this may sound
really naive form my part, but I have no concept of where violence comes
from.  The basic conscience in all of us (we all have a conscience, don't
we?) would dictate otherwise.  To hit someone on the head, to hurt, to
destroy...does not feel like a *natural* behavior to me.

Violence, where does it come from???......but mostly **WHY**.

Is it jealousy?
Is it a feeling of not belonging?
Is it insecurity with oneself?
Is it ignorance...not being able to communicate?
Is it a total lack of respect?
Is it selfishness?
Is it fear?
Is it a lack of LOVE?

There has to be an answer, there has to be a solution.
Where is that "magic wand" when I need it?  That would be an easy solution.
But seriously, there has got to be a solution!
I do beleive that that this violent behavior starts at a real young age.  I
think the focus should be on the children. (Once the apple is rotten it is
too late to bring it back but if that apple is nutured from the seed up, it
will grow healthy and beautiful from the core to the skin).

Simplistic? Maybe. I am a dreamer by nature and at times I dream of a
peaceful non violent world.  Dreams do come true....?..?.? no?

Love/peace/and hopefully a happy smile

I did check out the Map point 'cause I was hoping to walk to the party from
there.  But when I heard it was near the Zoo I chimped out.  Me no drive in
rain when possibly intoxed.

Well I don't like the diva stuff much either (I can tolerate diva's at the
Opera but not much on the dance floor) probably because of the pitch in the
voice.  So what do I end up doing...walk to club Universe for...deep housey
DIVA galore.  Talk about contradiction.  Well I tranced and tried to forget
about the screaching vocals.

I like that "jerk and twitch!" expression.  It describes my favorite way of
dancing too.  It is so much more expressive.  I can feel the energy just
reading those 2 words.  By the way Ethan: "Where are you spinning next for
that jerk and twitch fix?"

I'll e-mail you my bookmarks.  You can also go to an approriate newsgroup, 
then, if someone mentions an http site, it will be highlighted and you 
can go directly from the news article!  Too bad Netscape doesn't read 
mail.  If you get bored waiting for the 
newsgroup to load, remember, you can open another Netscape screen and do 
something else.

I agree that the map point was rather far from the party,
but if that and the rain help establish the crowd as a group
of people who are all dedicated to the rave, it was worth it.
I really loved this crowd and the vibe as everyone seemed so
into it.  Lots of hootin and hollerin and screamin and much
more whistle blowin than I've heard in a long time.
And the visuals were very nice, although I could've really
used some more hypnotic lighting, beyond the occasional strobe
flashes.
The ambient room was very well done, I thought.  It was
nice to have so much space to relax with friends.
Let's see,  
-really good security (friendly, calm searches)
-$1 bottled water, free cups of ice water
-sound did need help, too quiet, then imbalanced,
 perhaps additional speakers on the other side of the room
 would've surrounded the place and crowd with sound better.
-at the beginning I did have a strong "high school dance" association, but 
 as the crowd grew and I got into it I either didn't mind or didn't care.
-My most memorable moment and highlight of the evening was the last
 two songs... right as we were leaving a great song sucked us all
 onto the floor and everyone just got very excited and everybody
 was cheering and dancing like mad, and the sun had risen and the
 place was all light, and it was just such a beautiful moment.
 And then everyone made a big circle and there was just a really nice
 feeling in the air.  It was also nice to see such a large portion
 of the crowd stay until the very end.

I'd definately do it again...

now... back to midterms.

Job preservation
Basics in the city

thankfully my life isn't *that* dramatic

Security was exceptional.
Sound, space, ice water, visuals were
all first class (as expected for the money).
The ambient room was big and soft.
The main room had both sweaty/crowded
and ventilated/spacious areas.

**** people 

'a community', I guess 
there were lots of people who I have
seen at lots of different parties
'a school dance' is an interesting observation
that is my take on the F&F parties (for example) more 
than this Basics - we were in a gym, though ...

It was a friendly party with lots of smiles
Is it my imagination or did it seem like a lot
of the younger folks did a lot of lounging around?
I liked the 'saturday night out in the city' element
at the party.  Nice contrast to the e-me into outerspace
while we hold hands types.  Transport me baby, its like
this is *another world*.  I realized my wardrobe is sorely
lacking a black leather biker hat.  Community! ;)

***** people dancing 

it was pretty good
saw some of my favorite folks
but it only came together a few times
i've seen greater energy cohesion
honestly, i was surprised 

I woulda called the music trance
I didn't hear any stompy house (too bad)
Evil Eddie demonically cranked the bpms
until upper body gyrations were all I could muster

****** people (with computers)

I met Kathryn and Sean and some of their friends
and a bunch of other people also.  Superfun!

When I first started buying vinyl again after selling my collection for drugs
I was really attracted to the progressive trance hits on R&S and sabres 
of Paradise. after mixing for a while I found it was hard to be creative 
in mixing these tracks. Now I seek less dense house/techno /ambient for 
my mixing pleasure, - mixing changed my tastes! 

I realize that the gay clubs are playing the kind of house I like but my 
ultimate fantasy is a mixed scene and I like to be on psycedelic drugs 
and know my dj is in touch with my psycedelic needs. I know this party 
will happen again and again so I'm not complaining

on the other hand Alex played som detroit techno that almost made me wet 
my pants. Eighth house people remember to flyer AMEBA on the weekend so 
people can dig an alternative to Spundaes.

Regarding the Frazer Clark mention at the Planetary Mass as If he is some 
kind of hippy/techno/spiritual/rave SAINT big brother... could we have 
another volunteer or do I need to get a MAO sized picture of him on horse 
back with the laptop and hang it at AMEBA,   salutations, allen@ameba

Yeah, they lost the Troc, I don't know where they're going next.  Their 
number is 281-KNOW.  Last Saturday, they joined a book release party for 
Tim Leary at Club 181.  I'm happy, Dr. Tim  sent a message to 
the President using my computer! The message was about the Criminal 
justice bill, see David Dei's posts for more info.  Here's a URL I found 
to access info about the CJ Bill:  

http://www.bath.ac.uk/~bs2ajs/CJ.Bill.html 

The Zippies had a sound system set up in the back of the club.  The club 
itself is a typical nightclub, but the space in the back was a Turkish 
cafe place set up as a jungle (or something).  Pretty nice, but I split 
after the club made me tear down my computer at 11 (I was in a room 
between the main club and the Megatripolis lounge).  I doubt that they'll 
be back at 181, and that'll be fine with me.

Regarding  A.Child's holding his breath on the paper strike:

Mijo! I agree on most points, I only read the guardian, even then with a
few puffs and "fuck yous".  And of course, some voyueristic thrills reading
the personals:"Single, sexy, early 20's, hairy, ENDOWED, will service your
pets. Leather/vinyl a plus. Serious, only"

I really hope for the age of e-mags, I would love to subscribe to the big G
on email, some scientific journals already do it, and come out that much
faster and cheaper. Kind hard to take to the loo, and less fun to browse,
but teknologee can fix all that.

Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee...

Mijo, as a devotee of the ephemeral globes, let me rush to your
defense:BUBBLES CANNOT MAKE YOU SLIP! unless someone drops the whole soapy
mess onto one spot, but you looked like you were in control. The amount
that one bubble carries is so small that, well, you got the point...

I mean, I don't blow 'em in anyone's face, and I try to keep moving. Once,
at Organics, after its being busted and moved to the Haze (hays?), some
little tuff came up from ACROSS the floor and informed me "you keep blowing
those things and I'll break your kneecaps!" the fact that I still can hop
attests to my compliance. Someone else sed his shirt would be stained (by
my SOAP bubbles?)! Anal retentiveness, hmm, I'll cary some prune bars and
hand 'em out...
                      To everyone who blew, tenku!

I wonder if Lawrence Welk had the same problems? "Turn on the bubble
machine, Bob! Everybody SWING!"

Lotsa love,

Mijos, Basics burst my bubble! 
But, some posts have made me itchy:

-a gym does not make the high school maketh! I loved the space! It was a
center for "handicapped" children, and it's great to know that some of my
15 went to them, and not some greasy sweat-box owner. Plus the Dr. Seuss
fish on the office windows, what a way to end a fry!

-map points are not a downer to me, I feel it screens the "cruisers", since
it's that extra step you have to take, and a car full of testosterone soon
ends up in discord and at the SoundFactory, when confronted with this minor
discomfort. Fact is, I only saw 3 Lost Boyz all night, great for  little
me!

Now, not too expensive, and free water, what can I say? And the vibe as
sweet as a ripe persimmon! Plus I got to meet (and hug) new people!
Everyone smiling, some laughing (at my tight pink pants? pack dat butt!)
lots of cheers, and dave's wonderful wistle!

Smoke free chill room must mean you don't have to pay to light up. It was
that way up till 2 or so, but I guess that's impossible without obnox
inrorcement, and force is so unwelcome....visuals and bags were perfect,
coatcheck so welcome

And security was just that. Very secure and low profile, kept out of our
way, even liked my bee. Lyon's is the crew!

Not commercial, pero mui professional! Martin, u deliver!


Lotsa love,

I got to meet some great sfravers, too:

Maui
Sean 
Todd
Ethan

You are all really wonderful people!  The vibe at  Basics was good the 
minute I walked thru the door.  I got to cuddle with Milton's stuffed 
puppy dog all night long. Thanx Mil!
   Tony, as usual, spun a killer set. I just wish he was on later than he 
was.  I didn't get much out of Josh's set.  He didn't work the crowd like 
Tony did.  That is just my opinion.  Then Doran came on...OMIGOD he is 
sooo good!!  I was peaking when he started and I danced non stop his 
whole set.  I asked him later on how come I never saw him playing many 
parties and he said that no one has asked.  Jaysus, I dunno why - he is 
*so* good!!!!!
  After Doran, my legs couldn't hold out anymore, so I chilled the rest 
of the evening in the ambient room.  I heard that Evil Eddie of England 
was playing some extrodinary FAST stuff that people found difficult to 
dance to.  
    All in all, it was a GR-8 rave!!! Can't wait to go again!:):):):)
Luv to all,
Amy

If you decide you don't like IRC because of it's slowness, the
fact that there are zillions of channels, too many complex commands,
and lots of very rude people, check out Vrave, the Virtual Rave.  This
is a chat site set up and maintained by ravers for the on-line raving
community.  You can get there by doing

        telnet hyperreal.com 7283 

(7283 spells rave on a telephone keypad).

We get rude people there, too, sometimes, but we deal with them :-).

To log in for the first time, type new and follow the directions.

Although I'm very sad that a very neat trance party has died, I'm not
suprised that MegaTripolis is gone.  I got the impression (and I worked
there one weekend) that the Zippies (i.e. Frazer Clark) just sort of
started it up and then disappeared.  

I recall that the first weekend there were all these people with English
accents running around, and then I never saw them there again.  I 
assumed they were connected with Clark and the Zippies, and felt like 
they abandoned the party.  Maybe with their help it would have grown and
lasted a bit longer -- this town seems historically anti-trance, so you
just can't start up a non-house-focused party and expect it to take
care of itself week in and week out.

Oh well.  

Laura

P.S. By "anti-trance" above I mean the TECHNO side of things.  I can't
back up to correct this because my connection is weird and so is my editor.

Okay, I think it's fixed.

Apologies for having been mostly incommunicado for a week or so there - I 
basically didn't even log into hyperreal for a week, and I came back to 
about 2000 messages.  Things are better now - I have about 300 personal 
emails to respond to, so I'll get to everything eventually :)  Thanks for 
your patience....

Hey SFravers!

I experienced something magical tonight that I thought some of you might
want to hear.  My brother and his girlfriend and her 2 little boys came to
visit me.  The boys are adorable, but at that age where they're a little
rowdy. (3 and 5 yrs old.)  Well we couldn't get them to stop screaming so we
decided to all go to my room and "look at the stars" (I have glow in the
dark stars on my ceiling; something everyone should have.)  I put on some
ambient stuff and they quieted down instantly and became quite pleasant.

Then I turned on the X-mas lights I have on my wall and they became even
more enthralled.  The music picked up and they started dancing.  I gave them
each a flashlight and they started flashing them everywhere.  They were
dancing and laughing and shining their flashlights all over the place along
with the X-mas lights and the glow in the dark stars.  It was beautiful!  A
mini-rave for toddlers.  What's more, these kids have probably never even
heard this music before.  (They live in the country.)  Talk about the
psychological effects of music!!!  It gave me a lot of hope for the future
of humanity.  Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I've been very pessimistic lately
(not enough raving:) and this really seemed to give me a boost.  Maybe it
will give you one too!

Also, driving home from the store tonight.  I had to stop my car suddenly... 
There were four baby deer in the road caught in my headlights.  After
getting over the shock of having a large man-machine nearly striking them
down, they scattered off.  At first I felt bad.  What if I had hit them?
They had scattered in different directions, what if they don't find each
other?  Then I decided to give them a little more credit, and trust that
they could find each other.  I then also became glad that it was me who came
upon them instead of some speed racer who would have definitely wiped them
all out.  I'm glad these deer will live another day to escape mankind who
closes in each day claiming more of the land that should be theirs.  I say
this because I live in an area that is surrounded by greenbelt that is
supposed to be wildlife preserve, but legislation has just been passed to
develop much of this land...makes me want to scream at the society I live
in.  But if only these toddler-ravers can grow up apreciating the land they
land they live on instead of taking joy in conquering it, this planet may
still have a chance.

I realize a lot of this ideology has all been said before, but it seems
like lots of times people get so caught up in the idealism, that they forget
what's really important about life.  Of course, most of you already know
this.  Rave on, live on, love on, don't stop no matter what you do.  And
don't forget the toddler-ravers and the deer in the road...

vibrating at the speed of love----->

I said they didn't have very readibly available water, and I was
wrong. Apparently they were giving out icewater, I just missed it.
Sorry about that.

(Lesson learned: I think I'll make a sign at parties I work on so
people  will find it even if really spaced out.)

This post goes out to all who are interested in buying Technics 1200's. A 
friend of mine in Sacramento knows of a mobile DJ company that is has 
gone digital and is selling their turntables.  If you are interested 
please email me personally and I will give you the phone number.  

dhouse 

PS- You will probably have to go to Sacramento to pick them up. I believe 
the price is $400 to 450- for a pair.  Good Deal.

I certainly hope Cairo (sp? i have no idea) will carry it on. It was a
nicely done party with a good positive vibe. Definitely a good thing
and worth doing again.

Watch alt.rave and sfraves.  Put wanted ads in alt.rave too, as well
as Usenet wanted or forsale groups.  Every once in a long while, Black
Market Music gets a 1200 in, and it probably is sold before ever being
put on the floor. Good luck with getting them used. They're hard to
pry from people; maybe find a DJ really badly needing rent...

A good bet would be buying new ones at Uncle Ralph's in Berkeley. They
deal, and if you're willing to work at it, you can probably get up to
$40-60 off the street price of $400 (sometimes $380). If you buy a
mixer and cartridges at the same time, you can probably get a better
deal. One thing to ask is "Well if you can't give me the turntables
for this, how about cutting this much off the cartridges?" Worked for
me :). Wait for a sale, too.

Tell your friend to persist! Never can have enough new talent!

sorry this is a tad late but every election i always try to make a ravers 
guide to the ballot...but this time there aren't many issues i can relate 
to raves...

dammm i can't remember how the sups voted on the curfew law...but you 
should keep that in mind when voting for em...

181 i would say yes...cuz we need more public transit to raves...and 
besides that means more abandoned train tracks for us to dance on....
*how about a supertrain to la...so i won't miss orbital? * ahaha

184 is a big no cuz it is the three strikes crap...and we know they are 
going to put away people for drug usage...

185 i would say yes too...also cuz we should pay a hefty fee *tax* for 
using gas...and the money would go to parks and public transit (see above)

186 i would say a yes...look at all the borks (burned out raver kids) on 
haight or market that need health insurance

187 is a NO it is just racist crap...and ravers don't tolerate stuff like 
that...also we let everyone come to our parties...

yes on b and c cuz i can only dream about having parties in the old main 
library or city hall....

yes on H cuz domestic partners are cool

yes on j cuz i like the independant...and i hate this bullshit strike

no on m cuz i like borks hanging out on haight street...and i like to sit 
on the street tooo...

yes on R cuz the youth of sf need to get rid of this curfew bullshit

so these are just a few of my own thoughts...but i will share with you 
the most important  .... GO AND VOTE TODAY....

If anyone does buy decks here in Sac, I'll be happy to drive them to a
new home in SF. I'm there just about every weekend. 

If you do head up this way to shop for gear, let me know. We'll make a
party of it. :)

As many of you may already know, we like to view sfr as something more than
just a group of nerds with terminals. It has been and continues to be our
belief that sfr is, in fact, a real live *community*. We take a great deal
of pride and a great deal of pleasure in being part of this community. That
sfr and raving in general be a continuing source of love, of life, of
meaning, of positive community is of paramount importance to us both.
Towards this end we do our best to help organize and support the meaningful
exercise of this community (: we like to party :) The most recent
manifestation of our efforts in these directions is "Friends & Family."

>From the get go we've tried to make F&F a party that relied on sfr for both
talent and the many other forms of participation that are so essential to
that magical, spontaneous manifestaion of peacful positive energy that we
call a rave. It's been really exciting to see this actually working!
Friends & Family has been going off; and it's been going off cos all of
you have been coming down and *making it happen*. We'd like to try and take
this one step further by not only inviting you *to* the next party, but by
inviting you to help *create* the next party.

So, there will be a Friends & Family organizational & general planning
meeting at Komotion (in SF at 2779 16th St. @ Folsom) on Saturday, November
12th at 3pm. Anyone who would like to be a DJ, performer, light person,
door person, flyer-giver-outer, magician, dancer, organizer, and whatever
else [i.e. everyone who would like to take an active role in putting on the
next event] is invited to join us.

Topics we'd like to discuss include:

Space organization
DJ roster
Clean Up before the party
Set Up
Tear Down
Lights, action, taping, camera
Anything *you'd* like to discuss

We feel that it's important that ALL would be contributors come to the
organizational meeting, for several reasons:

First and foremost, we've found that those who put the most energy into
planning for an event also have the most energy to give to performance.

Second, we get a lot of requests to particpate from the entire rave
community, and are even getting requests from around the continent! So
meetings like this are one way of determining the true extent of a
performer's commitment to the event.

Third, we have found that sharing our philosophy and work face to face with
folks helps us build a mutual understanding that is invaluable in pulling
off an event; if we all understand what our mutual goals are, we can take
care of things more quickly -- before, during and after the event.  While
sharing email and phone conversations goes a long way toward these goals,
there's nothing like face to face meetings to establish and maintain
high-bandwidth communications among the contributors. We also feel that
sharing the same information and attitudes simultaneously with everyone
involved increases everyone's understanding and reduces the probability of
misunderstanding.

We would prefer to work as facilitators rather than dictators; organizers
rather than bosses, friends rather than distant patriarchs.  We prefer to
help set the matrix for other people to work in, rather than filling in all
the details.  Maximum participation is our goal; we feel there is a direct
connection between people ~doing~ and the satisfaction they feel with an
event.  We hope you share these beliefs.

However, regardless of your beliefs, we would like to invite you to share
your thoughts, ideas, and energy with us and the ever-evolving Friends and
Family crew. Hopefully in so doing, we'll all throw some really great
parties :)

We look forward to seeing you.
bryce and ethan

Thanks for getting my "facts" straight.  I guess it has gone through
some changes, I believe when it was founded it was founded by "mostly"
christian vegitarians.  I'm glad that it's still going on.

You sound like such a positive and terrific person.  I had a HUGE smile 
on my face after reading your post:):):):):):):):):)
You were right on about everything you said about little children and 
little deer.  Kids are so impressionable and music is something nobody is

differently, because they come from a pure and innocent standpoint, so 
really little kids are the best ravers of all!! I know I want to bring my

Thanx for the positive vibe!:)

Hello!

The other day, my 2 year old daughter and I were  walking down Broadway 
(the Seattle equivilant to Haight/Castro/Market street) and while we were 
walking in front of a record shop (Orpheum) she *ran* inside and started 
dancing and running in circles while yelling "Fat beat, daddy! Fat 
beat!!".

So...I kinda had to go in and dance with her. The guy who was spinning 
though that this was pretty cute, too, and tossed on some deep trance 
stuff and we danced like fools...until she decided that playing with the CDs 
looked like more fun than dancing. A hasty exit was made.

She spins at Dead shows, too!

Well,  thats not actually true...   In talking with David Dai,  and
Frazer,   they had a falling out with the Troc people,  and are looking
for a better venue...   They will NOT be happening this week,   but 
might be happening the following week.

And lets not forget to vote NO on 188....  Thats the proposition supported
by the tobacco companies that replaces local stricter smoking laws with 
more lenient state laws.

Gotta go down and vote now....

Later...

Unless, of course, you happen to support more lenient state smoking laws.

...and I know how to use them! To everyone who enjoyed themselves at
Basics, a big, wet, messy kiss! Loved meeting "little d" David the whistle
fiend, your friend Mike, maui(wowee!) and re-meat:earth child, katherine
the great,Tom, Amy, Troy and Mark, there new friend-"I dropped an hour
ago"-John,  Andrew and Cathy (the energy couple) and there crew of loved
ones, D.Faust in our house, Sun (da sun!), Brian and Andrew (the bristle
haired bubbles of joy, manning the concession stand), and so many happy,
bubbly ones....
  Mark's peace chain sez: "Imani" sanskrit for peace, read it slow: "I'm on
E" so many people got the point that night......in truth, a peaceful,
loving night, and I saw so few people blown out of there minds and staring
into space, most were dancing, or lost in that puppy pile(the ambient
room). Even security was laughin their asses off (what the hell ARE you
wearing?!? Is zat a bee?!).   
                               Purrfect!

This saturday, choices, choices. Wicked or diverse city? The latter is an
all "G" night: Graeme, Galen, Goa Gill.....I missed the first megatrip, so
I haven't seen Goa (or heard him) since the jupiter bash (where he played a
6 hour set?!?!). He's really got some beautiful energy, or was it just that
I wuz in the mood that night? 5 mangos for them three seems like a bargain
to me! 
 But then, I haven't heard Thomas in months, and man, he looks like Shaggy
when I fry (scooby-doo, where are yooouuuu?). He really gets my rocks
off.....guess it all depends on the location.....hope to get more manic
hugz from you all, maybe a massive presence of us at the thurs/fri ambient
digz at king?

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee...............

This is pretty much exclusive to the U.S., since Michael

early to what Europe has tapped into, because not only is it slamming 
in the clubs there, but its proven to be amazingly popular here.

Take I80 East to Sacramento 
Take the Business 80 Interchange once in Sacramento

I believe that I may have instigated a massive theological upheaval, in
these last few weeks, in the invertebrate community that resides around my
house. 

 The cold, so recent, has driven ants all over the bay area indoors, in
search of warmth and food,and now, dryness. You have all seen this, too.
BUT, in my case, an upheaval of their world has ocurred! First, they found
my opened packs of poprocks from come/unity and basics. As they took the
"um!Sweets!" back to their cozy home, imagine their dismay as their food
exploded, perhaps even upon their altar to Antarius! 
 "He has rejected our offering, and now all our food will explode!"
Their high priest knew what to do, and consulted with his brothers and
priestesses, and told the Queen: "we must move! Away! away from this unholy
house, its thick carpet and unwelcome food! Now! Antarius welcomes us no
more! Oh, calamity!"

 The queen, of course, knew thru her scouts of a  gentle, humid land, where
nests would be warm, their larvae would not shiver in their nest. And so it
was, they set up their new kingdom on the edge of my hot tub. There, they
found warmth in the chlorinated vapours of the goddess of bubbles,
Jah-Cu-zi, and so to appease her, as they had failed to do to Antarius,
they thanked her for her warmth by sacrificing their their young, and
returning their dead to the Great Misty Void. I can hear the drums and
bells as yet another virgin  is tossed into the heated pool, and a funereal
procession, leading the dead to the pool, thus assuring them yet another
night of comfort and survival.

My landlord,with a net and a new filter, blames it all on a bad can of raid
and some pepsi left out overnight. Poor, uninformed man.......


Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....

Well, Im really kinda bored and couldn't think of anything much important 
to post here, so here's this leaflet that I was once given at a rave. 
It's kinda neat:

      PARAVOID
The Most Powerful Vibrations
Are Those That Are Shared
The Most Powerful Emotions 
Are Those That Are Bared
The Most Powerful Heroes 
Are Those Who Will Dare
The Most Powerful Rulers
Too Often Dont Care

Hmmmmmmmmmm, just something to think about.


HAPPINESS IS BEING AMONG FRIENDS

Please ignore my previous post about the turntables.  I get my mail out of
order and didn't realize until now that this was a private party selling
these.  Ah, but at least we can dream about a world where everyone can get a
pair of 1200's  for $400!

Basically, the guys at the Troc want a $1,000 bar guarantee, no matter what.

They were certainly nice when they spoke with us about possibly doing YSH 
there occasionally, but they really have a bottom line that they require. 
And, as we all know, that ain't gonna happen with our crowd....

Can't think of much to add to what's already been said about this party, 
so I'll just send out a heartfelt thanks to those who were involved as 
dancers, huggers, smilers, organizers, spinners, puppy-pilers (to 
borrow Milton's turn of phrase), bubble-blowers, whatevers. You're all 
wonderful!

I found on the dancefloor a strand of silver beads. It's about 4" in 
diameter, and I think it's meant to be a bracelet - there's no clasp.  If 
it belongs to you or yours, email me directly, and I'll arrange to get it 
back to you.

:)
Kathryn

Hey, have you all heard of DMX, the Digital Music Express.  Its 30 channels
of digitally encoded music that comes in over cable.  Anyway, Viacom
carries it and it costs $10 a month (a little steep).  I'm mentioning it
because it features a "Dance" channel that 70% of the time is housy techno.
Sometimes I've heard some acid and trance.  No commercials and the remote
for the decoder box has a display that tells you the name of the song, the
record and even the Cd catalog number.   The stuff isn't mixed and
sometimes the song order is a little shocking (techno, techno, madonna,
techno, techno, wierd kd lang dance mix).  I understand that the director
for that channel loads 100 cd's up, tags the songs he wants to have played
and how frequently and the computer does the rest.  Every once in a while
the computer accidentally beat matches something and ti blows me away.  For
some reason it gets particularly good around midnight because all the song
counters get reset on the computer.

anyway, I just wanted to tell everyone about it in case someone wants to
know where they can get 24 hours of house. I'm really happy with it.  

Purple Tiger

Yeah, me too!  I subscribed to this list a week ago out of homesickness 
(i'm stranded on the east coast until next month) and since then i've met 
some really awesome people, bumped into people i know, and kept in touch 
with the warmth and awesome energy of the bay area scene--almost like 
being at a rave! =)  see you all in December!  love,  jessica

	This election is not going well...I'm majorly bummed!!!   :(
Wilson is in for another 4 years.  
187 looks like it is going to pass as well...
Basically all the suggestions that Susie gave us are not coming true...
About 27% of the precincts have reported in at about 11:30.

See Ya,

Thursday night is 9-4
Friday night is midnight-6

The King St. Garage will be done up audio - wise more than anything
else, with a 13-speaker array, each speaker getting a separate sound
source... and loftiness is a necessity for true 3-D sound - that
means up & down too!  In terms of decor, the space will be done up in
50's living-room style, with couches and TV sets, to accompany in theme
Perry Hoberman's Symphonic Appliance System; Perry triggers vintage blenders,
toasters, drills, vibrators, etc. with a Midi keyboard...

Friday night the Townsend St. side will be open too, but you still enter 
from King St.  

byo water, earplugs, pillows.

Hello all y'all-
     I'm a Southern California native who loves to groove in the "after 
hours" scene.  Unfortunately, the "vibe" down here isn't as positive as I 
would like it to be.  I've heard only positive things about the scene in 
the "city" (San Francisco) and I'm going to travel up north this weekend. 
	Any suggestions, send them to csp94@netcom.com; My name is Johnny 
and I'm borrowing my roommates account.  Hope to meet some of you this 
weekend.

Johnny-"Fresh Grooves, Phunky Rhythm, DEEP HOUSE..."

Subject: Chicago Raves!!-An SFraver's Travel Log-(Long)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hi All,


I went! I found!! I raved!!! (Wed.)  I flew in to O'Hare airport. Then,
checked in at the Hyatt House. Now, safely located, I walked down and asked
at the front desk, where 2660 N. Clark street was, (home to Gramaphone
Records). I took a cross-town bus, and in less than half-hour I was there!!!
 A Mecca around the world to House, Progressive, and Deep House music in
Chicago, Illinois.

Inside, there were records everywhere, people standing at bins poring over
records, and a Dj spinning records in the back. I walked back, introduced
myself to Dj Josh Werner. He told me he had spun at 1015 Folsum last year,
and had heard Garth and Jeno at the New Music Seminars in New York.  I knew I
was in!!! I traded him a Jeno tape I had brought to trade, and he gave me a
tape called "Variant Music."

I then explained I wanted to buy some records for dj Rick Preston, especially
Chicago labels of Progressive and Deep House. He said, " great, I'll get some
new releases,
I'll que them up, play the grooves, if you don't like it say next, if you
want it, just say tell me and we'll go to the next record."

I was nervous at first, but realized when I heard something I liked, I wanted
to dance.
So, I used that method to buy new releases from Paul Johnson, Derrick
Carter,Etc.

I a few dj tapes; Freddie Bain's "The Real Shit" session #3--and Lil' John's
"Mo House
#5"--Both are kick ass club sets. I also got as many flyers as they would let
me have, so
(Fritz@hook.com)--Greg & Nancy, never fear, I got flyers for you.

After my purchases, I asked where I should go in the city. I had decided, and
promised  my friends I wouldn't attempt any warehouse or big Raves by myself.
There was a big party, a make-up party for a party that had been busted
before, headlining Josh Wink
from Philly who was at our Phutur party) Paul Johnson, and more. But, I
couldn't have gotten there by cab anyway.

Josh told me to go to the "Rivera," "The Red Dog," and "The Warehouse."

I went back to the hotel, had dinner. And got dressed, hailed a cab, and went
off to the North side, the New Town district near Wrigley field. The cab
driver told me it could be dangerous late at night, and that I shouldn't take
the buses or the "L" train back to downtown. This made me a little jumpy;
 anew town,  and visions of Al Capone danced 
in my head. But.........onward.

The cab stopped at an intersection, and said "This is Broadway & Lawerence."
 I looked around, and at first I didn't see anything open, no people, no
Lights, a few cars. I it looked a little like the South of Market district,
but I didn't know where the hell I was. I was a bit frightened and confused.
 Then, in the dark, I saw that the name over this darkened theater was named
"Rivera." Yeah!!!!!

I walked around the corner, and saw an alley way leading behind the theater.
"I must be getting warmer, I thought."  When I saw the security guys, I knew
I had found it. As I got closer, I heard that old "Thump,Thump, Thump"
pumping out through the open door.

As some of you who know me, I am  42 years old, 6'4", grey-hair, and beard. I
 look like a refugee from some academic institution.(which I am)

The guys at the gate said, "Ah, Sir? This is a mixed party, Gay,Lesbian,
Straight--Are you sure you at the right place?" I laughed, and told them it
was cool, and went inside.

The "Rivera" is a converted theater. High ceilings, some spotlights on the
walls, and some on the floor. Interesting in that you could dance in relative
darkness, or move into a spot if you wanted. The high ceilings made for good
ventilation, and the temperature was cool, and unsmoky all night.

The dj's were perched high in what used to be the projection booth, and I
soon forgot all about them.  A pretty good sound system, not great, not bad.
I felt comfortable immediately.  I enhanced my mood a little, and began to
dance. The music was a combination of House ( a little on the discoey side)
mixed with some raging progressive instrumental stuff. Some of this gets very
close to our SF Acid House.

I gotta tell you the crowd really made the party. They really came to have a
good time.
They whooped and hollared. They did circle house dancing. The style of
dancing is
very similar--if I would say anything, it would be they are a bit more into a
hip-hop style.

As I danced, people smiled, and I talked with people. I've come to the
conclusion, that this happens, not because I a great dancer, but because I
can dance at all that surprizes people.

Anyway, something SF could learn from Chicago, is about security. The
Security guys at the Rivera had flashlights in their hands, and walked among
the dancers, and shined their lights on people who were "goin off."
 Obviously, the crowd was used to this, becuase, when the lights were shined
on people, they pretended they were on-stage. People would cheer and clap and
it was great.  It also made the security part of the party, instead of
hostile goons like they are in SF.

End of Part I---Robertj.......monterey

I found this on a newsgroup and thought it might be of 
interest...

SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL's "THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION"  
Thursday 10 November & Friday 11 November, 1994  Club Townsend, 
174 Townsend Street, San Francisco 
"THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION" are two of the more 
unusual electronic/ambient music events you'll see/hear this 
year in San Francisco. The shows, presented by SOUND TRAFFIC 
CONTROL (a Bay Area-based media arts collective), feature a 
unique real-time spatial audio system through which musicians, 
engineers, conductors, vocalists and DJs form an interwoven, 
surround-sound orchestra. Anyone who heard the Mixmaster 
Morris/Spacetime Continuum presentation last spring will find 
these to be a great follow-up. 
Sound Traffic Control's audio/visual system is a 3D sound 
reinforcement network that projects music and audio animation 
throughout the room, creating sonic environments that stretch 
the boundaries beyond the THX audio arrays used in many 
theaters. "Sound Traffic Control" is also a metaphor: the "air 
traffic controllers" in the 3D Surround Hub pilot 
airborne "musical cargo ships" from different parts of STC's 
"sound world" utilizing separate/simultaneous "taxis," 
"takeoffs," and "landings."  The audience members are 
"passengers" who roam runways intersecting the dynamic musical 
trajectories.
 
Thursday's "THRONE OF DRONES" features the ISO-AMBIENT 
ORCHESTRA, a group of instrumentalists from numerous local 
bands and international solo projects whose real-time virtual 
performance is akin to an Internet-style online experience. 
Iso-Ambient Orchestra members include: Joe Gore; Chris Muir; 
Michael Belfer (Torcher); Anton Newcombe (Brian Jonestown 
Massacre) and Larry LaLonde (Primus) and a host of others. 
Later on the same bill is David Darling, solo cellist, whose 
evocative music provides an atmospheric melancholy. Those 
familiar with his CD releases on the ECM and Hearts of Space 
labels should witness his inauguration into the 3D sound field. 
Along with this, arrives the Acid Karaoke of Carl Stone and 
oriental singer Mien Xiao-Fen. Stone is an 
internationally-known electronic music composer who has 
traveled extensively and released many wild and whimsical works 
for New Albion and other labels. His music, in combination with 
Mien Xiao Fen's exotic vocals, should transform the event into 
a department-store frenzy. DJs for the night are not your usual 
fare: ethnic/world specialist Cheb i Sabbah will create a 
multilayered tribal/space mix; Jonah Sharpe is back from 
England with a fresh new collection of tracks; and debuting on 
"digital transport" will be the creator, co-ordinator and 
curator of Sound Traffic Control, Naut Humon. The Drones begin 
at 9 p.m., tickets are $6. 
Friday's RE-IMMERSION, presented in conjunction with Ambient 
Jungle, adds a festive element to the occasion. Appearing with 
STC will be Spacetime Continuum, a techno-ambient convergence 
from the Astralwerks label guided by Jonah Sharpe, whose aural 
exploits include collaborations with Bill Laswell, Peter 
Namlook and Deep Space Network. The evening's lift-off will be 
provided by Reflective Records' Single Cell Orchestra, who 
explore the mysterious underside of the ambient phenomenon 
through chromatic transpositions and narrative form. For those 
who continue to dance, DJs Mark Farina, Thomas and Felix will 
spin atypical house- and techno-beats in the Dubzone. Macross 
Vision by Hyperdelic will fill the Dubzone with synaesthetic 
color and light. Doors open at midnight, tickets are $10. 
On both nights, the 3D sonic habitat will be punctuated by 
Perry Hoberman's "Symphonic Appliance System," which animates a 
garage-sale full of household gadgets including projectors, 
radios, records and electric tools in an audio/visual 
atomic-age setting.
 
The Audio Engineering Society (AES) convention for pro audio 
gearheads at San Francisco's Moscone Convention Center will run 
concurrently with the shows, so anyone looking for a futuristic 
sampling of audio technology outside the convention site need 
look no further. Sound Traffic Control uses a Level Control 
System from LCS, Inc. that sends multiple Macintosh digital 
audio workstation outputs live to discreet DSP mixer posts 
which are then forwarded to a 3D loudspeaker diffusion matrix.

I'd also like to recommend a new product I recently saw called
BlissPaint.  It's Mac-based, and gives you the tools for creating
your own trippy screensavers, like dazzle, etc.  You can also
"play" various parameters of the screen savers interactively via 
the keyboard, or via MIDI.  It will also take audio inputs and
respond to the amplitude variations.
 
The guy who wrote it can be reached at imaja@aol.com - his name is
Greg Jalbert, he's a one-man company, has done visuals for the Dead
and some parties.  If it ran on an intel-based machine, i would have
bought it without hesitation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ps.  One reason I'm bringing this to the attention of SFRaves is that 
Greg, besides being a nice guy, is a fellow SFRaver.  The stuff he 
does is similar to Synergy's, and his product is one of those things
that makes me say, "yes, this is the kind of thing home computers were 
meant to be used for."

See what happens when you vote. The voice of the people is heard.
Isn't America wonderful. Sorry you are unhappy.

By the way, this doesn't belong in sfraves. Political crap should be 
spewed elsewhere.

Wilson will be so busy running for president he shouldn't
have time to do much of anything.

187 will make some lawyers happy and that is about it.

Do you want the freedom to stay out late at night?

Three strikes does.

Do you want to be able to choose (gender, race) who you sleep with?
Bob Dole and Jesse Helms don't want you to.

Do you (and your partner) want reproductive freedom?
Newt Gringrich doesn't trust you with a choice.

Chances are more than one of these issues affect you or someone

Freedoms we take for granted can disappear in an instant.

It's NOT just about "big government."  
They have an agenda, and we will pay for it for the next forty years.

Just a warning.. while _I_ feel this has everything to do with raving,
you might think it's just politics..
(it's also a long emotional spew on my part :) :)

Sharif Torpis said:

i'll comment on this in a second, but first...

> By the way, this doesn't belong in sfraves. Political crap should be 
> spewed elsewhere.

actually i think "political crap" has been a  part of
sfraves since its birth... i can remember lots of political
issues being brought up (and arguements about whether or 
not they should be here) and i think the sense of 
community that was provided in exploring political issues
has made sfraves what it is today

i'm not saying this to discourage people from expressing their
Opinion about what belongs on sfraves or what doesnt...
just mentioning my perspective on this lists history

even if you take raves to te simple aspect of being about partying
(aside from what the UK can show about politics and partying..)

How many of the people who throw parties here aren't  legally here??
Quite a few of the people who keep our scene alive
are going to get screwed over by 187...

and Wilson.. fuck.. i really hope i wouldnt have to say
anything about wilson...

and 184.. 3 Strikes... ummm.. since there are large 
parts of the rave scene that have to do with non-legally sanctioned
things... i dunno i still see a connection

so anyhow...

I think the nausea on my part is finally starting to come down
but that's cuz i havent read the paper or watched tv
or listened to the radio or looked at a web site
(im setting up Netscape to do that as i type :)
 
But last nite i was in a pure daze...
i thought it would happen.. but somehow deep inside
had that last bit of hope
it's like when you're watching the championship game for some sport
and your favorite team is totally sunk
but you still have this little bit of hope
because you know it is POSSIBLE to shoot 5 3 pointers in 2 minutes,
(although not damn bloody likely :)

that's pretty much how i felt this past couple weeks
hoping that somehow people would come to their senses
and really pay attention to what was going on...

i dunno.. i think i'm still in a bit of shock
when Clinton got elected i really didnt think it made THAT much of 
a difference, and i'm sure many think it didn't
but it has seemed like there was a quite different feel in the air
these past couple of years than the previous twelve

someone i live with was tlaking about how it didnt matter
cuz "the revelution was starting" and well she was 
spewing off a lot of propaganda that i just stopped
correcting her on, but you know....
i was kinda thinking the same thing...

really with the passing of 187 here and teh Criminal Justice Bill
over in England...
i dunnoo... people always act like it's going to be a big
oppressive hand of government forcibly taking control...
but it's not... Hitler gained power in Germany
by moving up the political ranks just like anyone else...

People and "democratic" governments and voting for fascism
(btw... i don't think the "voice of the people" was heard...
the only people who were heard are those given a voice..
and we could debate that subject forever.. but anyhow..)

Looking at the returns.. it's easy to see that 
VOTING DOES MATTER!
The positions for Senator, Sec of State, Controller, treasurer
and Insurance Commissioner all won with a small enough margin
that had the non Dem and Rep votes been cast in a single direction
it would have changed the outcome...

but how many people went out and voted???
evne though they knew it was important?

at least in Britain there's going to be some fucking riots...
i dont really support violence, but i doubt that they
are going to let themselves be tromped on...

and i think with 187 there's some hope...
but it's going to be violent as well,
the middle class are letting themselves be pushed around,
but with some of the actions seen regarding 187 before elections
i think LA and San Diego are going to have some huge problems on their hands
especially San Diego...
and its hard for me to say that it isnt deserved..

there was just so much done that was ridiculous
and all because people really DIDNT know what they were voting for
they were (IMNSHO) tricked into thinking that 
these things would turn out in ways which they never will..
(yeah right.. we lose 2.5 billion a year to illegal aliens...
shit.. like we don't save over 10 billion using their labor..)

for nearly as long as i've been on this list, the thought of moving
to SF has been on my mind.. and seeing this little red dot
on all the voting maps indicating that it is the last bastion
of sanity in the state might reinforce that idea
but hearing about all the election returns coming in...
it really doesnt feel like this country is a very safe place to live
(kinda funny, cuz all these props and stuff are supposed to make it feel safer)

W/r/t rave radio, there's this movement/protocol/group of people using
MBONE on the internet to do live one-to-many and many-to-many video and
audio conferencing. There are some public-domain tools called 'vat' and
'nv' from Lawrence Berkeley Labs which allow this to be set up on Sun and
SGI workstations (others too perhaps) equipped w/ audio and/or video
capabilities. Note that many net-sites do not support the multicast
protocols involved, nor do many have the bandwidth. Given the networking
needs, this is pretty much relegated to geek-ville of corporate research
labs, govt labs, universities, etc.

Anyways, you can sign up for internet radio slots and broadcast shows live
over the internet. Unless the "producer" is sending audio out at phenomenal
bandwith, and you can allocate a 100kbytes/s for yourself all-the-way into
a backbone site to receive ... it'll sound like crap. The internet wasn't
made for this, and it isn't uncommon for one's transmisison to break up
based on other network activity. Anyways, I've been thinking about doing
this but remain busy w/ real work. If you've got the network connections
(e.g. a T1 into BARRNET) and an SGI Indy or Sun SPARC, and no lame-ass
corporate MIS types fucking w/ your network connectivity, you're good to
go... Probably more work than "fun" once the novelty of transmitting to a
handful of other sites that happen to be listening at once. And after going
through all the work, people will still probably be requesting "Freebird"..=
.. :-)

PS: ob-selfpromotion... coming soon to an internet site near you (perhaps
free w/ restrictive non-commercial license for university and/or
government/ARPA sites) -- WWW authoring and publishing for your unix
workstation....

=09http://www.eit.com/presentations/gpware94/s1.html
=09http://www.eit.com/papers/gpware94/paper.html

This will allow you to author multimedia documents (including images and
movies) and "publish" to WWW servers on the internet that have been
equipped with "document checkin" scripts.

For example, I was computing at home, hooked up to the internet via Netcom
and TIA ... I noticed that the cat wanted some attention, so I took a few
digital snapshots, shot some video, glued it all together w/ some silly
text, issued the "publish" command, and now the cat is on the internet...

TO ALL SFR DJ'S
I've had a shortage of guest d.j's on my show as of late & was wondering
if any of you would be interested in playing. The station is KZSU,
Stanford & it runs from mid-3 Sunday nights. The name is 88ACID so that
gives you some idea of what I like dj's to play. If you play acid or
experimental house & are interested in playing please email me. 
p.s. Due to the fact that most of the time guest dj's come on they play
cheesy stuff that I hate almost as much as pop, I'm going to try switching to 
an experimental sound/noise format next quarter to express my anger at this.

FRASER ANSWERS SF Ravers
Theres so much delicious turbulence  and war fever bubbling up that ICs
(Internet Citizens)  need to at least know what we CLAIM were up to.  So,
heres a rough roundup of some negative comments and my responses.  - Fraser
Clark

Q:  Have we launched the Internet Invasion of the UK to make a fast buck?
A:  Listen, were fucking broke, man, and have been since we landed in New
York last summer.  Zippy 7 was arrested for sleeping in Golden Gate Park this
week but such stuff hasnt stopped us yet.  Were trying to Change the World on
a 2400 baud modem.  Anyone seriously into fun who wants to help the Cause
should contact us on our 281-KNOW number.

Q:  Are we cyber terrorists?  Will our strategy encourage other political
groups into bombarding us all with political junkmail?  And will such
activity give the govt an excuse to police the Internet?

A:  Hold on here!  We're not smashing anything other than mental conventions.
A million Ravers/Internet Citizens lose nearly all their democratic rights
in a next door country and some people here in the US are objecting to us
mailing them a protest PLUS a positive SOLUTION to the danger they themselves
are in!  Yes, it will lead to more political junk mail but surely the
convention is designed to prevent commercial abuse, not to prevent the
freeflow of IDEAS within the right forums.

Q:  Are we just attention seekers?
A:  Yes.  This thing is bigger than all of us.  NO APOLOGIES.

Q:  Are we jumping on a bandwagon?
A:  What bandwagon?  Were trying to create a bandwagon so YOU can jump on it
and help us ALL help ourselves. 

Q:  Have the zippies dropped pronoia?
A:  There are definitely some half baked thinkboxes out there.  What is the
Internet Invasion but a global attempt to help ourselves *behind* the backs
of the authorities? 

Q:  Has megatripolis dematerialized or just relocated?
A:  Were  hatching our next move and taking a well earned rest.  We were
advised originally by well-meaning friends to use the TROC but basically the
Trocadero werent prepared to show the commitment needed to establish
something as new as Megatripolis.  Keep up with us on our 281 KNOW number..  
LAST WORD
Listen!  We all are like Gulliver sleeping while the Lilliputian bureaucrats
and killjoys peg the hairs on our head one by one to the ground.  No single
inroad on our freedom can stop us, nor is it worth bothering about.  A
hundred couldnt stop us.  But a point is now being reached where the Human
Spirit must suddenly collect itself together and Arise before it is too late
to move.  

Perhaps the UK government has tried to pin down a whole bunch of Gullivers
hair and the pain finally awoke the Sleeping Giant?

I'm not so sure about which sfravers I missed, but I had a great time at 
Basics.  Lotsa smiles and hugs from old and new friends.  It was great to 
travel out from DC and see how much the scene is thriving in SF.  OK, so the 
sound system wasn't the best.  The music was killa, and there was a great 
vibe everywhere.

Hello to my friend Mike (and yours, too), Kathryn, Tom, Ellen, Ronnie, Jamie, 
Jim, Larry, Owen, Linda, Eric, Rhoda, Norm (next time get a non-raver 
babysitter!!!), Andrew, Danny, and everyone else.  Hope to see you all again 
soon.

Oh yeah, to those who asked and didn't get a response, I AM 44.  I left my 
wheelchair at home, so I'm not surprised you didn't know.  And yes, if you 
are lucky, you'll be raving at 44 too.  Yay!!!

Paul

> byo water, earplugs, pillows.

What's the point of going to a 3-d show if you have to wear earplugs?
I would think that earplugs would eliminate all of the 3-d-ness.

Perhaps they could just set the volume to non-ear-damaging levels.

Where's your rave mentality. Can't you have a discussion without 
insulting people. There is a limit to when something should be
moved to alt.94.election or whatever and this point has been 
reached IMHO. That's all I'm saying. I realize that rave can be tied to
almost anything but let's not stretch it. I rarely post but when I do its
because I felt I had to express myself. Please respect that. The minority is
not always wrong or clueless. You must agree w/ that.

OOOOH! Hold me down or I'll smear you with peanut butter and feed you to

 Sharif smugly defends the democratic process:
>See what happens when you vote. The voice of the people is heard.
>Isn't America wonderful. Sorry you are unhappy.

"Sorry you are unhappy" your self-centered hiney!187 is evil and unfair, we
are not disagreeing about taxes or a new transport system, this is about
right and wrong (hey, I'm quoting the George!)!
 No, amerika iz not vunderful! The voice of the people is not always the
voice of humanity, and kalifornia's voice is that of frightened,
narrow-minded, selfish, xenophobic, intolerant clansmen wearing suits
instead of hoods and carrying crosses instead of burning them. I have
learned that californians eat up all the tripe they are fed about violence
by the media, they want to pay more for less (186 down), and they really
don't want to share (187). 
Now, my last name is medeiros, but I look pretty damn white. I'll never be
asked for papers. How about your future children, SHARIF TORPIS? That's a
name that could light up a kindergarten cop's eyes "papers, please, jr."

 This crap does belong here, because sfravers do more than just get fucked

Did it ever occur that you don't have to preach to the converted. I never
once said who I voted for. All I said was that this doesn't belong here.

I'm sorry to add to the clutter, but where's YOUR rave mentality!?  
calling someone else's post "political crap" seems to fall a little short 
of "having a discussion without insulting people."

All of this has gotten out of hand.

The argument, as most of those on sfraves, seems headed for the "what 
raving is all about" schpiel.  For you to flame someone on their 
perception about what raving is, or for you to post some gigantic message 
detailing what someone else thinks raving is (and what we should all 
think raving is), is the same thing as "the powers that be" instituting 
laws and regulations that go against what you or I believe.

All of you talking about love and respect aren't respecting those who 
see it as something else.  That is quite a weak standpoint--showing 
respect for only those that agree with you.  That takes no love or 
respect.

I'm on this list to get information about raves happening in the bay 
area, live shows that come through, which events are generally worth 
attending, and which dj's are generally pretty good.  I'm not on 
this list to read cutesy feel-good messages about what grade-schoolers 
think love is or to churn through messages that have *one* line of 
non-quoted material at the end, and find that it states in no uncertain 
terms, "sheesh".

	Sami

My rave mentality is, "I'm going to this place to dance around to music I 
like."

Is it just me, or did you spend the first half of your post saying how 
important it is to respect others opinions and let people feel free to do 
what they want, and then the second half insulting other people's posts??

It's just you.  Sorry :)  I was criticizing others' posts in the context 
of their lack of relevance to this mailing list's intended purpose.

Lee, I didn't appoint myself anything. I just stated that I was unhappy
with the list's contents as you would have done if it turned to rave
cuisine or some such nonsense. And no, I'm not going to complain to 
Brian. If the list members are happy about it then *I* will leave. WHy
alter a list if its members (for the most part) are perfectly happy?

I don't think anyone should hijack the list for their own purposes or
to beat a dead horse or whatever, but it seems to me that when
important things happen in our lives we ought to feel free to talk
with our friends about them.  What happened yesterday was the biggest
change in national politics since 1980, and it continues a trend that
traces back to 1968 and 1952.  Related to raving?  Only in the sense
that what we do is inevitably at least in part a product of our political,
social and economic culture.  

Some of us who've been around since this list started, and some who've
been here for just a bit, understand that slack must be granted.  We
are among friends.  Everyone deserves to blow off steam once in a while,
so we can all reserve the right to do so when we feel the need.

It's one thing to point out that a discussion is getting off track.
It's quite another to step up on the soap box, all bent out of shape
and righteous, snapping about how this or that is off limits.  Tone
makes a big difference *because it says something important about intent*.
NOBODY orders me what to say or not to say on the Internet, dammit.
I strongly concur, however, that to make it all work we generally have
to try and stay "on subject".  But as I said, important events might
very well intrude on our limited scope of discussion.

I sure as hell don't want to see a few comments about the electios
degenerate into a flame war that consumes ten times the bandwidth and
two orders of magnitude of our patience.

And that's all I have on this channel.

Peace out,.

( I'll be discussing ideas that might seem obvious to most of you ,
  but sometimes a stating of the unstated obvious is worthwhile )
( I hope ).
Recently , Fred Huette posted some comments in reaction to the recent
heated exchanges over the political posts:
> 
> ... We are among friends.  Everyone deserves to blow off steam once in 
> a while, so we can all reserve the right to do so when we feel the need.

 I think there has developed two groups of folks who subscribe to SFRAVES.
There are folks who are mainly here for news about parties , and don't 
really want to establish any kind of friendship or acquaintance with
the other subscribers . For the sake of discussion , I will call this
group "Consumers".

 The other group has established friendships with other subscribers , and
tend to see SFRAVES as a place to share feelings and give "hugs" ( "hugs"
via jokes , special information , etc. ). Of course , this group is just
as interested as the Consumers in getting news about raves in the SF Bay
area. For the sake of discussion , I'll call this group "Pals".

( In reality , an individual subscriber would fall somewhere in the 
 spectrum from Consumer to Pal. I would place myself on the Pal end
 of the spectrum ).

 In the case where a major event of an upsetting nature occurs to a Pal ,
they would feel free to post something concerning this on SFRAVES , since
friends talk about such things with each other - especially something
political , which affects us all , voters and non-voters alike. And , since
friends share good news as well , posts of an upbeat nature also get 
posted by Pals.

 As Consumers may be in an email situation where time == money and "trash"
posts waste their time and costs them time charges , it may be understandable
that they may get impatient with posts that aren't strictly about raves
news . Sometimes , this impatience gets expressed in posts in reaction to
some non-rave thread.

 Internet newsgroups have a limited scope of discussion , by definition.
They're more efficient that way. But , SFRAVES is not a newsgroup. While
subscribers start out as Consumers , many of them become Pals. Unlike
the situation with many newsgroups , who have posters who will never meet
each other physically , the very nature of SFRAVES means that subscribers
will have multiple chances to meet each other at raves. 

 And then there's the "community of love" issue regarding raves that is a
whole 'nuther discussion in itself - I mention it as an ambient concept
that makes some folks on SFRAVES feel more open to other ravers, and 
therefore more open to other SFRAVES subscribers.

 FOR MYSELF , I would hate see SFRAVES be a cold-blooded collection of
messages about upcoming raves and rave reviews. However , there is an
option for the "hard-core" Consumers of SFRAVES - the weekly calender , 
which condenses the upcoming rave information in a nice , neat , clean
bundle. As I remember , the calender can be subscribed to seperately,
so the fluff-laden SFRAVES discussion give-and/or-take can be avoided.
Of course , all the rave reviews are on SFRAVES . 

 I haven't done an exhaustive study of the last few month's postings , but
I suspect most of the rave reviews posted on SFRAVES are by Pals . So ,
based on this totally unsupported hypothesis - maybe Consumers should
consider the occasional "fluff" thread as the "price" to pay for getting
the latest rave news rumors and rave reviews on SFRAVES. ( Even if my 
hypothesis is wrong , using the "price" concept as a working mental 
sanity saver still has merit , I think ).

 Pals should remember to limit the non-rave posts . Consumers
( and Pals ) should keep in mind that unflamed threads die faster than
flamed threads , in my experience. 


  Those are my opinions -

i read someone mention that they thought california wasn't the
  liberal haven for free ideas that they thought it wuz.

coming from Fresno as I do, (no sympathy notes, pleeze :)) i'd like
  to point out that the central valley of california is as close to
    the midwest attitudinally as you can get... SERIOUS rednecks,
      who basically would torch the entire city of SF just to stamp
        out 'perverts' if they had a chance...

there is a GOOD side to this observation, which is that ca is the ONLY
  state where you can find EVERY IMAGINABLE type of community; what we've
    seen in the elections is basically IMHO a product of mass-media hype;
      it has little to do with the overall condition of ca's peeple.
this place is the ultimate model for what the world will be like in
  the middle of the next century; all walks of life and all cultures
    must live in peace with each other in the same place if we want to go
      on, and personally, i believe things will work out and solutions
        will be found.
you just can't take a single election as a sign of a turning point,
  be it to the left or to the right.  california's future is going to
    be absolutely INCREDIBLE, just wait and see; you're living in quite
      possibly the next great NATION, not just a state; our economy, 
       even tho in a shambles right now, still ranks in the TOP TWENTY
         OF ALL NATIONS. That's JUST California.  Think about it the
          next time yer swearing at Wilson or Gingrich or (for you 
            conservatives out there) Hayden.
      ... no single one of the peeple are going to derail what's to come;
           very few of them have any inkling of what will happen.

(but i think some of YOU do)

seeya!

Part 2----SFraves----- (Chicago Travel Log)  


Someone just wrote me saying that I probably would have seen Freddie Bain or
Lil John at the "Red Dog." It is a  warehouse club at North & Damen on the
Northside of Chicago. I'm bummed, but I had a presentation to give at a
conference at 8:30am-So, I pulled in the reins on Friday night. I had had
such a great time at the Rivera, so I was feeling pretty lucky.

On Saturday Night---With all my business triumphly behind me (I was a
presenter a the national conference for the Coalition of Essential
Schools-The Coalition is a network of schools based on the reform principles
of Ted Sizer from Brown University)-- My talk was about using Technology &
Telecommunications to Teach the Humanities)  Anyway-I started off for the
Westside, for a club called "The Warehouse."

I got there at 10:30pm to find it didn't open until 11:00pm. I hung around
outside and talked to the security guys.  Again, they were cool, and a female
security guard "patted me down."

The inside of the club was an older two-story brick building. The brick on
the inside had been sand-blasted, so it had a nice upscale look to it. The
downstairs room was so dark you almost couldn't see.  But, I learned later
that this room was a kind of "love dungeon" People  pressed up against each
other along the walls, and shadowy figures undulated in the
darkness--Definately date night in the lovepit!!!!

This was the difference I felt between our scene and the Chicago House
nightclub scene. Granted, I didn't get out to the big  "NutRageous" RAve.
Nor, was I able to go to the "Red Dog." What I saw was more of a party scene,
rather than the community vibe we create at F&F, Sunset, or CU. However,
these people were very accepting, friendly, and loved to dance and party.

The music, and the dj's were outrageous. And, they pushed the dance energy
 to the extreme!!!

I didn't mention, that at Rivera, on the Northside, the party was 60% Puerto
Rican, then Hispanic, Black, Asian, then last, Caucasian. I've never felt so
much in the minority. But, I will let you know that dancing transcended any
of that. Dancing was the passport to acceptance here. Which I suspect is the
case anywhere.

"The Warehouse," was on the Westside, and was 98% black. 1% Hispanic, 1%
Caucasian,(and most of them were woman.) I was apprenhensive at first, and
wondered if I had violated some territorial taboo. I introduced myself to the
bartender, and in no time he was introducing me to people at the bar.

 I also noticed that the people in the club were not "apeing" some gangsta
attire. These people had come to dance HOUSE. And, there was a big HOUSE
banner over the bar.  As a matter of fact, I soon felt more safe in this
club, than I do when I'm at 3rd & Army in Little Caesar's. 

Another thing about the Warehouse I liked was that they had the
AIR-CONDITIONING on down to a chill level. I stayed cool all night, and it
removed the smoke from the air.  Bravo to that!!!!!!!!

I moved out onto the dance floor, and dj Joe Smooth was soooo great. I've
never seen a dj whip a group of people into such a frenzy!!! And I mean,
FRENZY.

The energy level was so high, I couldn't believe it. I was dancing, and
groups did some circle dancing, and some couples did the "bump and Grind."
Other individuals just "went off."

Pretty soon people that I was dancing near were smiling and laughing and
encouraging me. Before I knew it, they were high-fiving me, and coming out to
dance next to me. By then, all my fears had been dispelled. 

Since I was one of the the only white guys in the club, I learned I had soon
become the subject of a rumor. Someone thought they recognized me as an
executive with the Chicago Bulls basketball team. Someone came up and asked
me if that was true.  I momentarily considered adopting this persona for the
evening--if I had still been worrying about my saftey I probably would have.
But, I said "No." But, they seemed to be happy with my explanation of how I
got there.

I have to admit, that I didn't get a bad vibe at either club I visited. As a
matter of fact, people seemed to go out of their way to be friendly, and were
even more friendly when they learned I was from the Sfrave scene. 

Dj Deaks wrote me and said he had the same experience while he was in London.
 When people learn you are from SF, they think you're special. And the truth
is, we have a very special vibe here, one that goes beyond just partying and
dancing.

I stayed until 4:00am. Their permit was until 5:00am, and they serve alcohol
all night long. My group was leaving from the hotel at 7:15, for our 8:30am
flight back to SF.  I snuck back into the hotel at 4:30. Got up, went to the
airport. Sat in my seat, and woke up at the San Jose Airport. Glad to be
home, but also glad to be back in the City where the F&F vibes rules!!!!!!

Hope to see you all at Wicked.        Robertj...........Monterey

P.S.  Today is this SFravers 43rd birthday--May you all be having as much fun
dancing and raving as I am---Thank you all so much.

Yeah, I've had that same experience partying in New York.  One guy told 
me he'd been around most of the country raving but had never been to SF.  
He asked me is San Francisco was as cool as everyone says it is, with 
everyone smiling and sharing and being friendly.  Of course i said yes, 
it's true!  It's fun raving in other cities but the SF vibe is definitely 
uniquely special.

hi folx,
have some trepidations about bringing this up , what with the recent talk about
what is rave related and what is not. it turns out that there is something
like "raving" happening in the jewish community which goes by the name of
(jewish) renewal.   next sat., nov 19: michael
lerner of TIKKUN magazine will talk about his new book, JEWISH RENEWAL. it
 is a very interesting book. can't really summarize it here.let me just say
that he  is trying nothing less than the "impossible": bring together
spirituality, politics , personal transformation and 'religious' practice.
he has some really good ideas. anyway, if  people are interested should
contact me for details.   the 'price' of going is to have his book
or buy it at the event. it's about $25. let me know.
take care/shalom
ovid

I propose:
a.) hopping up and down, clapping your hands and hugging the fu*k out of someone
b.) bein' funk-E
c.) dressin' up and snubbing your fellow humans
d.) fryin' balls and laughing at the walls
e.) removing gum from your pants

or maybe something a widdle bit more.......

Lotsa buzz,

 Mijos, I got so into the habit of grabbing fliers, that on a recent stroll
thru the gauntlet of preachers, speakers, converters and missionaries that
now control the Sproul plaza of Berkeley, I forgot to just say no.
 Of course, when you accept one of their fliers, they are so blown that
they almost cry, and so of course I start talking to them, before I even
know what they want (my soul, to be forwarded to savior@heaven.sky).

Nah-nah-nah-no, don't knock me yet. I'll try anything once, even organized
belief systems with lotsa rules, just to see their general leaning, 'cause
I am still searching. So one meeting should do it, right? Problem is, they
all call me. Every night. 

-Milton! Right? Remeber me? Yeah, Karyn, with the Church of Unification.
Yesterday, I .....
-Milton, Charles. Howzitgoinmybrotha! Can you come down to the Lutherans
for Cal rally this Sunday...
-Milty, hey, we gotta talk at the Saturday Afternoon with Allah...
-Milton, you said you were interested in the "christian drumming circle"?
        (very seductive! Hisssss, an apple, my faithful one?)
So when "naw, I got work" or "I gotta see some friends" or the powerful
"Midterms, yaknow" comes out, they say "I can meet you anytime during the
week. We won't be underconverted. We'll beat any faith's offer." The
lutheran literally counter-proposaled the Moonies!
Now that's sales pressure! whoa! I can't resist! So I guess I'll say yes,
to all of them. And set the same date, same room, etc. This will be a
slug-fest unseen since the last crusade, with  tag-team full-contact
conversion! The Jews for Jesus will interupt the Golden Bears Jihad while
the Lutheran and the Moonies pull on my soul's arms "he's mine, mine I tell
you!"

Up in the sky, The Big Guy rolls his eyes then laughs as I stroll out of
the room, leaving the Faithful Forcefuls behind. Problem is, they'll
probably start a new cult...Miltonian Revisionist Theory. Sounds cool, but
can I get it into children's books?

Lotsa love, of the true kind,
 Milton and the E-bee....

Or how about the whole event in women's clothing? As a casual wearer of
threads of the feminine vibe,I must state it just feels good. Dresses give
you so much freedom, it's a mystery why we don't use them more. Pants are
an abomination. Women's pants, even worse. Their zipper ends where my
necessites begin, and the waist is waaay up there. I had to do conversons
on most of mine. But they give you a 100% new look, you KNOW you're the
only guy in there with that outfit.
If the shirts are large enuf, they do look magical, especially the
fluffy/ruffled ones.  Love to see someone serious, like Jeno, wearing a
"little french maid" outfit with fishnets, or Simon in a wedding dress.
Ooooh, my palms are sweaty!

	I thought he had 'permits' to produce schedule 1 substances (at 
least that is wirtten in his book). Did they get revoked? Well, I will 
curse the DEA, FDA, and a few other governmental agencies that know what 
is best for number 145-xx-xxxxx, because, why how could anyone ever make 
their own decisions. Better to run and hide and have everythig laid out 
for you , that if it doesn't make everything perfect (and it will not) 
you can blame someone else....
	We wouildn't want to give the people the responsiblity of pulling 
their own minds through life would we? No, that would be horrible, just 
like of all the immoral things that would go on (nevermind that others 
find my pushing for moprality actually immoral, their immoral bisexual 
sinners anyway). 
	Well, ok that generalization is a tad broad. If my point is to 
make some people think, it does little to go and spout one side trying to 
gib the other. BUt when I do believe as strongly as I do that people need 
take responsiblity for themselves, it is hard not to do what I have done 
above. In fact, in doing so, I have voilated my own rules, taking the gib 
of the vocal opposition. Anyway, I have lost my train of thought, (or 
skipped far ahead), so this post wil end

Hang on a second... I saw the original post on a different mailing list.  If
I had it I would forward it here.  It wasn't quite a "raid" and his permits
have not yet been revoked.  It was an "inspection", and the message that I
read discribing it hypothosized that they were looking to hit Shulgin with
lots of fines for not following obscure EPA regulations (the minimum fine
being $5,000).  Note that *no* fines have yet been handed out, and Shulgin
has not yet been shut down.  We might just be getting a bit paranoid here.  Of
course, it is possible that they really are out to get us. ;-)

/*
 *  the following letter was sent in october 1994 by a monk who lives
 *  in europe.  it will be published in the next MAPS Newsletter.
 */

Dear Rick,

 Thanks for sending the latest issue of MAPS and congratulations on the
breakthroughs in the research. "Perseverance furthers" - I Ching.

 Well, I not only had a ball in England at the rave, but got an education and
personal liberation. I had not been to a dance since I became a monk yet I
used to love to dance and was part of the scene in the 60's.

 What blew my mind was the fact that I'll be 70 this year (in late November
and will be in Bangkok on that day at a Buddhist conference).  I was so taken
by the MDMA and the music that I danced from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.  It had a very
strong impact on me, since I could totally give myself to the rhythm and was
in sort of trance, which reminded me very much of the Native American dances
which I witnessed in New Mexico. It also occurred to me that the DJ was a
kind of shaman. Having gotten over the initial 'shock' of the rave, I  have
had time to muse over the whole experience. I've come to the conclusion that
rave dancing could be a very important aspect of the spiritual path. It is
not only fun and relaxing but is also creative, that is, liberating. The
other night I went to a night club to dance with three visiting monks from
Mt. Baldy!

 As to the use of MDMA, of course, I'm all in favor IF it is done in the
proper way under the right circumstances- whatever that it.  I would have to
give it much more thought and experimenting to have the answer to that.

 The effect MDMA has on me is like a magnifying glass. I use it only once or
twice a year (my supply is very limited) for meditation. I can focus more
sharply and the content becomes more magnified and I see more with my mind's
eye.  The only thing I don't like is that I become rather intent with a
strong feeling of urgency. I gave a talk about a year ago while under the
influence of MDMA and that didn't go over too well, saying things that were
beyond the listeners grasp.

                              Hope you are happy and well,
                                            H.

No, his paperwork is good. But the DEA still hates him, so they
brought in the EPA trying to find a score of tiny violations, all
carrying industrial strength fines. THEN they would have good grounds
for revoking his permits.

The DEA is looking more like the KGB each day. Why, there's even a
"Drug Czar".

Unfortunately it'll take time and a lot more ruined lives before the
average american wakes up.

 Since we are soon planning for future F&F's, I'm looking for the 
 E-mail address for Todd ??? who talked with Ethan about being interested
 in video etc. We had a short ( far too short ) meeting at the last
 F&F. If you're still interested in doing some video etc. E-mail me for
 details.

 As for Sound Traffic Control : quirky artsy affair with some hits and
 some misses IMO. When I first entered there was a band (guitar, trumpet,
 drums) playing cheezy songs like Herb Alpert's Lonely Bull from the 60's.
 Later more environmental stuff. Then there was a large rack of appliances
 like blenders, mixers, etc with lights throughout that were turned on and
 off via computer controller so there was a "machine performance" work. 
 Couches, TV's, lamps etc spread throughout the main floor with people
 lounging everywhere. As the evening progressed the music moved more into
 the realm of more "progressive ambient" music with beats which I preferred
 in the particular setting. Speakers were everywhere and walking around did
 give many different "sonic environments". I left early < 1 AM so I don't
 know how it all turned out...

 Is the event set for tonight more of the same or does it take a different
 direction ? Inquiring mind wants to KNOW....

Xo perereca! This was a wank, 100%. A middle-brow, wish-I-was-a-Beat,
impersonal mixer, lots of olives in cocktails, with a 2am meat-market 
rush, wank.
Besides allen, I was entertained by earth-child, handiboy, mikebee, Sy,
Brian G.(you go, girl!) and that's it. We seemed to be the only ones who
paid, the above mentioned art czars were apparently all on the guest list!

A chinese woman took the mike,  sang and railed and wailed, and they looped
her voice and shuffled it, so it seemed like another singer was hidden, but
it soon got cheesy and it felt like "next!"
Next being a wall of appliances... Okay, seeing a blender with cool-aid and
styrofoam go off with lights and sound is cool, but loses its novelty in 2
minutes, and seems i've seen this all before.... If you felt Cage was the
main musical moment of this century, this event was for you. The floor was
covered with sofas and tv's, trying to get some comment on suburbia into
it, but just barely trying....

Cheb-i-sabbah came on later, mixed vinyl,CD and DAT,  totally blew us away.
He was easily worth the wait, and whoever was on before him  played what
Brian called "140bpm ambient" to which several did the jerk-and-twitch.
These two had more of what I went there for, I admit I went  expecting warm
squishies  and smiles, and a puppy-dog pile, but my dissapointment was
genuine:tho I love exposure to something new, this was nothing new. Plus it
seemed sorta like the showcasing/imposition the zippies are accused of,
with lotsa ego in some of the performances....less of "enjoy and share  my
art" than "look at me!" 

I expect tonight to be more "entertainment" and less a showcase for
recycled art, even if that sounds closed and shallow on my part. I really
am looking for cheb's set and something you can dance to or chill with. For
10$ it is worth checking out if you want to hear cheb-i-sabbah and some
other stuff, it was incredible. But then there's Kinetic.....

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....

Hi:

I've been informed that I'm losing my school account in a few weeks.
I want to get an account on an Internet provider that will give me Slip
connections and all my favoriate alt.* groups and some disk space and
a flat fee per monthn and hopefully 800 dialin. Those of you who have
accounts at netcom, crl, &c., I'd appreciate it if you'd mail me your 
opinions of the service you're getting.  This probably calls for private
e-mail unless somebody has a net.horror-story that they can't resist
shareing.

 You lucky ravers! Have fun for me - I'm taking myself out of the rave

need to concentrate on .  I'll be reading my SFRAVES mail for vicarious
rave thrills , so be free and outrageous for me!

I did not make it to Townsend as I wanted to hear DRC spin.  It had been
awhile since I heard her.  Kenetic turned out to be a good choice.  The
basement/warehouse space was just incredible.  I like that type of space,
low ceiling, big wood columns and cool.  The carpet was great to sit on but
it made it a little hard to dance.

I got there early so I got to hear the first dj (I forget his name). He
started with some rather lame house but half way thru his set he picked up
some great trancey stuff and kept that going strong until DRC came on I
think around 12:30.  Anyway she increased the BPM to a franzy.  She was
absolutely wild and she had alot of new stuff I had not heard her spin
before which made it even better.  I danced for almost her entire set and
stopped only for a few minutes 'cause my legs were giving up. I did leave
early, around 2:30 right after her set.

The crowd started to trickle in rather late.  There was lots of space to
dance which was great 'cause I love to spread those wings.

I thought the crowd was rather young for my taste.  Never could pick up on
a good people vibe.  Not too many warm and friendly smiles. (I guess I get
spoiled after good parties like F&F's).  But the music kept me going
anyway.

There was a black guy there who danced from the time I got there to the
time I left.  Talk about good energy! (What was your name?)  There were a
few other people who danced with great energy.  I like it when people go to
parties to dance rather than stand around and look pretty!

How was it after 2:30???

Anyway, hope to be able to fly over to Wicked tonight!

AN Irish dj who from my point of view has brought good jungle
to sf , PAUL, will be spining at kenetic next friday.

If anybody has the impression that jungle is just hardcore breakbeat techno
with a nasty vibe has got to meet paul.

the newist arrival on the jungle scene is Kit a fifteen year old dj from 
minisota .

Viva candyflipping, ghb, basebins and Jungle in your Organic Pajamas.

Does anyone know when alex is spinning tonight?
salutations, allen@ameba

re-immersion had an odd crowd.
The living room ambient area and wall of robots made me sleepy.
I would have made it more lavish - fine sitting furniture
and lowered the volume to allow conversation - would a
few characters/cast members have busted the bank?  The
music was fine but I didn't hear much of an attempt to
to, uh, do anything with it.  Did I miss something?
I was hoping for a dada animitronics room.
I don't get these ambient parties, I guess.
Thoughts of passed out college kids blasting 
pink floyd in their dorm rooms did cross my mind.
Is 13 channel super surround sound the same as having
the bedspins?  This might have been the un-subtle volume.
Thomas played AC/DC.  He is apparently a long time fan.	

zendada also had an odd crowd but a nice fruit tray.
Taj was not spinning anything that moved me.  I'd call
it an off night or at least mismatched to my mood.
Caught the beginning of Jeno's set which sounded
pretty good.  Was this his wicked warmup? 

a divine city evening
house sophisticates

The following message is from Glenn Mayfield.  - Dave C

***********************
To All My Sunset/Pacific Friends, Family, Pals, etc.,

This is Glenn, aka "Gabe" :).  I just wanted to let you know that
I will be using the the film footage I shot early on at the last 
Sunset of all of you, as part of a film tribute i am undertaking
in 16 mm format, currently under the working title of "Solace!".
It's basically going to be a visual meditation on the people, the
vibe, the intensity, and the places that make Sunset go off, set
to portions of the dj mixes.

I'm still planning on shooting more footage this fall and spring,
as well as blowing up Super-8 footage for the film.  So if you've
got a Super-8 camera, film away!  I'm open for input and collaboration
from everyone interested.  Also, I've had a chance to talk, here and there withsome people about the possibility of throwing a benefit party for the film
at some point.  I'd like to hear your response.  You can reach me at
(510) 531-6035.  Anyway, I'll be minding my cameras and I hope to run into
you soon.

Glenn/Gabe Reel :)

  I had a rather disturbing experience last night at Diverse City.  When 
we arrived, the party had allready been busted but we saw some people 
gathered in a parking lot trying to have a parking lot party.  We pulled 
into the lot and a VERY young looking girl came rushing up to the car.  
She explained how the party got busted but, "We can have a parking lot 
party! And if your on drugs, your happy anyways!!!" and then she skipped 
away back to her group of friends.

  I know drugs have and always will be apart of any musical events and 
raves in particular, but this was a sad image of a VERY young (must have 
been 14) girl obviously very high on E and not caring what the hell she 
was doing as long as she was high.  

  As we pulled away another odd thing happened.  The young rave girl came 
running up to the car and started to tell us that there was going to be 
another party.  She yelled to her friends who told her it was "Friends 
and Family at 16th and Harisson and it starts at 3am."  Obviously the 
messsage posted about the F&F meeting somehow got turned into a F&F party 
starting at 3am..

  Anyways, I was really disturbed by the image of the young girl and 
confused as to how the F&F meeting could suddenly be an F&F party at 3am..?
What is happening to our young these days??

Peace out...

-Ernie

tough question--i think it's important for older people in the 
scene, and people with more experience with drugs, to set 
an example of responsible drug use.  This needs to go beyond blanket 
statements like "exstacy is good; speed is bad."  Situations like the 
one you described are a little disturbing but i think if we look out 
for each other hopefully everyone will be ok.  (Still though, i 
can't help thinking--i sure wasn't skipping around parking lots high 
on e in the middle of the night when _i_ was 14! maybe i was just too 
much of a geek)    --jessica

yeah diverse city got busted around 1 am when the cops came by twice 
on a noise complaint and shut it down. they were really really nice about
it all tho. really cool and chill to talk with also. the party was 
good and prob wouldve been good also. oh well.

one thing that i have noticed a lot about people who seem a bit out of
control on e or acid or whatever that (1) they are going through a phase
of drug experimentation which usually ends or (2) they get a lot more
responsable about it as time goes on.

to me it seems almost natural for a lot of people to go on like this

Wicked at the Troc!  was it just me or was everyone just totally having 
the best time?

Maybe it was the free water.

Maybe it was the fact that it wasn't too hot or humid.

Maybe it was the fact that when the sun came up and the room lit up, 
everyone was still going at it with the such passion and delight.

Maybe it was all the super-smiley faces...

I'm still trying to figure out what seemed like an "experiment" as we 
heard several minutes of music which was very very fast and I would 
believe to be out of the "house" realm.  I enjoyed it very much as did a 
few others scattered about the floor, but most of the ravers lost their 
groove and couldn't hook into the faster beat or something so they stood 
around in anticipation for the familiar four on the floor to kick back 
in.  It eventually did and all was well.  What an interlude!  I dunno who 
it was because I couldn't get near the DJ's, but it was definitely a bold 
move.  I dug on it.

I'm posting this for informational purposes.

My personal feeling is that they have essentially the right idea
although I think a little less ranting (and a little more raving :)
is in order if they want to seriously make an impact, still if they are
seeking the attention of the Media (which it seems to me that this is all about)
they better have their act together when the eye of camera is turned on them.

So far, from what I've seen of the Zippies around here (in SF) as far as their
non-verbal output is concerned, I'm not impressed.

INTERNET INVASION of BRITAIN WEEK ONE
brought to you by THE ZIPPY INVASION TASK FORCE
AIM: TO VOICE OUR OUTRAGE AT THE VIRTUAL BANNING OF RAVE IN THE UK
METHOD: USE THE INTERNET TO SEND PROTESTS TO UK GOVERNMENT AND ITS  CITIZENS

This week we up the intensity as this thing goes GLOBAL!!! 
The Internet Invasion of Britain has Spread WorldWide with Australia, South
Africa, Holland, Sweden and Japan entering the fight.

We are still awaiting word as to exactly what effect the Invasion has had on
UK networks. By all accounts there is a concerted attempt by British
Authorities to keep this story quiet. BUT word has already gotten out to our
cyberactivists within the UK (ground zero) who are monitoring the extent of
the "collapse". Their message: KEEP UP THE PRESSURE, THE INTERNET INVASION OF
BRITAIN CONTINUES

TARGET SURRENDER DATE: December 1st 1994. THIS COULD BE THE WORLDS FIRST
INTERNET ORCHESTRATED "COUP DE ETAT" Any guesses as to the exact timing of
John Majors resignation announcement? 

"This is not just an INVASION, it's an INTER-VASION" - Dr Timothy Leary

PROTEST BACKGROUND
[A  World Wide Web site for info on the  Criminal Justice Bill is available
at the following URL:] 
http://www.bath.ac.uk/~bs2ajs/CJ.Bill.html

The United Kingdom Govt's Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (its now no
longer a Bill) THREATENS THE RIGHT OF ALL GLOBAL CITIZENS TO ASSEMBLE. With
legal developments in Western countries increasingly interconnected, THIS
ASSAULT, IF WE IGNORE IT, WILL ULTIMATELY THREATEN INTERNET "ASSEMBLY" ITSELF

Unlike the 1989 Fax for Freedom in support of Chinese students in Tienanmen
Square, the Internet community is now empowered to vote on GLOBAL ISSUES by
electronically "assembling" to voice actual world opinion. Vote with your
fingers to affect world history!

What to do / How to spread the meme.

1. REPLICATE: Alert your Internet cybercommunity by distributing this message
as far as possible. This is an exercise in both information dispersal and
GLOBAL VOTING.

2. E-MAIL your PROTEST:  E-mail the attached protest or your own personalized
response to as many key UK addresses as possible (Government Depts,
Companies, Company Presidents, Ministers, Media, and your UK Friends as well
as your own national/local government officials.)
[United Kingdom Commercial e-mail addresses are available via publications
such as New Rider's Official Internet Yellow Pages and other resource lists.
UK Government Web Site: www.open.gov.uk, President Clinton:
president@whitehouse.com]

3. PARTICIPATE:    Discuss the implications of this issue and the concept of
a GLOBAL VOTE in as many forums as possible or organize your own
Data-Gathering. Call 415-281-KNOW  for invasion details.

Note: We are not attempting to gridlock the ENTIRE system but to rather bring
pressure to bear upon the United Kingdom and its citizens. 


SUGGESTED PROTEST MESSAGE:
Recognizing that the principle involved in the British Criminal Justice Bill
now being written into law, involves the banning of "gatherings of more than
10 people on public land" and may eventually be introduced into my home
country and eventually may prohibit Internet "gatherings" in the public land
of Cyberia, we, the Undersigned, protest with all our hearts and will. And we
implore you to do all in your power to erase this shameful bill and its
intention from planetary consciousness.

Signed: [your e-mail address]

BACKGROUND TO THE Public Order section of the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act  of  GREAT BRITAIN
At 1:30 am [Friday 4 Nov, Pacific Time] the Queen gave her Royal assent to
most of the clauses in The Criminal Justice Bill. The Bill seeks to change a
number of aspects of the British Justice System.While rectifying overdue
legal loopholes, it also contains some unpopular measures that erode basic
human rights.

These rights are:
1. The right to ASSEMBLE in groups of ten or more individuals ON PUBLIC  or
COMMON LAND. In other words, hanging out in a group of ten or more people in
a town square, a park, or the sidewalk becomes potentially illegal.

2. The right to ASSEMBLE on PRIVATE LAND if the gathering is for the express
purpose of listening to music typified as  "sounds wholly or
predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of
repetitive beats". In other words, engaging in the act of drumming, listening
to rockn roll or any music form containing a high number of repeated beats
SPECIFICALLY TECHNO now becomes illegal

3. The right to TRAVEL within the borders or ones country WITHOUT UNDUE
HARASSMENT or threat of arbitrary arrest. The bill gives British Police
increased powers to question and arrest people based solely on their
appearance. In this case the mere fact of looking like you might be on your
way to a party involving the playing of repetitive music is a basis for
harassment.

COMMENTARY
The people most directly affected by this bill are those who are most likely
to attend private or public gatherings in the UK [especially British Ravers].
But we are all affected by this move. The setting of this PRECEDENT  in a
western democracy such as the United Kingdom is grave cause for concern. What
we are seeing is a western government destroying the fundamental human rights
of its people. Specifically the right to assemble, which has its
philosophical pedigree in the French and American Revolutions and which has
long been considered the cornerstone of western style democracy 

The question we are asking you is this: "If WE do not voice OUR protest at
these developments in the UK, because we are not concerned that the right to
assemble in physical space in Britain might be taken away, and we do not at
the very least make ourselves heard in this battle, THEN WHO MIGHT there be
left to do likewise when our rights to assemble in our own geographical
regions as well as the virtual geographies of cyberspace, are threatened?

That was Markie and he tried to play some JUNGLE but most weren't into it.
The stuff that he played I dug, and found it easy to dance to although it
is a different mind/body space then the standard house/rave/tribal formula
that has made wicked popular, still my hats off to Markie for trying.

All in all a very nice party indeed, I'm hoping that we will see more Wickeds
there in the future.

If this crazy music happened at around 4:00am, you might be talking about
Markie.  He got on right after Thomas.  First track was some kind of funky
groovy stuff, then he went absolutely crazy with these jungle records.
Apparently he just got a bunch of them and he threw down about 3 or 4 of
them that night to start off his set, then followed it with his hard-acid/
hard-house/ progressive stuff.

I personally found this fast jungle music rather frightening...

It was a pretty good party.

That's one thing that irked me about Diverse City.  First of all, without
a permit (from what I understood from a police officer) how did the
promoters expect to get a party going all night (without any sort of
complaints from neighbors)?  When I pay money for a party, even $5, that
there is some agreement that the party will go all night.  "Bad" music,
"bad" people.. I can understand, but what happened Friday night was
bullshit to me.  A free party isn't going to make up for the 
frustration I felt when the party got busted.  (I hope I'm not 
misdirecting my frustrations and angers..)

     Wow,
     
     Another just *awesome* WICKED this weekend. It was so impressive to 
     see the 'sea' of people just getting down at 7:30 in the morning, as 
     the light shined in through the skylights! Amazing. The vibe at 
     WICKED's are just too cool, and this one at the Troc was no different. 
     I saw a ton of smiling hugging fun faces and people all night. Jeno 
     really did it again, in the morning hours. What a set! To those of who 
     I havent met, I was the guy in the checkered flag shirt and blinky 
     light :) Say "Hi" next time !! Cant wait for the next one... 
     
     Rave on folks..... Sy++

I got carded hard at the door (with an old but very legit passport, since
i don't drive).  Usually I've been able to get into the Troc in the past.
Hey, I'm fucking 39 years old, it's just a hard-ass door dude para military
attitude.  I don't need that shit, and apparently the Troc and/or Wicked
don't need my money enough to deal with me as a human instead of a
fully certificated humanoid.

And as I say once more . . .  fuk dat!!

I think we should ensure that all the security guards do some 'x' 
before work... then they could give everyone a hug as they come in :)

I just got off the phone with the promoter, Dave, for Diverse City.  I was
happy to hear from someone who genuinely seemed to care.  Apparently, two
weeks before, the same place was used for a rock concert or something like
that and had problems with noise complaints.  He didn't tell me directly..
but I'm assuming because of that rock concert, the permits for that
location (Portrero & 15th) was revoked.  Dave said he didn't know about
the location not having a permit until the owners told him after the
police came.  He says he's not going to use that location again, and is
looking for 18+ venues to use. 

I feel better knowing that he called me to try to explain what happened 
exactly.  I was put on the guest list for the next party.  I don't know 
if I'll go.. but I was happy to know that he put that gesture out for 
people.  

It still sucked that the event had to be busted for a reason the promoter 
had no control over.

It would be nice if every promoter and every raver had an e-mail account 
to be able to something that SFRaves allows to do.  (He also gave praise 
to F&F.. He'll be at F&F V!  :)  )

Getting down and WICKED!!
-------------------------

  After not being able to get out and dance for a whole two weeks,   I wanted
to make sure to do both Friday and Sat evenings this week.    Checking the old
trusty SFRaves calander,   I see the following...

Friday, November 11th - Sound Traffic Control presents Re-Immersion
        Sound Traffic Control, SpaceTime Continuum, Single Cell Orchestra
        + DJs Mark Farina, Thomas, Felix, Cheb I Sabbah, Naut Humon
        midnight, $10, 21+, 174 King St  415.522.7380
        
  This one was rather interesting,   but I missed the best dancable stuff
by the time I got there (Around 2:30 am).    I took some time to talk with
the security goons to make sure I had a guarentee that I would be able to 
get an opportunity to at least get some fresh air.    My last experience 
with this venue left me with a $650 doctor bill after I had to have mu lungs
pumped to remove all the tobacco gunk.   I also queried people who were
leaving,   and was assured that it wasn't hot or that stuffy inside.
So, I go inside to check it out.    By that time,  I was able to talk
them into letting me get in for only $5.

  When I walked in,   there was this sort of demonstration or "Performance"
using household appliances as musical instruments.   The whining of vacuum
cleaners,  blenders,   and other household appliances were amplified and
special audio enhancements made for a very interesting aural experience.
It was OK,   but I got bored rather quickly and headed over to the dance
area.    At that time,   there was Regge,  and Acid Jazz type of music
(A little two slow for my tastes),  so I schmoozed around for a while,
talking with some of the folks putting this on.

   It turns out that the AES (Audio Engeneering Society) convention was
in town,  thus was the explanation for all the high end recording studio
equipment involved with the performance.

   So,  around 4:00 am,   I left and headed back to 1015 Folsom St and
check out Zendada.    Dakota was pretty much finished,  but the basement
was still hoppin,  and Jeno was really getting off big time.   I danced 
my ass off like there was no tommorrow to make up for last weekend.

Friday, November 11th - Go Figure
        Taj  Dante  John Mac  Simon
        Deviant Ambient by Paolo and the Reverend Marcus
        $5, for more info: 415.974.9464

I really wanted to go to this one,  but at the last moment,  it was cancelled
due to non-acquisition of a venue.   The info line mentioned Kenetic but gave
NO phone number.    I tried to find out where Kenetic was,   but not getting
access to the net I didn't find out in time.    Darn!! I heard it was rather
smallish and very good vibe.   I called Ameba but they were closed by that
time,  so couldn't find it.

Saturday, November 12th - Diverse City
        Graeme  Galen  Goa Gil
        $5 b4 12.  415.469.2027

I never made it to Diverse City,  then later on,  learned that it got busted
around 1 am.   

Saturday, November 12th - Cool World presents Buzztown
        DJs Jon Williams  Simon  Dj Overlord (NY)  Tony  LP (Florida's #1 DJ)
        Barry Weaver  Dutch  Liquid  Select (Florida)  Dave Alga  Ghost  Maxx 
        Christophe  Frank Nitty  Jazz-E  Lumpy  Spinner  Ray Vonie
        X-L  Mariah  Sergio
        Live in concert:  DARWIN CHAMBER  The Soul Providers
        A portion of the proceeds will be contributed to Project Open Hand.
        COW PALACE, San Francisco, Geneva & Santos St.
        All ages welcome, all night
        Admission is $15 in advance / $20 night of the show.  
        Advance tickets on sale Nov. 1 @ all Bass outlets  (510)762-BASS
        Tickets are also available @ The Cow Palace Box Office 
        from Nov. 1st until the day of the show for $15 with no service charge.
        (415)979-4543   (408)235-1077   (916)449-3111

After going to an earlier one this summer,   I figured that this was far too
much commercialized for my tastes.   so I kissed it off,  and went to WICKED
instead.

Saturday, November 12th - Wicked
        Jeno  Garth  Markie  Thomas
        415.512.5713

This time,  it was at the Trocadero....  Oh goodie.  A reasonable venue.   As
expected,   Garth started off his usual housey set to get the mood going as
people started arriving way after midnight.    People weren't even getting 
let in until about midnight.   Thanx to David for bringing me.   

It wasn't long before the temperature started to climb up to that WICKED level,
but the Troc did a good job this time in keeping it to a tolerable level.  Just
in case,  I brought my shorts (dispite the very cold evening).   The energy
was totally insane.    By this time,  it was my 2nd all-nighter,  but you never
would have known it,  and I didn't even care,   as I had energy to spare.
Besides,   I feel MUCH better if I don't sleep at all on weekends.

About 4:30 or so,  the crowds thinned out slightly (When most of the AES suits
left), and it actually got rather cool inside,  so I stepped up my dancing
energy to keep warm.

I was surprised to learn that WICKED was to go until 8 am (Oh goodie,  another
2 more hours of dancing time.    I certainly made the most of it,   but 8 am
finally arrived (All too soon),  so I packed it up and David brought me home.

More later....

Nope, it was 21+. Hence one of our party not being able to get in, hence
getting to Diverse City about 132 seconds before the police came in and
shut it down, hence looking for Preston's beach party, but getting there
too early, hence going back to Wicked around 4am and having a great time!

there was an 18+ wicked at 19th and alabama this summer--i think in june, 
or maybe july.  It was really big, and had a really fun mix of ages i 
thought.  On the other hand it was one of the less intimate wickeds i've

It's up to the promoter to verify that the proper permits exist. All it
takes is one qustion.

I thought it was funny that the cops didn't even know what permits were
necessary. They just said "uhhh, multiple permits, I think." I'd guess at
the minimum they'd need a fire inspection to establish capacity and safety.

I thought it was uncool for them to charge us as the cops were coming up
the stairs.

I totally agree with this!  Lotsa people who do E for their first time 
find it THE most incredible experince.  It's new, amazing, and just 
soooooo fun.  They just wanna take more and more.  Evenshully tho all 
these people end up chillin out and cuttin back.  E espeshully I think 
gets kinda boring when I take it often.  I find it sooo much more 
effective to wait a long time between uses for a maximum effect.  Anyway, 
I think that my point is that as long as people stick with non-addictive 
stuff chances are they wont go totally overboard And will chill out in 
due time!

while i too worry about young people taking drugs,
the attitude that im READING (not necesarily intended by writer)
sounds very patronizing...

i'm really having trouble phrasing anythign in this post...
(and i jsut deleted half of it cuz it just soudns too preachy)

cuz i really do worry about drug use, especially among young adults
(and even younger people)
BUT i dont really want to say something like,
"Well, Im older, i know better than you"

cuz that's just bullshit... i know a lot of people
younger than me who have a lot more life experience than me
and its a different kind of experience
so i do things that they think are foolish
and vice versa.. we can both learn from each other, though
and i think (hope) that would be the point

Exactly.

Unfortunately, the terms we use have so much baggage that, for sanity's 
sake, you just have to try to use them as best you can, even when they 
don't quite fit.

For the most part, the concepts behind "matriarchal rule" are widely varied. 

Take the Cherokee nation -- this was a tribe of men and women who, while 
having matrilineal descent, did *not* shout down the voice of the other. 
Decisions were/are made on a consensual basis; by the group comprising 
the tribal elders, not a hierarchical one.

I'd love to discuss this further -- sorry it took so long to get back to 
you...

And to you :)

ps: a Navajo friend of mine confirmed this weekend that their tribal 
governance is virtually the same as the Cherokee with respect to gvernment.

I have some other interesting gender/sex related info as well... I'll get 
back to ya'...

This will be kind of vague so bear with me:

I heard about an event this weekend (Friday probably) in SF that had 
spots on the dance floor which would trigger different song elements if 
stepped on.  There were also really intense visuals, including footage of 
kitchen appliances being zoomed in on very quickly.

Ok, I know that's not much to go on, but if you know...

This Thursday is the Annual Great American Smoke-Out!!

On this day, people who smoke are asked to consider the benefits they can 
expect from stopping smoking tobacco. There is counseling and other 
assistance for those who desire it, and of course tons of love and 
support from folks like me :) ...

I'm hoping that my friends and family in this community who smoke tobacco 
will try stopping this Thursday, even if only as an experiment. No 
obligation to buy, so to speak... and if there is anything I can do to 
help, let me know, and I'll try my best -- even if you just want to bitch 
and complain a little to someone :)

Love & Hugs,

Maui

dana comments on 14 yr old e girl,
> (and i just deleted half of it cuz it just sounds too preachy)

I'll preach.  It sounds like a sad situation.  While every adult
I have known to take e has found it very natural and easy to go through
the 'first experience binges' and then mellow out it is ludicrous to 
think that should apply to a 14 year old.  There are big physical and
psychological differences between 14 and (say) 18.  I think it is
dangerous and bad for someone that young to be getting so high.  

I don't think *any* "research" about e and its *so-called* lack of harmful
side affects applies to an adolescent mind and body.  Personally, I think
it is naive for anyone to buy into the shit as a harmless love drug.  I don't 
care who has written what book.  If an adult chooses to take the risk (health
and legal) then they should go for it.  That is the distinction I make.

There is often a fair amount of debate on this list as to the merits or 
otherwise of various substances, as well as their natures -- addictive, 
non-addictive, habituating, etc.

Unlike many of the substances we usually discuss, there is one that we 
know for certain is more addictive than heroin, than meth, than 
alcohol... any drug available. It's nicotine. Yup. More addictive than 
heroin:

  Heroin user quitting --         relapse rate -- 55%

  Tobacco smoker quitting --      relapse rate -- 85%

These statistics can be found in a Consumer Reports compendium of information 
titled "Licit and Illicit Drugs". As with the magazine they put out, CR 
is not beholden to corporate interest and does not have a political agenda.
As a result, their data is quite reliable, and has stood up to challenge.

If it matters, I was thinking of going to this event... called the number
and then it was something like (paraphrasing) "Ok, here are the directions: 
Coming from 880, somethingreallyfastastreetabuilding and voila! yer there!
Coming from 101, take this exit and follow above directions...
PEACEpositiveLove etc etc" 

Whoa?  what was that after "Ok"?  can I rewind? jeepers.

Hmm, that is quite interesting. I myself am 15 and haven't used E yet, 
and don't really want to. People going to raves for the drugs isn't that 
genuine in my opinion, the reason for going to raves is for the music and 
the mutual vibe, right?

Too bad you missed out.  This party was meant to be like the

First of all, Dave is the same guy that used to throw the old 
Happy Happy Joy Joy parties a few years back.  He has NEVER had 
permits for a party, and I don't think even one of them has 
gone off without getting busted.  I've been at 4 of his parties 
that have been broken up within 2 hours of the start.  Before 
everyone goes running around talking about how commercial Cool 
World is, maybe you should pay to get into a party that you 
KNOW won't get broken up, and the music will go on all night.  
Drugs are no fun when you have 100 police cars there and you 
have to drive home...

First off... while I can definitely see connections between the elections 
and the rave scene, it's harder to see a connection here, and in my 
opinion the debate around smoking doesn't really belong here... 

Secondly, I have a lot of trouble advocating that people stop smoking tobacco
while also advocating the legalization of other drugs, some of which are
smoked with similar risks.  Limits on smoking in public places is fine, but
I'll never argue there's something wrong with doing it privately. Replies via
private email please.

As I said to someone this weekend - raves aren't "about" drugs, but a lot 
of it has to do with the "psychedelic mindset".  Don't *even* ask me for 
a definition of that.... but I think a lot of people get that mindset 
naturally through their environment, either by the books they read or the 
people they grew up around, etc.  If you like the music, you probably 
have that mindset.... if you like the people and don't mind the hours, 
you probably have that mindset too.  Psychedelics are an introduction to 
that mindset for many people - for some that introduction is boring, for 
others it's breathtaking.  

As to "genuine"... going to raves just for the drugs is like going to the 
movies just for the popcorn.  Yeah, it shouldn't be the only reason, but 
it shouldn't be discounted as a bad or false thing....

I'd agree that nicotine is easily AS addictive as heroin, but I can't 
say that I think it is MORE so. Relapse rates can be quite 
misleading. Think if heroin was legal, if there was quality assurance 
so you'd know you would not drop dead from a dose, if it was 
readily available, and most importantly if it was *accepted* and even 
*encouraged* in our culture...I think the relapse rates would be 
much higher! I know SO many junkies that would still be using if they 
could support their habit on a normal salary.

But certainly I would agree"legal" drugs have an insidiousness about 
them that warrants extra caution...because it is still OK in 
our culture to become addicted to nicotine, the addiciton is that 
much more easily developed and fed, and less recognizable.

It's the troc, i think, not wicked--that place seems to have a history of 
really uptight door security, esp. w/ regard to IDs.  At least that's 
been my experience.  I would much rather blame the troc than the wicked

This sounds too familiar. Why?

"It's not Wicked, it's ______________." "Oh, that's not Wicked's fault, 
that was ___________________."

Sheesh.

It is an effort against all types of smoke that are commercially

I think this is a prime example of why people think cool world is so
commercial. You just assumed that everybody going was on drugs & would
have to worry about driving home if the party got busted because it lacked
the proper permits, which is why people should go to your permited party,
so they can take take their two hits of E with a bunch of fourteen year
old girls living out their youth by joining in on the drug festivities.
Maybe if you guys through some free parties with all that money your
making, or didn't throw parties at places like the cow palace & got some
decent dj's, people wouldn't call it commercial.

Yesterday, I bought a used copy of 'Love U More' at Ameba.  I mean, it's

Today, I heard 'Love U More' on the muzak in the place I was eating
dinner.  (Followed by Dylan's 'Lay Lady Lay' for whatever that's worth.)

Quote:

As I said to someone this weekend - raves aren't "about" drugs, but a lot 
of it has to do with the "psychedelic mindset".  Don't *even* ask me for 
a definition of that.... but I think a lot of people get that mindset 
naturally through their environment, either by the books they read or the 
people they grew up around, etc.  If you like the music, you probably 
have that mindset.... if you like the people and don't mind the hours, 
you probably have that mindset too.  Psychedelics are an introduction to 
that mindset for many people - for some that introduction is boring, for 
others it's breathtaking.  
 
As to "genuine"... going to raves just for the drugs is like going to the 
movies just for the popcorn.  Yeah, it shouldn't be the only reason, but 
it shouldn't be discounted as a bad or false thing....

>

That is true. Certain drugs do increase some people's overall enjoyment 
of the environment, but like you said, it's all in the person's 
interests. If someone goes to a rave and uses them to enhance their 
experience, then that is fine. Although, drugs for drugs' sake is not.

 I don't consider doing drugs "living".  Its more a vacation from living.
 Its a momentary pause in life.  I can't believe living your youth means
dropping E at age 14...something doesn't sit well with me.  Maybe its because
she's 14.  Maybe its because she's using, what I consider, a hard drug at an
age where she's not even in high school, or maybe just a freshman in high
school.  Its use early on that somewhat scares me.  I don't question her good
time.  I question her means to enjoy that time.  I can't except that she is
"living her youth" by doing E or any type of pharmaceutical.  If we can learn
anything by subbing to this list its that enjoying life (and raves) doesn't
come from the drugs but from yourself and others who share that commitment
and enthusiasum.  Yeah, yeah it enhances it sometimes, but a continual use
means BURN OUT.  And besides, if she is 14, how can we expect her to act.
 Not many people out there know what's up at age 14; anyways she'll
learn...just throwin' in my alms worth...rave on =)

Sounds like she was living her youth and having a good time...  
Maybe people should be more critical of themselves, before they 
go judging other people.

These relapse rates I listed have only one purpose: they show that, for 
*whatever reason, only 15% of those who tried could quit nicotine*. 
That's it. They are *not* misleading in this instance, because that was 
all I was trying to have them show!

OK, I wave my magic wand....

All "recreational" drugs are legal. There are strict quality standards.

Well, first of all, why would your junkie friends necessarily be using 
heroin? There are many much nicer forms of opiate pleasure in the world, 
and if they weren't illegal anymore, most folks would likely prefer them 
to heroin, just as they did before the 1914 Harrison Act. Don't forget, 
heroin did not gain its status as the major opiate of abuse until it 
became an issue of *cargo bulk* -- one can make alot more $$ with less 
risk smuggling heroin rather than opium, but only if *the drugs are illegal*.

Since we've gotten rid of the Harrison Act, we also have cannabis at our 
disposal. Since that will grow just about anywhere, and can be used for 
making paper, cloth, fuel, ink, food, and many other staples I won't 
bother to list here, many folks will use that as their drug of choice.

But getting back to the opiates, I must point out that these drugs are 
not the public health scourge they are assumed to be; they never were. Of 
course there were some folks who used them to the point of personal harm 
-- some folks will abuse *water*, if you know what I mean :) ...

One guy that comes to mind is Dr. William Harvey, one of the folks who 
revolutionized surgical medicine. He was a morphine addict, and it wasn't 
exactly a well-kept secret -- but it didn't interfere with his work, 
either. As long as he received the doses he required, he was fine... 
"brilliant" was the word used, actually. And, as there was no legality 
nonsense, he was free to contribute his knowledge and learning to the 
rest of us.

Contrary to popular opinion, there is not alot of toxicity to the 
opiates, especially not the more natural derivatives such as opium, heroin, 
and morphine. Today's synthetic opiates are the most toxic, and even they 
aren't much... Alcohol, tobacco, and many, many prescription drugs are 
far more noxious.

As for considering if heroin use were treated like tobacco and 
advertised, which is what I assume is meant by "encouraged"... 

No, I won't. 

I see no reason why the idiocy of our current system should be encouraged by 
giving it that much credibility. IMO, substance use is mostly a personal 
affair, to be made public only as seen fit by individuals, not advertisers.

> I know SO many junkies that would still be using if they 
> could support their habit on a normal salary.

I have yet to meet a junkie that stopped *solely* because the drug cost 
too much money. There are many other costs involved, and they are *all* a 
part of what makes a person stop using.

> But certainly I would agree"legal" drugs have an insidiousness about 
> them that warrants extra caution...because it is still OK in 
> our culture to become addicted to nicotine, the addiciton is that 
> much more easily developed and fed, and less recognizable.

I agree with you here, at least in part...

Let's look at the drugs that are legal here:

alcohol
tobacco
caffeine

What these drugs all have in common is that they are all VERY 
addictive... in fact, I believe that their addictiveness is a large part 
of why they are legal. Two of the three are easily produced here in the 
US, after all... but I'm afraid I don't have the key to the whole 
puzzle... not yet.

-- Another side note to the whole concept of laws making opiates illegal--

The first laws ever passed making opiates illegal in this nation (at least 
west of the Rockies) were passed with the *sole intention* of keeping out 
Chinese immigrant labor... which wasn't exactly a secret; the only form 
of opium made illegal was the *smokable* form, which only the Chinese used. The 
patent-medicine variety was still perfectly acceptable. 

--->
    
Having explored the issues, including your input, I can only include that 
the biggest drug problems of all are:

1) popular ignorance of actual drug effects
2) prohibition
3) lack of a *cultural context* for safe and sane drug use in this country.
   (contact me for info on this issue)



I hope I have saitsfactorily addressed your concerns, Alissa -- if you 
feel a bit singled out, I apologize... it wasn't intended... (hug)

Dear SFRavers:

My apologies to anyone and everyone that I have offended by posting these 
items.

I had only wanted to extend the discussion of parties/drug use to what I 
believe was a logical extension, given that I keep having these 
discussions with other sfr folks *without my bringing them up*.

Any suggestions as to a more appropriate alternate forum that would be 
easy for sfravers to check, as they wish, would be appreciated.

Once again, I'm sorry to have exceeded the scope of this list.

Anyone who goes out with any regularity should know that the venue controls
security and door access, If it were left up to Wicked, just about everyone
would be let in.  Just what are you implying Maui?

We were first in line at Wicked.. and a friend of mine, who had never raved before, and therefore wasn't ready with his ID, was just waved thru, WITHOUT showing
his ID...  ok..ok... we're both old farts and we look it so cut the damned jokes :)

I wonder if their bad attitude is caused by the attitude of some of the clientele or
mebbe they just get pissed off over time...
Anyone know any security folx out there who could give some feedback??

Another important distinction is whe maturity of the user. My
drug phase began around age 14, and (this is open to debate,
of course :) I came out a normal person.

I also know some people with whom I went through that phase
with who didn't.

The point? Generalizations don't work.

Big difference.  Other drugs are illegal to possess or to sell.  No one is
talking about making tobacco illegal to possess or to sell.  The drive is to
get people who are addicted to tobacco to quit.  Would you be against a drive
to get people who are addicted to heroine or speed to quit?

#1 Happy Happy Joy Joy HAS gone off with great Results
#2 It was at Troc and had permits (the case was thrown out of court because
the city violated the permit laws... I have the paper work)
#3 I have not seen you Dave Alga at 4 HHJJ (I only saw you at 2)
#4 By deffinition Underground parties do not usually have permits...
hence"underground"
#5 Diverse City has gone off 2xs in the last year n a half with no problems
which is a pretty good record for an underground event.
#6 I am willing to comp people in for the next party if they feel were
cheated.
I am currently looking for a permitted space because unfortuniatly it is now
the only way to go.  I am not trying to rip any one off in fact I still need
to come up whith lots of money to pay for the sound sys etc.  Even best
parties get busted i.e. Full Moon, Sharron etc.  
Any one who is still not sure off my sincerity is welcome to call the voice
mail number and I will call you back.

Actually.. i think  there was that study that came out a few months
ago that said Movie theatre pocorn WAS a REALLY bad thing,
so maybe another example might be good :) :)

but seriously...
im really having a problem with this whole attitude towards
people who are not as chronologically far along as others...

In most Native American tribes, i believe drug use starts
with the passage into adulthood, and that is usually around what..
14??

okay.. nwo you're going to say, but that is Their culture
where they treat 14 year olds like adults, we don't do that
in OUR culture, so it doesn't apply..

well.. whose culture? i didn't quite realize that there was ONE culture
in the United States that would indicate that you understand the
life situation of someone else well enough to know that they
are an adult by a given age...

cuz people under 14 have: killed other people, had babies, had abortions
had to take care of their brothers and sisters while their parents shot up,
graduated from college and gotten into a predominant med school,
etc. etc. etc.

i dunno.. i'll bet there are quite a few 14 year olds who have gone through
more than most of this list (including myself) will go through in a lifetime

to say that someone who is 14 who you dont know is too "young" to
do something that you feel perfectly fine doing yourself is tripe

cuz honestly.. my father would probably suffer a lot more damage
from taking E than any teenager would...
and i mean from the psychological, not physical effects...

should we try to help people be educated so that they arent taking
things without being as informed as possible?

HELL YES!

but that should be completely regardles of their age

I got this story from a friend of a friend of mine  ;) ;)

There was once a group of four girls, who took E together for the 
first time when they were 14 and 15 years old. They are 24 and 25 now-
two Bryn Mawr graduates, one Yale graduate, one Colgate 
dropout turned Emergency Medical Technician. One is a 
history, english, and music teacher in NYC. One is performing 
anthropological research somewhere in Brasil. One is a 
technical writer who is considering becoming an architect.
Can you guess who the technical writer is? ;)

Each woman in this group can count the number of times that she has 
dosed E on her fingers. YMMV.

I'll agree that the more developed a sense of self you have, the more 
of a base you have to work with, or away from in some moments, or 
towards in others. Sometimes I think we are kidding (and maybe 
denying) ourselves in thinking that the "formative" years stop 
once one becomes an "adult." Do they ever really stop? How many 
30 year olds out there feel that they haven't learned much in 
the past 10 years? 

As an aside, because my mother watched many of her friends, both 
male and female, pass through a "mid-life crisis," she came to 
the conclusion that people are "teenagers" roughly from the age of 12 
until they are 60 or so. 

I think we would be well served to think of aging and maturation 
as non-linear processes. Most people I know can show wisdom well
beyond their age at certain moments and then act completely 
"childish" at other points in time. Again YMMV, but please
don't discredit the youth for seeking out experiences that 
are at least similar to the ones that you value.    

Peace-

Jocelyn

P.S. The technical writer told that friend of a friend of mine that 
it did help her: apparently, she was an only child and a latch-key kid 
from the age of 3 months on. She became such a loner and so 
territorial that she resented it when her parents came home early-
and that at the ripe age of 8. E helped her to share in ways she never 
would have otherwise.

Mijos, how horrible! I'm disgusted! Distraught I say! (or however that's

Disturbing young ravers! We should all know better than that! When a young
person is raving, doctors say, it is VERY DANGEROUS to disturb them. One
should always let them rave on untill they wake up at home, and it will all
seem like a dream to them. 

Some people are never able to overcome this condition, and continue raving
even in later years. They also consider themselves young. This perplexes
doctors everywhere. Except those at raves. Dreaming............

Hi,   A long time ago,  the SFRaves list had a party in Berkeley at Dwight
St.  It was just after the first BLue Cube party,  and I was to be the first
person to spin there.     This was held over at Seth's place in Berkeley.

Seth (acid23@soda.berkeley.edu) no longer has this Email addreess,  nor does
he live in Berkeley.     Does anyone in the SFRaves list know where I can
find him.     Apparently he has moved,   and hasn't returned any of my records.

If anyone knows how to find him,    please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanx

One of the Wicked guys actually went out of his way to try and get a friend
of mine in, but he was stopped by one of the guards.

He (the Wicked promoter) said the Troc has an 18 license, but they'd only
be able to allow 18-21 from 2-6 while there's no alcohol served and then
make sure everyone was out at 6am, causing a major disruption in the party.

i totally agree here.  i think when i said some stuff a while back on 
this topic i referred to "older people in the scene and people with more 
experience with drugs"--or something like that.  I'm 23 and have tons of 
experience with _some_ drugs, but when it comes to others, i turn to my 
more experienced (and usually younger) friends.  In general, though, i 
still think that along very very rough lines it is the responsibility of 
older members of our "community" (if that's what we are!!) to sort of 
keep an eye out for our younger members.  (because they're not likely to 
get any guidelines from parents or school, etc.)  You're totally right 
though, i've seen alot of 15-16 yr olds who are at least as mature about this 
stuff as i am, and alot of 18-20 yr olds who are quite a bit _more_ mature 
than i am about drugs. (Including my little sister.)  
  I think one of the concerns i would have about a 14 yr old getting 
really into e--and this is totally cultural, nothing to do with mental 
maturity--would be that there are some tasks that i got out of the way 
before trying e that i hadn't dealt with at 14: finishing high school, 
leaving home, etc, etc....another concern i have about e and other fun 
drugs is safety, like in situations where you are out and about in the 
city in the middle of the night, either driving or on foot in a sketchy 
area or whatever (situations that come up alot in the typical raver 
lifestyle) but i'm not sure i'm any better equipped to deal with that 
stuff now than i was at 14...

I haven't followed this whole thread...but I tend to think that drug
experience and maturity doesn't have that much to do with age but volumes to
do with personality.  I was fryin balls as Milton would say at 13 and, like
that well known bunny, am still goin at 27.  I wouldn't trade some of those
nights for anything -- they are treasures beyond all my possesions.  I knew
exaclty what Ernie felt when I read what he originally posted because I've
felt it myself, that gut-level pang of concern for a really spun, really
young raver - its one of the most frustrating things about being "old".  But
then I think, would I have listened to *ANYONE* when I was that age?  The
answer is yes, there were one or two older folks whose opinions I respected
more than anyone elses and, though I probably never expressed it, what they
said really did affect me.  If I could only remember what it was they said
and why I listened....

Someone mentioned this awhile back and I've seen the Wicked clan on events
coming up in New York and Miami so it must be true.  Just stop and imagine
for a second what it would be like to go to Wicked in a different city each
time instead of just a different location...maybe like the Dead/P-funk
Mothership Invasion cranked to 11 in an parallel universe?

I'm waiting for the Wicked Week in Jamaica vacation myself:-)

I think phuture summed it all up in his post. It all has to do with each 
individual personality.  I remember when I was a young-un and I would be 
warned about certain things and I would HAVE to experience it anyway 
before I would learn.  Hell, I'm STILL that way now at 25!!:) It all has 
to do with how well you know yourself and your limits.
luv,
Amy

King thurs/fri, being throne of drones/re-immersion. The spots were
actually a track in the side hall, and when you walked on it, drums would
pump ot of the speakers on the side. The security guy at the door was so
enthralled, he kept racing around on it and jammin his arms, smiling like
he didn't carry mace..

No, they was a wall of appliances, set to go off, and spotlighted, and
their sounds amplified as some people went "ahh!" others went "huh?" it
draggen on a little too much for me, but that's just me....

I disagree, wicked chooses these sights with bad security. If it mattered
enough they wouldn't use these venues. Whether it is worth not using those
sights just because of the security is up to wicked, if you feel real
strongly about it leave a message on their voice mail.

        The main concern I'd have with this is how indiscreet she was
acting in what sounds like a public place.  Not only could she get busted,
which is real trouble, or hit up, which can get dangerous -- it would
indicate that she wasn't being properly mentored...  more important with
L than E, but still beginners should be looked after.

Crazy that Thomas played 'Age of Aquarius' at the party, right. I wish I 
could have been there but was at Diverse City till it got busted then 
lacked funds to continue. Anyway, did he play a remix or the original? I 
spent this summer in New York City. In addition to many rocking 
underground parties and legal `raves` I became devoted to Sound Factory 
New York --quite a DIFFERENT club than Sound Factory S.F. . Junior 
Vasquez DJs from open at 2am until 12noon every saturday night. Every week 
he ruthlessly works his, and I do mean his, club down. Yes there is a 
point. Around 11am Junior begins to take the club on a time travel 
journey back in time - exploring the history of dance music. He will play 
70`s rare disco and soul, then always always `The age of Aquarius', then 
sometimes he will even play crazy old stuff like the 50's tune 'Mashed 
potato`. It is incredible to hear some of these tunes over the Factory 
system, you hear parts of them you have never heard before. Hearing that 
Thomas played Aquarius brought that back. Hearing Junior play from 10 
till noon is  some of the most seroius good times I have ever had at a club. 
I hope Thomas worked it as well.

Altho wicked has almost always been at places with the Angry Samoans
performing live at the door: at my very first rave (a wicked) I got slapped
by security right as the crowd pushed forward. But the troc is INSANE! The
space is great, the parking excellent, but the guys at the door have no
sense of humor! The blond/black mess-haired security dude with the
leather/chains kept pulling open the door in the men's toilet stall, even
when only one person was in there legitamately picnching a loaf! 

At the end of wicked, I find my friend outside all curled up. He got kicked
out for a pipe, in the early freezing am, no ride, no jacket, nobody he
knew. It is illegal, but we all agree on where to stuff that...so why use a
venue where the house's opinions differ from ours?
Kept hearing that security there really wants to snort any confiscates, but
that sounds sorta cheap. Must really just be more chest pounding by
gorillas in our midst....

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.........

Mijos, how often do we get that "hey, how are you man? What are you on" or
"I am sooo gone. I took two phat hits....he!he!" it's like a conversation
starter! And now we are gonna knock some 14 year old for following OUR
example? Even if you're respnsible user, you are part of the perceived
problem by attending the same events as the REALLY GONE.

She's just really gone, and friggin lovin it and goin' "lookit me, I'm one
of u, I'm a  raver and I'm on the same stuff as you and wish you were too!"
and that's "our fault" (since were assigning guilt here) .She'll catch on
about what "raving" is about(if she hasn't already), or she'll move on to
some other scene. Like everyone else .Too bad the "older/wiser" of us shy
away from all agers/18+ parties, we never give 'em exposure to our
experiences. There are so many rave legends and myths among them, you can't
believe it: i got "teeny bopper" friends who go "oh, he's a real raver, he
goes to wicked and shit" and who are sooo intimidated by older ravers, they
make it to the full moon and stare in awe at the 21+ crowd. Sunset was
great because that mix started to happen. Maybe we should help 'em use that
E a little better, if they're not already...
 If your concern is about her doing it at 14, with her experimental
joy-ride mentality, she'd be doing something else in a different
environment, maybe a kegger with some less helpful souls around? Glad she
picked Diverse City over Alpha-Kappa, and that she could still enjoy
herself and her friends' company in a parking lot, rather than  projectile
ralphing in the girl's room and wondering who the hell was that guy?
But I babble on...lots

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

Yeah, i'm out here in new jersey planning/hoping to catch garth and 
markie at an event called "Wild Honey" this saturday night.  Right before i 
left (at my last wicked) i heard something vague about "we might be 
out there so keep in touch" but figured it was sort of an up in the air 
sort of idea and not an actual plan...then i randomly got hold of a small 
inexpensively printed flyer (most of the flyers i picked up in new york 
were too big and glossy to even put in my pocket) advertising a "small, 
intimate affair for those who like to dance" with two wicked djs and two 
new york guys...all i've got is the flyer though, and the info number on 
the flyer doesn't say anything about this event, just other i guess 
bigger events that the same people are putting on.  I got the flyer 
several weeks ago and i'm hoping the thing is still happening....
  thanks for confirming that they are actually coming east.  Are they 
booked for any other events in the NY area?  You can e-mail me privately 
if you want--i'm probably the only one who needs to know.  
     thanks!   --jessica

Yeah, once while enjoying a 7 layer burrito at taco bell after a Sunset, 
Mark and I heard Jam + Spoon's "Right in the Night" over the muzak.
He had never heard the song befire, and he couldn't believe that they would
play such a cool song with "positive rave culture" lyrics
at taco bell.

And hey, while I'm talking about Taco Bell...

We also noticed that the colors used in the dining room's decor could
not be described as anything less than "trippy."   Enjoy the fact that
recreational drug users are now being target marketed.  I mean, hey, 
we have money too.

Hi.

I mostly just lurk in this group, but I thought I'd waste time I
really don't have and throw up (figuratively) a comment for consideration.
I get the feeling I might have the minority opinion on this subject, in
this group.

Being the fogey of 31 years I am, an alien to most of the mood enhancing
mixtures of the day, I'd like to warn you all up front that I'm probably
going to sound like Reagan giving a speech about IRQ settings for fax
modems, but tough.

Specifically, I'd have to point my old-world thinking at Mr. Andrew Knutsen
who, citing a comment about 14-year-olds "high on E" says,

> Sounds like she was living her youth and having a good time... 
> Maybe people should be more critical of themselves, before they 
> go judging other people.


14 is kinda young for playing with drugs. I'm not saying it'll sentence
you to the life of a useless wastoid or condemn you to eternal damnation.
It's just kinda young.

This has nothing to do with the ability of that person to make a choice.
I make different decisions now than I would have at 14, and I expect
when I'm 48 I'll be able to say the same thing about 31.

But at 14, you're still battling the throes of pubescence, and your mind
is still forming. Chemicals that might later just fry a few unused brain
cells may significantly inhibit your development.

I know there are arguments about this. I'm sure there are a thousand people
who could pull up lots of statistics about human development, and quote
those the inevitable comparisons to alcohol, smoking, red meat, and
watching Geraldo, but please don't bother.

Consider feeding drugs to an infant. It's pretty unthinkable to most people.
Now consider leaving those drugs out for a seven-year-old. Not too many
people would go for that. The kid is old enough ingest drugs on his/her own,
but doesn't fully understand the issues and is still very much in his/her
formative stages. Any good parent will be wary of ANY drugs--prescribed,
recreational, and PC (e.g. coffee)--given to their children during
these years.

I think it's safe to say that most people believe there's an age that is
too young for drugs. It's mostly our definition of "too young" that varies.
But to mosey back to the point . . .

> Sounds like she was living her youth and having a good time... 
> Maybe people should be more critical of themselves, before they 
> go judging other people.

That sounds like more of a personal judgment than the guy who was
expressing a healthy concern for a 14-year-old. Of course, that's
just my opinion. It could be based on poor judgment.

In any case, I've heard that having kids and raising them for ten years
is apt to change one's perspective on this subject.  Me, I believe that.

:::sigh:::

I guess I'm getting old.  I hope this isn't a first step on the road to
boxer shorts and dentures.  Oh well.  I think I'll go wax my elbows.


Yours in social and corporeal decay,

Greg

What?!  No one can be allowed into the Troc after 6am if they are 18-20?  
(Doesn't make sense.)

        I'd just like to point out that the quote below is from the message
I was responding to...  I hate getting caught in mailing-list crossfire...
Ironically, my point was somewhat similar to Gregs (though I'm 36 and have
only abstained once or twice).

Yeah, and how bout that ad campaign?  "Summer's short--stay up late."  I 
think someone put out a flyer for a party inspired by the taco bell ad, 
shortening it to "Summer's short--stay up." (Late night munchies, anyone?) 
The moral is, hey look! we're being targeted.  Another funny thing was when a friend of 
mine tried to convince me that Frutopia (Sugar-based fruit drink produced 
for Coca-Cola Company) was cool because "it says cool shit on the 
label."  yeah, thanks to somebody with a degree in advertising and gen-x 
culture... :) --jessica

No, it is not the same John Lee.  John S. Lee of SFR fame would
not be caught dead in _Wired_ (or so I believe after his strongly
disparaging comments he was making about the magazine last spring).

P.S.  It doesn't even look like the same guy, either.

Ak! 31 isn't old! You're scaring me--my 24th birthday is next week and 
i've spent the past month reminding myself that "mid-twenties" is nowhere 
near over _any_ hill, and now you're calling yourself a fogey at 31?  I

The latest INTERNET INVASION UPDATE (Love the all-caps) was just posted 
on alt.rave...if you're interested it's there, but i vote we don't

happy birthday, but im 22 and im way old..
cant stay up too much past 10 pm now..
go to clubs and just hear a bunch of racket.. not music
my head is constantly aching
and oy! does my back hurt

:)

seriously though, i feel a lot older when i go visit my parents
and see their friends children who i babysat and what not
and i think "My how they've grown"
(although id be damned if i said that cuz i hated (still do)
when my grandparetns said (say) stuff like that)

of course saying getting chronologically advanced means getting to bed
(and getting up) earlier and not staying out all night
can all put to rest in Two Words: (well One technically)

It would really suck.
Having "done" the frat party thing a few times 
recently I've seen the grotesque things alcohol does to people who are 
obnoxious in the first place.
I agree:  better a rave on E at 14 than a frat house. At least I can 
trust ravers.  Frat boys are infamous for one thing in particular-- 
rape; and it usually all starts at the tapping of the keg.
Better to set an example of responsible drug-use than scorn that which we 
all (for the most part) condone for ourselves.

At this moment, there are very few venues in the city that have appropriate
cabaret liscenses to allow 18+, most of these venues are in use during the
nights that Wicked wants to have a party.  If you don't think this is true,
then I challenge you to suggest some venues that can hold the Wicked 
crowd, that permits can be obtained and that the party is guranteed bust free,
this last part is important, the police even came to the troc a couple of times
and hassled them about the volume.

  There have been a lot of different opinions regarding drug use and the 
age of the user, but the image I saw just didn't seem right.  It wasn't 
even the fact that she was very young, but that she said "...and if your 
high on drugs, your happy anyways!"  This can be true, but I've seen too 
many people 'just experimenting' have very bad experiences.  A friend of 
mine tried E for the first time in London and she flipped out because it 
was too intense for her.  How would our young raver react if it was a bad 
dose of E?  Not everyone has access to the information we do...

  I have quite a few friends in high school who rave on the weekends and 
manage to get their work done.  Some of them use speed to help them rave, 
and then to help them to get their homework done.  This really bothers me 
since I hate speed and I've seen too many people ruined by it... How does 
this relate to a 14 year old raving high on E? Well, if at 14 she's 
trying E, what else is she going to try? If being on high drugs makes you 
happy, why not do them more often?

  If there was a 14 year old who was educated about drugs and was mature 
about them, then I don't have a problem with the choices they make.  But 
if you're un-educated (at ANY age) then odds are you are going to make 
some bad decisions (which could have been avoided.)

  Anyways, I just hate to see good people and good friends be ruined by 
drugs.  I also know a LOT of people who have been helped by drugs as 
well, but I get sick of the "I need to be high to dance" and the "Get 
high, get laid" attitudes I see at parties.  Granted, it could be worse, 
but still...

Peace out and rave on and on and on and on...

-Ernie

I gotta come out in defense of the troc though its easy to bash.

The troc is a very alternative venue and I've been known to visit it 3 or
4 times in one week because they don't shy way from less than mainstream
events.   Some things I like about it:

1. Parking - I always find parking on bryant, 4th or the alley way on the
   side.  True, midweek you have to watch out for the midnight street
   cleaning, but its easy to figure out if you remember that the next day
   starts at midnight.

2. The sound is excellent and so is the lighting system.

3. A chill space upstairs with sushi no less.

4. I've never been to a bad event at the troc.  Absolutely never.  Every
   rave i've been too, every bondage-a-go, every industrial show, and even a
   gwar show has always left me satisfied. 

I've never been hassled by security, but a couple of the guys give off a
cold aura.  I don't know, I may be used to it by now and they may recognize
me. 

I'm very sorry I didn't make it to Wicked (I twas in LA) but I'm sure it
went off well.  I would definitely go to any future raves there.

I do think it is an "age thing".  My first reaction was "wow, 14" and
I did feel kinda weird when I've seen young ravers obviously high on
E or A. But then as I look back on MY youth (I'm 38, an ancient), I smoked
my first pot at 12 (but didn't get high) and had my first dose at 14
which was administered by a group of very loving people in Central Park
NY during the christmas season of 1970.  It was one of the best things
that ever happened to me.  Now I can't say that it didn't alter my path in life
and I must admit that things were not quite the same afterwards, but
I've always felt that my first "guides" acted responsibly and lovingly,
(I must admit I was an exceptional 14 year old :). So then what is the 
difference?  The parties that I've been to have had an even more safe, loving
and secure vibe, then that christmas in New York way back when.

I'd rather have my son/daughter dose in a responsible manner then start
smoking or drinking any day.

	Ahh, this seems to be the heart of this matter (at least in my 
own little head). Is she doing the e to say "look at me, I am one of 
you"? To be included? This seems a tad on the heading toward the 
spiraling vortex down into the hell-pits of your mind... Granted as 
Milton mentioned, I (and many others) do start a conversation by 
commenting on my/our drugs. But I do not feel that friendships based on 
a few common drug experiences (hmmm, let me rephrase that, a few drug 
experiences that occurred at a common point in time) are worth too much. 
In my own experience, they tend to be strained with little or no common 
ground except the fact that we both dropped an e on this night, this 
other night, this night.... Great, so we can sit aound and blab about a 
few moments in the galaxy of experience.
	But is this, "look at me, I want to fit in" something to be poked 
at and placed on the wrong side of our nice little abritary lines? Was 
this even going on in the incident  (I have prompted it to an 
incident, it would seem) and how can we tell when it is. Should we tell 
when it is? Can you >teach< someone responsibility? Teach, in my opinion, 
no. Set in a direction that might bring them there faster, maybe, it all 
depends on how well you get to know the person. Hmmm, but how can one get 
to know someone if they are dosing e to fit in, so that they do not have 
to fit in because of who they are... Hmmm, in some cases, it does give 
one an idea of who you are... Hmmm, that seems to be a double edged 
sword, I can argue it either way. Hmmmppp, well that lead a long way only 
to end up at the same damn point as when I started (that seems to be a 
reccuring phenomena in my life...)

I have to say, from the point of view of someone who "worked the door" at the 
troc for part of the night.  That the security at the Troc compared to
the King street Security from Hell were pussy cats.  First of all the security
at the Troc doesn't have a steroid problem like some of the guys at King street
obviously have.  They may have been rude to people but I didn't see it.
I even had an under age friend try to get in by being up from and straight with
the guy at he door, he treated her with respect but didn't let her in.

As far as pipes and the lot, well thank your local SFPD, unlike Berkeley where
the city council has informed the police force that Pot bust are to have the 
lowest priority, the City of San Francisco is actively trying to snuff out the
all night party scene in legal venues.  Part of the tactics is that if 
undercovers make an arrest INSIDE the club, the club is fined heavily and 
threatened with loss of liscense.  Most club owners take the fines out of the 
pay of the security people to give them an incentive to keep incidents
to a minimum.  I know the troc has kicked people out, but guess what,
people at king street HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE COPS, searched and if found 
with more incriminating substances, BUSTED! No shit!

People have to realize that it is getting extremely difficult to have a legal
and permitted party in San Francisco without hassles because the City Government
is really down on it.  Instead of complaining, to wicked, (who can't do
anything about the venue's security) Why not complain to your supervisor
(if you know who the are) and tell them to tell the cops to put more effort
on going after violent criminals.  I might add that if anyone knows of a place
that is fully permitted with the appropriate cabaret liscenses to go all night,
in a neighborhood where you can TURN IT UP, speak up, I'm sure Wicked would
love to know about it.

I'm getting tired of reading about Wicked should be 18+ blah, blah...
There are plenty of parties that are 18+ and in only 3 years the person 
who's 18 will be 21 anyway so what's the big deal? I like to go to parties
that are 21+ myself. I also like parties like Basics that are 18+. 
Sometimes parties that are 18+ turn into mostly 18 - 21 parties, and being
almost 39 I feel like I'm out of my element. 

Wicked was so much fun. My first thought when I heard it was at the Troc
was "Oh no, I hate that place". But it was perfect.

Oh!!  By the way,   I had posted a query,  looking for Seth 
(acid23@soda.berkeley.edu).    This Email is no longer valid.
Does anyone know him?   He had hosted an SFRave party between
the first and 2nd Blue Cube party quite a while ago.

Thanx

Subject: Newt's remarks in *FAVOR* of freedom for the Internet
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello,

Here is speaker-elect Newt Gingrich's remarks on Friday, 11/11/94 
describing his support for freedom of information, and for an acceleration 
of the transition to an information based society.

Note that Juan Atkins, the father of techno, got the term "techno" from 
Alvin Toffler's book "Future Shock"...

[the following is an unedited excerpt from the full talk]

------------------------------------begin included excerpt----------------

        Third ... this happened by  pure  happenstance  two  days
ago...  that  I  will  share with you. People have been trying to
figure out how to put me in a box, and it is very hard because  I
don't  fit  boxes very well. Probably...and therefore I must be a
hypocrite...you know if you watch the Washington press  coverage,
some  of  it verges on the bizarre. The best description of me is
that I am a conservative futurist. Mariann and I have for a  long
time been friend with Alvin and Heidi Toffler, authors of "Future
Shock" and "The Third Wave." We really  believe  it's  useful  to
think about the 21st century.

        On the other hand I  believe  the  most  powerful  single
doctrine  for  the  leadership  of  human  beings  and  for their
opportunity to pursue happiness is  the  Federalist  Papers,  the
Toqueville  Travels  and Democracy in America, the Declaration of
Independence, and the American Constitution. So on the one hand I
recommend   to   all  Congressional  staffs  Druckers  "Effective
Executive," Demmings "Concepts  of  Quality,"  look  at  the  new
Progress  and  Freedom  Foundation's  report  on  Alvin Toffler's
works, and that will help you in one direction.

        In  the  other  direction  I  suggest  to  them,  immerse
yourself  in  the  Founding  Fathers. These people thought a long
time about the nature of  being  human,  about  the  problems  of
power,  about  how to organize a free society so it could sustain
freedom. And if you can combine the two, you can begin to  create
an  opportunity  for  every  American to participate in ways that
will prove to be quite remarkable.

        Now, that obviously doesn't fit  anybody's  current  word
processor.  There is no "Newt Gingrich, conservative futurist," -
it doesn't exist yet. Therefore it has to be something else,  and
so  they  keep  trying  to  say,  well, are you going back to the
eighties, or are you doing this - no, we're in fact trying to get
to  the  21st  century, and we want to do so in a way that's very
effective.

        There are five large changes we have  to  go  through.  I
will   be   teaching   a   course,   called   "Renewing  American
civilization," at Reinhard College in January, which is  designed
to  outline  these  changes in some detail. It takes about twenty
hours, so I am obviously not going to give them to you today. But
I want to just describe the five changes very briefly to give you
a taste of what they are because I  think  they  are  central  to
everything  that  will be organizing our activities over the next
two years.

        First, we have to accelerate the transition from a Second
Wave  mechanical bureaucratic society to a Third Wave information
society, to use Alvin Toffler's model. Two simple examples:  one,
imagine  the speed and ease with which you use a bank teller card
anywhere on the planet and electronically verify your account and
get  money,  and  then  call  the federal government about a case
(laughter). There is no objective  reason  that  institutions  of
government  have  to be two or three generations behind the curve
in information systems and management, but  they  are.  And  that
means,  for  example,  if  we're  really  serious  about distance
medicine, and about distance learning and about distance work, we
could  revolutionize  the  quality  of life in rural America, and
create the  greatest  explosion  of  new  opportunity  for  rural
America ever in history.

        And  yet,  we  currently  are  moving  in  the   opposite
direction.  So  at a time when the IRS should be making it easier
to have a home office, they make it harder. Now  that's  foolish.
It is exactly the wrong direction.

        Second. The second example I am going to give you is:  we
will  change the rules of the House to require that all documents
and all conference reports and all  committee  reports  be  filed
electronically  as  well  as  in writing, and that they cannot be
filed until they are available to any citizen who wants  to  pull
them up simultaneously, so that information is available to every
citizen in the country at the same moment that it's available  to
the  highest  paid  Washington  lobbyist.  That will change, over
time, the entire flow of information, and the entire  quality  of
knowledge  in  the country, and it will change the way people try
to play games with the legislative process.

Hi All,

At this point, let's not disturb Milton anymore than we absolutely have
to-The "Young Wanker" (Brian Mcgonigle's phrase) is DISTURBED enough!!!!!

Having just added another gray-hair to this hoary head-(43 years old) and
having smoked marriage-e-wanda at a  Donovan Concert in 1966- the grizzled
voice of experience rises,(albeit slowly)--and echoes  Alice in Wonderland
 as she says,

"I always give myself very good advice, but I very rarely follow it."

These "disturbing young ravers," are US, exactly like US,
and are no different than we ARE or WERE. The perception that that
 circumstances are suddenly different , or these young  people are  suddenly
different than US,  is the mistaken notion.


Not only are we, as human beings stubbornly adverse to accepting the advice
of others, but we remain defiantly obstinate in recognizing the value of our
own, painfully learned lessons.

But,  you know you're getting older, when you start giving others "free"
advice-(and shuttering at the moral recalcitrance
of youth)  Imagine my grin as I hear those folks wrestle with getting older
at --24,25,27,31, and thank God Geoff!!!!! (38).

I think it is well to consider here  a definition of morality that includes
the granting of those same freedoms to others, that we give so freely to
ourselves.....

.While tolerance does not mean aceptance or encouragement, I remind you that
the population 13-15 is also the age when most teenagers are now beginning to
have sex, smoke, and drink.

 WE lose sight of the fact,  that until the 20th century (this century), men
and women married at twelve, had children, and died before age 30.

(If I were alive then, I would have been dead for 13 years!!!!)

 It seems we can't achieve a ripened maturity without the indulgences and
mistakes that youth is heir to. However, it is adults who persist in their
folly, and think it is possible to substitute experience, or laws, FOR
maturity and the process of making mistakes.

"The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom" quoth William Blake.

I think the best we can hope for, is to be able to run the gauntlet of youth
(doing drugs, having sex, drinking, tobacco,etc.)  passing GO, collecting
$200.00 dollars, and learning by the painful process of trial and error,
 until  by sheer force of luck, we become OLDER.

Remember,  there is  nothing that people give away more freely, than advice.
"Conception is a blessing, but when it comes to your daughter, look to
it"-Hamlet)

Even without this asking for advice, "if a fool persist in his folly, he will
become wise." 

 The trick is, let's all just hope we can stay out of the way of the fool and
his folly,(disturbing young ravers on E) and get home safely in time for
dinner.

                                              Robertj............Monterey

Gang, *please*:

Can we cut down on the off-topic posts?  I already tried to shuffle one
off-topic conversation somewhere else, so I'm going to try it again so I
can't be accused of singling out anyone.  The volume on this list is *huge*,
and the quality gets diluted when people don't think about relevance before
posting.  There are other mailing lists for talk about politics, about
smoking, about just about every topic.  The 14-year-old-girl-on-e thread was
for the most part on topic as it started out as a conversation about an
experience at a party here, but even then it diverged into alt.drugs areas. 
If mail queues were tree-shaped rather than linear (mail filters help) then
maybe it would be more manageable, but right now it's obscene. 

Please respect the mail boxes of the 400 people who have allowed you to write
to it.  Thanks, and sorry to have to sound like such a dweeb.

	Brian

"'tis true, 'tis pity, and pity 'tis... 'tis true" (Willy S. on another drunken
occasion :).. 

However, many problematic and difficult times that I encountered in my 10s/20s and solved through "unaided reason" could have been solved much more quickly and easily if I had realized that these problems had been solved before.. many times before..and many generations/centuries before... 

Only thru' experience can one gain wisdom.... however many of us have learned
from our mistakes/experiences.. and even though we may be doomed to be ignored..it may, however, be our duty (and sometimes a privelege) to impart what little wisdom we have garnered in our growth... If you can stop one other person making a mistake that you made...shit, it's worth it :)

I read in Project X magazine that her stuff is kind of Bubble-gum techno,
but I haven't heard it yet.  I imagine this is very much for real, although
probably not very realistic.  If she pulls it off though, more power to her.

a frat kegger on E?

I went to a frat party where the theme was "Blacklight." (seriously)  
A room full of clean-cut, good looking young men wearing white sorts and 
T-shirts and covered in glowing paint, drinking crap beer and self 
conciously 
dancing to a DJ who played... wailing diva garage house?  Except for all 
the women there, I could've sworn I was at a gay club.  I felt like the 
DJ was playing a big inside joke on the frat boys, making them dance to 
drag queen anthems (and frat boys *have* to dance, because "the chicks 
will leave if we don't" -real quote), and I was the only one who got it.  
I had to keep telling myself, "don't dance with the boys" over and over, 
but the experience was really fun, but only cause I got to laugh so hard 
at people who would probably beat me up if they knew what I was thinking.

love,
whitsitt

Really?  I have been at ones with Ghost, and I've seen him 
pissed off twice when his set was cut off by the police.  
Police don't usually contribute to a good vibe...

2)

Look more carefully next time.

You can throw an underground party with permits.  Ask Kevin and 
Jerry from Funky Tekno Tribe.

I'm not accusing you of throwing parties that aren't good...  
HHJJ has been very fun in the past, but it has always gotten 
busted when I'm there.  I just don't think it's smart to throw 
a party against something like Cool World and get everyone's 
hopes up to go to something that is more "underground" and 
"less expensive", when it's just going to get busted.

confession of a high school hessian

I, too, witnessed Thomas slaying away with "Back in Black."
  Boy did that take me back!  AC/DC was my favorite band in high school.  
 I still have almost every album they put out.  AC/DC at Long beach arena
 in 1988 was the first live show I ever saw- what a freak fest!  Denim 
jackets covered with patches, hair everywhere, and me and my friends up
 in the third balcony, stoned as fuck, banging our heads like there was
 no tomorrow.  Seemed like Angus Young never ran out of energy; we 
figured either he was tweeked on pounds of crank, or the PMRC was right 
and he actually was possessed by satan.  I named my cat Angus in his honor.

With all due respect, Roxanne, this seems really ELITIST to me. I'm sorry
to hear that you're bored with the topic, but to some of us it's VERY
important, regardless of age.

>There are plenty of parties that are 18+ and in only 3 years the person 
>who's 18 will be 21 anyway so what's the big deal?

Have you considered the fact that three years is a LONG time when you're 18
years old? That's the difference between a senior in high school and a
junior in college (or three years into the workforce). It's also longer
than a lot of clubs, jobs and marriages last.

>I like to go to parties that are 21+ myself. I also like parties like Basics
>that are 18+. 

Gee, that's convenient. Some folks don't have the luxury of choosing from
among so many options.

Personally, I am NEVER comfortable in a public gathering that discriminates
on the basis of age, and try to avoid them whenever possible. I don't like
the idea of buying into a nightlife caste system. (Not that I can really
"blame" club promoters - they make most of their money on booze, and the
law makes it really difficult to serve alcohol at all without turning away
-21ers at the door. There are also curfew laws to consider).

>Sometimes parties that are 18+ turn into mostly 18 - 21 parties, and being
>almost 39 I feel like I'm out of my element.

And yet, unlike minors, you are still *welcome*. How would you feel if half
the parties in the Bay Area became 21-30 instead of 21+, even to the point
of turning you away at the door? 

Don't get me wrong: I don't mean to say that 21+ = fascism or something.
But despite what grog-peddling club owners will tell you, all-ages parties
CAN happen in the city. We've been putting them on at Komotion for eight
years. The only people who have to show ID to get into our parties are the
police.

Hope to see ALL of you (even the 14-year-old from Diverse City) at the next
Friends & Family.

I would like to ask what is the difference between a 21+ party and an all
white party. It seems most of us have agreed that maturity is based on
experience not on how old you are. Yeah there is a law for clubs that you
have to be 21+, but there was once a law that you had to be white to go
certain places & I know this scene would not support such a law if it were
still in effect. The only difference I see is that one is something you're
born with and stays the same, and the other changes through time, but both
are discriminating nonetheless. I have been going to parties for almost 3
years now and whenever a wicked or community comes up I have to stay home
while all my friends go out (most of my friends have been 21+ the whole
time), why because I'm younger, allthough I may be more mature than alot
of people over 21 it's the rule & I've still got two years left before I
turn 21. I have very few choices of parties to go to & I'm very demanding
when it comes to the music, other than the wicked guys Spun & Josh are
pretty much the only guys I realy like. I JUST WANT TO DANCE!. I'm very
interested about what other sfravers think of this subject.

I agree totally! That's a very discriminating rule. Us underage ravers 
are denied the right to attend good parties. The all age ones are good 
and everything, but it's not like they happen all the time.

Wicked's parties don't get broken up?  Does the FULL MOON sound 
familiar?  Don't get me wrong, they're great parties (although 
the past 4 or 5 I have been to have started at about 6 in the 
morning, and haven't lasted more than 10 minutes).  I have been 
to and played at every Cool World since they started, and not 
one has gotten broken up.

Well, blurry vision should come in handy for this, cuz the laws 
pertaining to our situation are indeed quite fuzzy...

Basically, Komotion has always operated on the premise that we are not a 
bar, nor a "place of public entertainment." The fire inspector defined this
as an establishment which a) holds public events on a regular basis,
b) advertises, c) charges admission (as opposed to "donation"), and
d) sells alcohol.

According to the ABC Commission, we are a non-profit arts organization that 
irregularly throws parties, at which we take donations and sell beer/wine to
those over 21. We are also a recording studio, which means we sometimes use
the space for recordings of bands, DJs etc. where a live audience is desired.
(The last Friends & Family party, for example, was both).

Basically, that's how we do it. The main reason clubs don't operate in this
manner is that they want to sell hard liquor, which yields a much higher profit
than selling beer. To do that, you need a liquor license and operate either a
bar (no minors admitted) or a restaurant (all ages, but must also serve food).

Could we please take this to e-mail?

Hello again.


It figures.  I speak up once an eon and I totally botch it when I do.

Sorry, Andrew, about misquoting you.

By the way, that was just an opinion for consideration I submitted.
I hope it wasn't really interpreted as shooting at someone.  I'll try
to be more careful with names and more detached with terminology in the
any future stuff I probably won't have time to say.

Pardon my faux pas.  Chalk it up to senility.

And speaking of digression, one thing I hope we can all agree on
is that anyone who is old enough to choose to die for his/her country
is old enough to make every other choice a citizen is entitled to
make--*especially* the choices that involve intoxicants.


Pardon me, what was I talking about again?

Wait a minute here...for one thing, i think when whoever it was who said 
"wicked not cool world" used the name "wicked" they probably meant the 
regular monthly "Wicked" and not the FMP.  And i don't know which FMPs 
you went to but it seems like you had particularly bad luck.  I've missed 
the last 3 because i've been out of town, but i know for certain that 
before that there was a long string of really excellent ones that started 
*late* yes but before six, and went on and on.  I don't know much about 
cool world --my only experience was that world groove thing 
that happened this summer--but i must say that IMHO it sucked--i felt 
totally ripped off and cheated because it was expensive and unlike some 
people in the scene i'm not loaded with funds for raving, and on top of 
that the "vibe" was totally nonexistent, with the exeption of about the 
last 30 minutes, thanks to Jeno" and the thinned-out crowd.  
  I would rather go to a 10 minute long FMP at 6 am any day...but luckily 
most of my FMP experiences have been more like 4am-noon, and filled with 
the "community and togetherness" vibe that keeps me coming back again and 
again and which, incidentally, is one of the main reasons i'm blowing off 
graduate school to move back to the bay area...i'd better go before i get 
any more cheesy and sentimental...seey'all at the december full moon, and 
have fun at the one this friday!

noww... i think im just in a bitchy critical mood,
because mind you, i hate her music, and really DONT want her to be 
at the orbital show wanking on stage,
BUT i just have a problem with treating her like this
just because of her active and public sexuality

cuz i think women's sexuality is something that has interesting
dimensions in rave culture...
while on one hand, baggy hip-hop clothes which
are not sexy in a sense of being form fitting or revealing
are very popular,

so is clothing that IS revealing or tight fitting and what not
and while lots of women like raves because they dont have to deal
with their sexuality and can be in baggy clothes, and without makeup
or maybe even feel safer to run around in less clothing 
cuz its easier, cooler or whatever to dance like that

there are also lots of women who enjoy raves cuz they CAN
express their sexuality, but dont feel like it will be
taken in the same way as it might at a normal club

(all of this is obviously a bunch of generalizations
which would not hold up in all or any circumstances
but do seem to me to have occured at some point in time :)

just thoughts

So "going up against Cool World" is inadvisable, huh?  Perhaps, if you're
putting on a commercial event.  But I have been to two CW events and
I will not, absolutely, under any circumstances, ever attend another one.
If someone happens to throw another party on the same night, whether
"underground" or "commercial," and I'm in town, I'll definitely go to
the latter, even if I run afoul of the door policy as I did at the Troc
last Saturday night.  And I'm not whining about that, really, as that's
the breaks of the game as I play it.

The last Cool World production I went to was in the summer of 1993 on that
windswept empty lot down along 3rd Ave.  It was crowded, hot and windy,
the sound in the various areas ranged from mediocre to atrocious, and the
whole thing was ginned up in typical big-rave fashion with a bunch of
hype flimflam about circus rides and go go dancers (and I don't mean the
Chuck Brown type of "go go").  Plus the flyer, a huge four page foldout
with the usual "rave" colors and umpteen phone numbers, was nearly a word
for word ripoff of a recent Universe gig in the UK.  Universe -- now there's
a crew that could pull off a big party.

For the DJs, CW events may be a good paying gig.  It was fun for the half
hour I got to see Carlos spin in the big tent, although it was overrun
with clueless frat boys dragging their chicks through the crowd or looking
for ones willing to be dragged.  (Sorry, I'm down bigtime on that whole
scene, and no apologies.)  But for us customers, it was a drag.

I left at 3 am (which is nearly always my *arrival* time), and vowed never
to return.

For those who see this as having "an attitude", sorry, I plead guilty.
The summer 1993 Cool World cemented my determination to help the underground
stay underground.

I would like to ask what is the difference between a 21+ party and an all
white party. It seems most of us have agreed that maturity is based on
experience not on how old you are. Yeah there is a law for clubs that you
have to be 21+, but there was once a law that you had to be white to go
certain places & I know this scene would not support such a law if it were
still in effect. The only difference I see is that one is something you're
born with and stays the same, and the other changes through time, but both
are discriminating nonetheless. I have been going to parties for almost 3
years now and whenever a wicked or community comes up I have to stay home
while all my friends go out (most of my friends have been 21+ the whole
time), why because I'm younger, allthough I may be more mature than alot
of people over 21 it's the rule & I've still got two years left before I
turn 21. I have very few choices of parties to go to & I'm very demanding
when it comes to the music, other than the wicked guys Spun & Josh are
pretty much the only guys I realy like. I JUST WANT TO DANCE!. I'm very
interested about what other sfravers think of this subject.

Dave:

FMR is not what I was referring to.. I was referring to the choices 
available on that particular nite, i.e., Cool World, Wicked or Diverse City.
In my not so humble opinion, WICKED is by far a better choice than Cool World. 
Also... If u show up at a FMR .. u probably know it's going to get busted..
and that's probably ok since it's free... and u know the score...

I've only been to 1 Cool World (at the Cow Palace) and I've been to many-many
Wickeds (not FMRs)... EVERY Wicked was better than that ONE Cool World...mainly 
because of the shitty Cow Palace!

As far as u raving for only 10 minutes at the last 4-5 Wickeds... well that
sounds like a personal problem with the ego... some persona versus shadow thang,
perhaps ? :) or mebbe something with a slight tint of green in it? :)

funny, when we got there,(2:00ish), we got royal 
treatment-civil ID check,
no pat-down, and smiles from everyone. Troc is famous for tight 
security, we agree,
but we've always found that we party in a secure environment 
there because of it.
perhaps a smile and an iota of respect for the responsibility 
that the door goons
assume would get some respect returned...attitudes tend to be  
"comes around
goes around" type situations...sorry to flame, but we had a 
great time, saw and met tons of people,some of whom had to pay 
for 2 parties to get one, and appreciated the security.really 
spun, really safe, really happy, like it's s'posed to be.

WICKED SLAMMED ! ! ! !
An 8-1/2 on a scale of 10
Haven't seen much better since Psychic T.V. played Floppy's
anybody remember that?

what about some of those Berkeley venues?
Berkeley Square  was alwaya good, albeit small...there must be 
others...
it's true about pot bust priorities being low in berkeley, but 
i'd bet that doesn't extend 
to venue owners or their permits-respect and common sense 
dictate discretion.
how do we know? never been busted,anywhere, for this,or any 
other consentual
act.

the laws as i understand them goes as follows....

1. alcohol cannot be served from 2 am to 6 am anywhere in a public 
establishment. (hence last call at 1:40)

2. Any place that sells alchol is 21+ unless they sell a certian ammount 
of food (ie the troc has a sushi bar) and then they can be 18+.  Also if 
they can close off the entire alcohol serving area so you can't see it 
and noone has access to it...then you can allow all ages...

3. i am not sure about the status of the 18-21 curfew law...but i believe 
it has been taken care of for now.

4.  komotion being a private party falls under completely different rules.  

[a note- alcohol and clubs are about one thing MONEY! If the clubs really 
wanted *everyone* to come then they would find a way to entirely close off 
their bars and do all ages events...but making big bucks from the bars 
is *WAY* too profitable...20 buck admission is not enough money to make 
in one night...also the fines associated with getting caught with having 
someone -21 in your place are again big bucks...with possible loss of the 
liecence (more big bucks) so that is why not carding is ineffectuve]

any questions? susie (:

p.s. you may wonder why i even care about this topic being 22...i have 
lived in this city since birth and my dad use to be a cabaret producer 
(anyone ever see "A Party of One"?) and i wasn't allow in to the show 
because i was only 16...and it wasn't about drinking it was about wanting 
to see my dads show...and then i got into techno and clubbing...and well 
it is all history from there... (:

Neither do DJs who get pissed off in my opinion, if you are spinning when a

I don't know if I would consider a party like FTT 'underground'.  One of
the easiest parties to find when they have 4 or 5 phone numbers and print
thousands of fliers.  Underground goes a lot deeper than just having
permits or not having permits.  How about the way the event is "promoted"
and how the event is put on, where it is thrown, and how easy it is to get
there...

No it's not smart to throw a party going against a big commercial "rave".
Bacause if you are throwing one for that reason then it's the wrong reason.
I'm sure that some organizers don't have the intention knowing they will
get more people if there party is more underground and less expensive.
"when it's just going to get busted." is a hard statement to make
considering even permitted parties get busted.  Unless of course it get's
busted because someone knows why it got busted, maybe some evil doing?
Anyway flame out.

	Hiya.

	For some MBONE information you can take a look at:

	http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/thigpen/html/multicast.html

	It's a really cool new protocol and easy to install (as far
	as kernels go) and yes it is free. Here are some ftp sites:

	 	parcftp.xerox.com/pub/net-research/
		gregorio.stanford.edu/vmtp-ip/
		genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/mbone
		ee.lbl.gov/

	Have fun and good luck!

	PS: My MOO with a special tck/tk client accesses the MBONE.
	    In the near future: multicasted techno. Rave MOO opening
	    soon (well, maybe soon)

Anybody out there interested in going with/carpooling?
I'll probably bring my dog (depending on the site) and will want to 
snooze for a few hours before going out...maybe 3ish?

Call my house @510-436-6067 (I won't be at work tomorrow to collect 
email)

> does anyone out there know where MBone is stashed away on the net?

First, take a look at 
	http://www.eit.com/techinfo/mbone/mbone.html
this is a good starting point for MBONE related queries, includes
pointers to the MBONE FAQ, and the prevalent MBONE software from LBL
'nv'  (a "tuner" for MBONE audio and video conferences) and 'vat'
(MBONE video and audio player).

and Hank Hughes repl'd:

You must be a TCL programmer -- you use unix "kernel" and  "easy to
install" in the same breath. :-)

It may be easier than you think to install MBONE on certain machines
and O/S's because they already include support for multicast IP -- I
know that Irix 5.2 includes multicast (they use it for some of their
own tools, e.g. the InPerson conferencing/shared-whiteboard system,
which is even cooler than MBONE if you're just interested in doing this
kind of stuff over a LAN). Anyways, on platforms supporting multicast
IP, you should be able to install and run MBONE clients w/o doing
anything special.

Most other major unix manufacturers "recent" OSs also include multicast
IP as well, e.g. supposedly Solaris 2.4, with others following suit
soon. If you're running SunOS, kernel patches are available. But note
that corporate firewalls and MIS pinheads may prevent multicast onto
the internet even if  you can do it on your LAN.

Also, multicast for the PC can't be that far off as the company that
does that "Chameleon" windows TCP/IP "product" just announced they'd
provide a PC version of SGI's InPerson.

Now why is it just going to get busted if it's running against cool
world. Underground parties dont always get busted, are you saying that if
they run against you guys they will. You wouldn't know anything about that now
would you Dave.

iSCREW age discrimination! We should all know (or unknow) better. Sunset
was the best thing all summer long, and we all know it was the younger
crowd that gave it so much love and energy. They are generous, creative,
loving people that COME TO DANCE! Some parties can't be 18+? Ok, so some
laws apply. "You" don't want to go to an all ager? You need to be talked
to, mijo. My Unknown friend, I want you to come play in our sandbox. Just
bring yer pail and a smile, let's kick this Full Moon castle in the air!

ok, milton tells me the last few have been sloppy, so i take back some 
(but not all) of the laudatory comments about FMPs.  I guess full moons 
are one of those things where if it goes off good, it goes off, awesome, 
and if it flops, everybody just loses alot of sleep.  (yeah, sometimes 
you lose alot of sleep a couple of nights in a row too, as the thing gets 
busted/postponed/etc.)  Still, though, i would rather drive around all 
night for free that pay $20-25 to go to a cool world event....but that's 
just personal preference... :) jessica

        A few caveats...

        - you need Sun, SGI or DEC Unix.

        - you need a high-bandwidth Internet connection

        - you have to negotiate MBONE connectivity with your network
provider.  MBONE is actually a virtual Multicast backBONE which runs over
a subset of the Internet.

        SCO will support the MBONE stuff at some point in the future...
this is not a product anouncement.

Well, a full moon allegedly on a friday nite. Accessible to so many people.
How will wicked ever live with that? Oh, the humanity!

I'm sorta divided. Really, some fmr have been high points in my tear-filled

loved ones, either. Besides bein' just plain sloppy about sites and info,
ugh! Doesn't help that (ok, so I gloat) Allen couldn't find "his" own
party, but hey, he did give bad directions himself (heh).

But magic does happen sometimes. I hope to be there, hope it goes off, hope
everyone is manically smiling (when you show your that punching bag in the
back of yer mouth) . And share fruit and hugs and yells and see who can
make Jeno laugh first (i swear, he did at ftt, maybe at my dress, maybe
just happy)and that we all make it here and back without any impairments,
Amen!

If any of us find out, would it be unorthodox to IMMEDIATLY post, including
possibly missleading rumors? Just wanted to know, thaaaat's aaaaall.


    Anyway, bring and tell every one you love, they should be there. 


Lotsa love,

 Since I have been the one responsible for most of the projected
 visuals and am working on those for the next party, I am glad to
 hear about people's preferences, especially when helpful suggestions
 are given. 

 At F&F III, I did straight/processed video, at the F&F IV we added the
 camera and some other effects and each time I try to bring more stuff.
 I'm working on some more whirling "spin cycle" type visual segments
 but those really eat up a large number of images very fast ie it takes
 a lot of time to collect all these diverse images. I must admit that
 I am not a fan of one or two images projected for 30 minutes and prefer
 short segments which have a theme or tell a story... but then I also
 want to branch out and please as many people as possible. Note that
 at both parties F&F III and IV we shut the projectors down and turned
 down the lights for longer than 30 minutes. Suggestions, tend to indicate
 that maybe we should do more of that also.

 I might bring my laser and find a way to create strange laser clouds,
 perhaps with Sean's laser and mine ( and doesn't Laura have one? ) we
 could create a nice effect... I know Sean's pulsating laser shows up
 nicely in the video I recorded last time...

 If anyone has some ideas to contribute - keep those "cards and letters"
 flowing... also favorite video clips, ideas etc. always appreciated.


 Perhaps, you could send me E-mail directly, if you don't want to tie
 up the list...

 Always open to good ideas...

It seems like this age theme keeps reoccuring on sfraves.  It's kind of sad
to see.  I'm sure the people who are older have a valid reason for disliking
younger-aged parties, but I have no idea what it is.  I'm 23 and I love
going to raves where I'm one of the oldest people there.  High school kids
have a lot more energy these days than they did when I was in high school
(sorry for the gross generalization).  They also don't deal with as many
limitaions as my age group did.  As far as that 14 year old goes, I remember
the first time I tried X and I was probably the same way.  I love to talk to
younger kids who you can tell are experiencing some of that stuff for the
first time.  If you just get over the age gap (this is easy to do just by
dropping the "I'm older than you, been there/done that" vibe) you'll hear
some of the most incredible things from the people you talk to.  I'll bet
that 14 year old would have been a blast to hang out with that night.  And
younger kids always seem to appreciate having an older guide for their first
experiences.  

I don't mean for this to be all about drugs, though.  Sometimes its nice to
rave completely clean (some people swear by this method) and a lot of times
the only people to talk to who aren't cruising through hyperspace are the
younger ones.  I love em all.  They look to me like a big brother figure,
and I look to them as being a little wiser than me for not yet having been
quite as broken-spirited by our social system.  Funny how that works, but
the vibe at younger raves is much more exciting for me and I always leave
with a little more hope and love than I came in with.

I don't know about anyone else, but these Battle of the Promoters strains
are becoming tiresome.  I don't mind hearing about politics, the Great
American smokeout, or what small children say about love...these things are
all a part of this community, and YES it is a community.  But whose party
did or didn't get busted 6 months ago seems like something for a private
discussion.  Personally,  I don't guess I care.  I'm free to hit my delete
key at any time, it only takes a second.  But since the moderator of this
group is going to crack down on non-rave related stuff I just want to say
I'd rather see these attacks between the different promoters go (which oddly
enough end with a friendly invitation to their next party) than the stuff
that actually affects us as humans.  Flame away...

I *DO* agree with this.

However, more than on any other place on the net, this list represents to 
me "Friends and Family", and so I feel that I want to share valuable 
information with you.

The relevance of my previous post is that the connection to the Internet 
is a part of the sf-raves experience -- note how many party reviews 
describe who setup the terminal at the site, new Mosaic software, etc.

Given the very reasonable concern on all the rave net groups about the UK 
Criminal Justice Bill, I thought that it would be comforting to know that 
it looks like the US is going in just the opposite direction ( with the 
possible exception of substance abuse law, but it is *very* hard to 
convince people that different substances are different. :-) ).

And, in fact, so far I've received three messages like this one:

  Hi, Ken!
      Thanks for posting this. Now I'm not *quite* as terrified as I was 
      before...

Since the media likes to slam whoever is in power, it is unlikely to 
report this particular information.

>Please respect the mail boxes of the 400 people who have allowed you to write
>to it.  Thanks, and sorry to have to sound like such a dweeb.

As Will once mentioned, we know that you have the best intentions at 
heart, I'm sure no one thinks you sound like a dweeb when you exercise 
your responsibility as administrator of this list.

And, I think in the future, perhaps posts such as my previous one should 
be marked by the author "For Your Information Only, further discussion 
here is inappropriate".

I'm just sitting here in my living room listening to my Pharcyde CD
and realizing that I have not purchased any new hip-hop for a long time.
This is becuase I am not really into that scene, but I LOVE funky, phat
hip-hop beats + crazy rhymes.  Could someone fill me in as to what is really
cool in the hip-hop world today?  Like I said, stuff on par with Pharcyde is
what I am looking for.  CD's *or* any good hip-hop mix tapes is what I seek.

On another note, I find this whole age thing kind of funny just becuase in LA
none of the best clubs ever had ANY age limit (including Dream, King, Flammable
Liquid and What?). A 21+ club in LA is unheard of.  At least, there were never
any 21+ clubs I wanted to go to.  This is probably becuase LA club promoters
greased the fire marshals and held events in soundstages and such.  (A mere 80
dollars an hour kept your party bust free, as long as it remained in 
compliance with fire regulations.)  This kept age division non-existent there.

Yes, I have a small HeNe and of course I'll bring it.  I would love
to help set up a series of mirrors -- it might be nice to do in
the small room.

Also, I have a pile of twinkle chrismas lights.  Some in color, and
some just white.  I would like to bring them to use in the small
room in some way.

yeah, it kind of grosses me out too but i was actually sort of interested 
and fascinated in a weird way...scene "politics" have always been a mystery 
to me.  All ages scene vs. older scene, underground vs. commercial, etc, 
etc... also i think its interesting to see how some of it is just pure 
childish rivalry and some of it is actual disagreement on issues that 
come up, like whether or not it's ok for a 14 yr old kid to take E and 
whatnot...           --jess

	The US cannot go in the opposite direction of the Criminal 
Justice Act, in many ways. Not only does the Criminal Justice Act attacks 
raves, it attacks an entire lifestyle. It goes after the 
crusties/travelers/(and this one is a quote)soap dodgers ;) to make them 
contributing members of society, to wwhallo in the fact that they cannot 
find a job instead of using it as an oppurnity to see what's out there. 
It makes squatting illegal. No it wasn't illegal til now, but here in the 
states, you can be arrested for tresspassing on public land after dark 
(hmm, to point to what I was trying to get at, it used to be the case, 
but no longer is, that you could sleep in the park w/o being hassled). 
Granted we do not have any horrible laws that prohibit gathering in a 
public park to listen to music with a repetative beat (no in our case, it 
is a blanket disturbing the peace that you can be slapped with - although 
it seems only the San Mateo cops will actually ticket you... ) 
	I can blabber about this for a long time, but as I have seen it, 
the Criminal Justice Act brings the UK closer to our country, not the it 
moves it away from us in the wrong direction.

what i wanna know is:  where does a 14-year-old kid get the $$ to buy
happy candy, anyway?  

when mom and dad find out what some of their kids have been up to, there
will be hell to pay.  they won't blame their offspring nearly as much as
they'll blame US, the supposedly responsible adults.  yikes!

in particular, i remember a very young girl sitting on the front porch at
a new moon party sobbing 'cause her friends wouldn't take her back to marin
and she was tired.  anyway, that was a difficult situation.

well, gotta jam!

People go to raves for a variety of reasons.  To some folks, raving
can be a serious mindbending experience, where the dance floor becomes
a place to enter a trance state, let go of one's identity, and become
one with the music.  The energy and unified vibe that is generated when
an entire party is focused in this way can be incredible.  People connect 
with each other on a more abstract plane of reality where language, how 
you look, or who your friends are become irrelevant.  If you want to
interact on a more human plane of existence, there are usually areas 
away from the dance area for that.

For others, a rave is an exciting place to go out; where you and your
friends squeal with delight at being able to just be together.  Sure, 
dancing is fun, but the main thing is being so happy to be out in such a
positive and free environment where you can express your exhuberance 
to each other, unfettered by the stoginess of the more emotionally 
restrained.  If people who you don't know aren't into your vibe, it just 
doesn't matter, because your friends are here and happy to see you.  The 
dance floor becomes a place to hug and talk and laugh and blow whistles...
Trance out?  What for?  All that really matter is that people express 
their positive energy to each other, right?

Of course, these categories aren't *necessarily* age specific.  But
different kinds of parties tend to have energy that can be focused 
(or unfocused) in different ways.  And sometimes, the flavor of the
vibe just isn't at the wavelength you are on.  At some parties, I often
find myself searching for a space where the vibe feels right for me.  Or
sometimes you just have to wait for it to emerge.  Sometimes, the age
restrictions can make a difference.  I've had great and not-so-great
experiences at all of em.

Topher has regained consciousness but is now bored . His jaw is wired 
shut and there are other complications but he could use visiters, he is 
rather depressed at waking up in the condition he is in. 

Once again that fabulous club kid/dj topher (chris fourmier) is at sf 
general on potrero and about  22nd st floor  4e    maybe now moved to 4A.

I'd have to say the new Massive Attack and Portishead albums, and maybe
the new Diggable Planets.  All three are more of the trip-hop school

(Percy Faith bumble bee in my big balloon)
Maybe its communication in everyway But conversation. 
Body language has an elevated importance.  I would say how
people look IS important.  Not in a 'look at those geeky
penny loafers' way but certainly I have been Seriously 
entertained/inspired/launched by how someone looks or
moves.  How they carry themselves.  They have 
connected with me thru that.

I'm thinking of times where I'm dancing and I turn and see
someone (or better) *everyone* just going at it like no tomorrow.
A snapshot.  A moment that is perfection.  How beautiful.
What about Minty or Sexy or Funny or Surreal moments?
Shared moments are the best.

It is like walking into a kitchen  
where you can really smell whats cooking.
This isn't 'seriously mind bending' to me.  
It is being alive.


CATEGORY II.
> For others, a rave is an exciting place to go out

It is a party after all - who wants to go to 
a boring party?


CONCLUSION ?
> Of course, these categories aren't *necessarily* age specific.  

I think when a party gets overwhelmed by younger folks then
there is less appreciation for all of it.  People with great
enthusiasm for one aspect of it.  Everyone doing the same
thing cuz (a) it's fun  (b) this is It, baby, the shit!
The energy and level of involvement is great but the
narrower scope and lack of variety is boring.

great american scotch-out)

Lee, the above description: "The energy and unified vibe that is generated when
an entire party is focused in this way can be incredible.  People connect
with each other on a more abstract plane of reality where language, how
you look, or who your friends are become irrelevant", is just so *right
on*.  That is how I feel at most good parties especially the F&F's.  That
is the reason why I get this urge over and over again to go out dancing for
that liberating feeling of absolute freedom through music.  Age is not an
issue in most cases.

Although I am part of the "older" crowd (Oh! my, another one is out), I
would disagree in saying that "older people dislike younger-aged parties".
First I think separating us as younger and older is the wrong frame of mind
to have as we are more of a community, a group of very diverse people going
out for one purpose as Lee describes above.  Personally, I like any party
that has a sense of *maturity* and I've been to many great all age parties.
I may be hesitant at times to go to an all age party because sometimes
they turn out to be strickly very young and sometimes vibeless.  A sense
that people do not know what they went out there for...aimlessly roaming
around...not dancing.  It's a difficult thing to pin point exactly why?
Maybe it's a feeling of not belonging (and that does not have anything to
do with age as I feel that way in some 21+ parties too).  Oh! and you want
to know the *real vibe killer* at parties; some complete stranger walking
to you asking if you have drugs to sell...Plllease do your shopping
elsewhere!  That is just one thing that erks me big time because it can be
dangerous and risky in *many respects* not to mention the feeling that one
can't have fun without it and that raves are only about drugs.

By the way has anyone tried a true "sober" trance experience.  Try it if
you *dare*, it could be the most satisfying trip you'll ever do.  I like to
dance both ways, they are just entirely different and both fulfilling in
their unique way.

Well...kind of got off the subject here, but just some thoughts from one
"any age" raver.

Denis,  ravnbird@crl.com

Just in case any of you musical gurus out there, bands,
performers, medialites and the like (WBL) might be interested:

The South by Southwest Music and Media conference 
will once again be held in Austin, TX, on 
March 15-19, 1995. If you want to register as a performer,
it costs $225 before December 16, more after that date.
Walk-up registration is $350. These fees are group fees-
you get to specify how many band members and crew members 
are in your group, or - at least it's not a per person 
fee. Could F&F have upwards of 300 crew members? hmmm....
I guess they'd get suspicious.  

If you only want to be a pedestrian viewer, I think 
a pass to ALL of the performances at ALL of the different 
venues ALL over Austin for the 4-day duration costs 
about $30-$40. I can probably get some old time acquaintences 
to pick up passes and mail them or hold them if someone's 
interested. Or, call info in Austin (512) 555 1212 and 
ask for the # of Star Tickets and/or Waterloo Records.
The passes won't go on sale for quite a while, but it might 
not hurt to ask when you should call back.

Well, I don't know of any law around here that bans outdoor public gatherings

This is something interesting I heard on the radio news the other evening 
while driving along the cliff.  

Apparently a priest whose son was murdered by some person has decided to 
forgive the murderer after he officially apologized to him.  Not only did 
he forgive him, but he went to the person's parole board hearing to vouch 
for him and he was jsut released from prison!  Then this priest just 
performed the wedding ceremony for this person who murdered his son.  The 
priest said he did not want, don't quote me on this, but something like 
he did not want to keep on hating for the rest of his life.  

So I thought some of you might be interested in reading this little bit 
of positivity.  Comments are welcome...

I believe that's related to the "Course in Miracles"... 
hatred does the hater more damage than the hated..
"practice forgiveness.."

Hmmm! Selling cats!  Now there's a racket!  I'll bet there's an entire
underground black market for cats...I can see it now, you're walking down a
dark alley when a tall man shrouded in shadow whispers, "Hey man, I got
something that'll make you feel all warm and cuddly."  But what he's not
telling you is that the next day you'll be all sneezy with watery eyes, but
you can't stop cuddling that damn cat...then you're hooked.  It's the way
cat dealers work, man...Cats...just say no.  Dogs are more fun, less
addictive, and have no major side effects except for slobbery hands, if you
keep throwing the damn tennis ball.

I don't think x will ever be "first one free."  If I'm wrong, please,
someone educate me otherwise.  It was a good joke anyway, Robert! :)

I'm 42 and I don't know what it is either.
I prefer outdoor parties to clubs any day (except, perhaps a very cold and

I know this is TOTALLY out of line, but I'm a newcomer to the area...cut 
some slack.
How can I find out about the Full Moon schindig?  Is there a fone # I 
missed somewhere? Are they in SF or should I plan on driving to Sonoma or 
what.  I live pretty far away from SF and if it's out this way I could 
save some gas by knowing that a little in advance.
Anyone care to fill me in or is the topic completely taboo? Personal mail 
is appropriate.
thanks

That would really kill the Phillip Glass outdoor tour. I can see him and

Mmmm, Wicked good.  Personally, I enjoyed watching Thomas perfect the sport
of cross-country ski dancing.... its a little like some the the synchro swim
dancers we have :-)
I went to the AES(Audio Engineering Society) convention on Sunday and had to
go by the Turbosound booth and thank them for building such killer purple
sound systems - actually the ones at the convention were definately more blue
than Wicked's.   They(well the one rep I spoke with) hadn't actually heard of
Wicked, but were impressed by the size of the system for "a mobile DJ
outfit"(understatement of the year I know!!)
Thumbs up for Markie spinning jungle breaks - I wasn't dancin so great to it
due to my poor choice of mood enhancers(a few too many beers and bong hits at
an party earlier)  but I think someone who's sensitive to our SF needs like
Markie could work us towards having more jungle mixed in.

"Waiting for you!" conducted and performed by Jeno and the
Technics/Turbosound orchestra....

Well, maybe not free but i've definitely heard of first one for $8 
(because you're such a good friend and if you do wanna try it, its really 
fun, so i could give you a deal...)   

that was in the bay area.  then in new york i came accross a situation 
where people who were actually working for the organizer of the party 
were selling E for $25, (an ok price in NYC) and turned out to be cut 
with smack, and my friend (yes, my friend, not me--i haven't bought e 
since i left sf) took it and complained that she felt "too fucked up" 
(this wasn't her first time on e, btw)
at first but then later in the "trip" (i usually reserve that term for more 
sophisticated experiences like lsd etc) she said she loved it and wanted 
to take it again soon.
  The following week it was $30.
  $25 was the "introductory price."
                       (but that would never happen in our scene, right?)

sometimes i'm not sure about E.  sometimes when i'm high i notice a tiny 
part of my skeptical consciousness trying to get my attention, saying, 
"hey, wait--this feels too euphoric--and i could use that $15..."

(Other times tho i fuckin love it!)

It's the first rave being put on by my pal Rich who I alluded to as 
needing flyer art some weeks back...  It will be at a familiar but well 
loved SF location.  Dunno if its 18+ or 21+.  Should be a pro job, Rich 
has more connections than a switchboard as David Emery would say.  
Everyone come out and support what should be a darn good party.

I first ran into Rich at Gilman punk gigs...  Then at Crash Worship 
shows, hey there's that same guy again...  I went to raves and hey, can 
that be the same guy?!?!  So I had to get to know this man of such 
discerning taste that I would always see him at the same events I was at.
Say hi to him, he's a cool guy, he's a short Latino guy with BIG hair.

As for Travis, I dunno, I just love suprises, don't you?

See y'all at FM...

I'm keeping this short intentionally.

I can assure you that I've given each of you involved every credit for
your obvious ignorance in delivering the various frat boy and frat
party platitudes.

I lived through it, got things out of it which I doubt I would have
gotten anywhere else, and learned a hell of a lot about life the
universe and everything.

And, strangely enough, I'm not a beer swigging rapist.  (At least not
during the week, it interferes with my productivity.)

This is a cyclic thread which seems to come up every six to eight
months here, and I'm sorry, but I'm going to respond to it every time.
Especially now that I'm back here in Boston and missing you guys and
the community I was part of / you still have.

Lots of love,
Bob

I tried cool world buzztown (and for the first time) even after reading a 
post by , I can't remember who saying..."Cool World is like a high school 
dance but without the basket ball hoops"
I can not generalize Cool World after only attending one party, but my 
experience on Saturday do point in the direction of a high school dance.
The people there were not very diverse in age.  It seemed like alot of 
first tme ravers, not knowing what to do how to feel.  Too scared to have fun
or too tough to socialize.  There was not the love or friendliness you find at 
ComUnity, XYZ, Futur, Funky Techno.....  No one was handing out blow pops 
with a smile, sharing their water, coming up and introducing themselves and 
getting to know you.  When I tried no one was receptive except for one small
group.

I also noticed that no one was dancing (going off) like at the other raves.  The music
at buzztown was a little difficult to dance to in the beginning.  BUT at 2:00am
whoever came on was fantastic.  It even got me off the cold bare cement floor to 
go out with the unfriendly natives (no one else in our group would though) and dance
for the first time that night.  Everyone was subdued in their dancing and backed up 
if anyone came close, so I stopped dancing and went back to my COLD COLD cement
floor and sat down.  By 2:30 everyone in our group wanted to go.  Maybe we left too 
soon and the festivities started after.  I can't say.


There's more....

Also I have been reading about the less than humaniod secutiry at the Wicked.  
I think there clones were at Buzztown.  There was a young man who was obviously
peaking outside in line.  He started walking past the 6 people in line waiting to 
be frisked and probed, and went to the front and said "I must go inside"  the 
large burly security woman grabbed him and shoved him back.  I was the next person
in line and told her I did not mind if he went in ahead of me.  He was frying and 
needed to get in more than I did.  She called for another security clone and told them
he was not to be admitted.  The young man apoligized and said "I just need to be 
inside"  I added the comment "wait a minute he is frying, isn't it better to have him 
inside (controlled) then to send him off to dirive home or out on the strets frying ?"
She asked me if I would like to keep him company OUTSIDE !!! growl.

To close it up 

Buzztown was not a great time for me or the group I was with.  After reading all of the 
e-mails about Wicked we are really sorry we did not go to it.  It sounds like it had 
the warm fuzzy family feeling we looked for at Buzztown.  

(big breath in..)  Now are you sorry you asked ?



one more thing  I have never been to a Wicked... sounds like I am missing out 
see you all there at the next one for sure...
 

Also

See, you didn't go to the old Cool World's, and the warehouse 
parties.  The reason for using a spot such as the Cow Palace, 
is to accomodate all the people.  Try to find a warehouse that 
can hold 10,000 people, and is fully permitted and safe...

That was me, but about Wicked.  I said it looked like a high

Actually, it was you, yes, but you were talking about Basics.  (Basics, 
not Wicked, was the one that was held in a gym.)  Again, if you want me to 
forward you the message, i will.

definitely..especially since promoters use terms such as "Love, Peace,
togetherness"  in same breath as they would bash each other.  Its as bad as
tv evangelism!

On the subject of Sunset, I shot about 15 rolls of film this summer at
Sunset. I've been thinking of presenting a series of the pictures and seeing
if I could get them shown somewhere. Alas I am a very busy young lad, and
have not had much time to think about them. Would anybody be interested in
seeing them, and or helping me get them shown. Many of them I need to get
reprinted and blown up since I gave most of them away to the subject of the
photo at the following Sunset. Does anyone work in a print shop? Discount?

I thought the Tribal Funk flyer was boasting the Shredder sound system?

Have plans changed, or it related to Pacific's sound system?

Dear Bob--I guess you missed my follow up where I apologized profusely 
for making such sweeping generalizations.  I apologize to you personally 
then. 
I am prone to erring from my own set of ethics--aren't we all?  My 
problem with frats is, ironically, that they often generalize and make 
insults about the type of person I am.  I'm learning to "rise above the 
problem" but every once in a while I lose my head and say something dumb 
that only adds to the factionalism.  
Again, I apologize to you, and to anyone else who might have been 
affected by my generalizations about frats and frat-followers. peace
jase.

I doubt it was cut with heroin given that heroin goes for over $150/gram.

At a rave I attended this past summer in Houston, E laced with heroin was 
being sold--you could tell because of the small brown spots in the pill 
if you split it open.  At any rate, it was extremely weak (for me, others 
really got off on it) and I had to have an incredible time without it ;)

  Well, at least the building it was in was! :) ...  I showed up at 
Kinetic around 2am.  Having had a shitty past week and having just DJ'd a 
shitty college party, and also having not been to a GOOD party in a 
month...I was anxious :> 

  When I walked into the ENORMOUS warehouse (they must of used it to 
build boats or something..) there was a small crowd of about 100 people 
and Lee was on the decks..  I was so glad to hear him spin after missing 
F&F, and I was treated to an incredible acid bath!  I missed Galen but
US Thomas, Das and Corbin all did fantastic sets!.

  The crowd picked up a bit around 3:30, probably a bunch of people who 
gave up on FMR.  

  Many props to the Kinetic crew for having an awesome sight, great music 
and a very friendly atmosphere.  I highly recommend going to one of their 
parties (which I think are weekly now) if you haven't allready.

  Peace out, and hope to see some of you at Kundalini!

Yeah, go ahead and forward it.  This guy is trying to tell me 
that Cool World breaks up other parties, and that I said that.  
I have all of my old mail right here, and I never implied that 
in any of my mail.

	A little bit of smack can go a long way and when you eat an e and 
an hour latter are sitting there with your vision all fucked up and 
realize that you are doing nothing more than 'smacking' your lips, and 
further more you do not seem to care that you are sitting there smacking

	Little brown specks could be a lot of things, and I have seen 
plenty of smacky e-s that are nice and white (or so they looked under the 
given lighting conditions of the Vaults - hich means it looked the same 
color that the light did). Also, I knew some people who had packed brown 
sugar in the gel caps to make it taste better. Hmmm, I also remember 
seeing a batch that had been over cooked at some point in the production 
and had turned kinda brownish (this was the actual MDMA now). So color I 
would have to say is not a way to judge.

Sounds more like MDEA, a drug similar to MDMA but more "stoning" i.e. it 
makes you somewhat drowsy and feeling that you just got a lobotomy.  I 
think there was more of it last year, but it's still around somewhat.  The 
phrase "cut with heroin" is to me kind of a code of for MDEA.  I've never 
done heroin, but nystagmus (eye wiggle) and lip smacking sound more 
typical of a phenethylamine than of an opiate.  Check out MDE in the 
hyperreal archives for more info.

David

P.S. all of the above is based on serious scientific research ;-)

If you were it's kinda understandable (if we're not talking about days 
here).  Mailing list reflection isn't instantaneous, for some people it 
takes a minute, for others an hour, and if the machine hyperreal was 
trying to deliver to was down or refusing connections, it'll retry it a 
little while later.  The OCF's mail daemon is particularly bad about 
going for several hours without picking up the connection, so when it 
does wake up and hyperreal can get through then some later messages may 
arrive before older ones get delivered.  

One solution is to sort your mailbox by date, which should pick up on the 
Date: header, rather than in order of receipt.

	Brian

Little brown spots inside pills are not evidence of heroin.

Fiber pills in my one-a-day supplement pack have little tiny brown spots
inside, but I've never felt euphoric by ingesting them.  Well, maybe a little
cleaner...

Heroin, to be ingested, has to be injected or smoked.

OK, last night I went and did exactly that.  I made up a 3-minute tape of
continuous music, with no blank spots, so as to defeat any attempts at blank-
space-sensing and automatic start ID insertion by the decks.  I then ran
experiments using two SV3700s and a Sony DTC-700.  Here are the results:

Sony DTC-700 -> SV3700 via coaxial S/PDIF interface:  If the "auto start ID"
LED on the SV3700 is on, the SV3700 records all of the start IDs sent by the
DTC-700, as and when they are sent.  If the "auto start ID" LED is off, the
SV3700 records a single start ID when the tape is first put in motion and
ignores any start IDs sent from the DTC-700.

SV3700 -> Sony DTC-700 via coaxial S/PDIF interface:  The SV3700 transmits all
the start IDs recorded on the tape and the DTC-700 duly records them on the dub.

SV3700 -> SV3700 via coaxial S/PDIF interface:  The source SV3700 transmits all
the start IDs recorded on the tape.  If the "auto start ID" LED on the
destination SV3700 is on, the destination deck records all of the start IDs sent
by the source, as and when they are sent.  If the LED is off, the destination
SV3700 records a single start ID when the tape is first put in motion and
ignores any start IDs sent from the source.  In other words, no difference
when the source deck is another SV3700 instead of the DTC-700.

This conclusively proves that SV3700s both send and receive start IDs over
the S/PDIF interface.

Does it matter whether or not the DTC-700 is in auto-StartId mode?

Hey all,
    First, for legality sake, let's say I'm a professional artists with
consumer equipment.  I want to strip SCMS (set to 00) from a signal. 
What is the easiest/cheapest way to do this.  I'd rather not deal with
assembling a DSD kit and the DPP from Core Sounds has too many features
that would be useless to me (i.e. multiple outputs, battery power). 
Does there exists a box with one optical input and one optical output
that sets SCMS to 00?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

- Bill

Regarding the D7's sleep mode, mine too does not power down when connected to
AC--only when powered by batteries.  I also doubt that differences in voltage
by either power source really determines implementation of the unit's sleep
mode.  Rather, it seems the unit is capable of detecting its power sources and
acts accordingly.  I think sleep mode was intended for the sole purpose of
preserving battery life--an unneeded feature when pulling an inexhaustible
supply of current through AC.

I rigged up a power supply for my HD-X1 as follows:  Cut a block of pine
in the exact shape of the battery. Drilled holes lengthwise through the
block, ran heavy gauge wire through the holes, and fashioned contact plates
in the same spots as the battery terminals.

Then I cut a rectangular notch in the bottom of the battery door, just
big enough for both wires to pass through. The battery fits in snugly,
and the door closes. The result is an HD-X1 with two mechanically
secure heavy gauge wires sticking out the side.

For power, I use Powersonic 6V 10Ah batteries. These will run the deck
for about 10 hours at a time. The only drawback to this arrangement
is the size and weight of the batteries -- they are about 6" by 4" by 2"
and way about 4 pounds each -- something to consider if you plan on
carrying 2 batteries to shows like I do.

These are lead-acid batteries and like to be kept at full charge
My standard home setup is two batteries, side by side, connected to a
charger, with my 2 dat decks (Aiwa HDX1 and Sony D7) connected to them.
The sony is connected using a power cord ordered from Sony parts.
When playing DATs at home, I just run them off the battery, and let the
charger put back what I take off.

Thanks to Brandon and Jim White for conducting the test on SV-3700 and
Auto-ID mode through the S/PDIF inputs with recorded silence.

The times I have tried Auto-ID in digital copy mode, it has also inserted ID's
anytime the signal dropped below -xx dB for more than about 3 seconds, whether
there was a Start ID on the source tape or not. So I usually end up with a
lot of extra Start-ID's with live classical music. This was probably using
AES/EBU for the copying, however (I know it doesn't TRANSFER Start ID's
when copying over AES\EBU ports). Another interesting test would be to
have music with silent spaces, and include Start ID's in some of the silent
spaces but not others, and see if it does that right in S/PDIF mode.

I have been following this list since about Digest #880 (before they rolled it
over to 1 again).  I am interested in DAT for the primary purpose of archiving
my large record and tape collection, and creating "frequently used" copies.  I
am trying to decide between DAT and MD, but am wary of the still-unsettled
market.  I am currently leaning toward DAT as it has an established market
(meaning a stable tape supply).

In order to make this move feasible, I want both a home deck and one to replace
the cassette deck in my car.  It is hard enough to find a home DAT in the
consumer range (circa $600), let alone trying to find one for the car.  I have
heard periodic stories about Sony making a DAT with its UniLink CD changer
controls.  This is the ideal solution, but do these units exist?

I think I am confused.  I thought the purpose of the skip id was
to allow you to skip over parts of your original tape.  Did this
happen when you made the transfer?  If so, then what is the value
of transferring the skip id to the new tape?  If not, then is there
any way to use skip ids to get an edited digital transfer to a new
tape?

It would be nice if other people could try this experiment with
other combinations of DAT decks.  In particular, I would like to
know what would happen to the start/skip ids if the source machine
is a 3700 and the destination machine is a DA-P20.

Thanks for all the great feedback so far on the rewinder project.

It seems that a lot of folks would only pay around $50 for such a
box. At that price it just won't get off the ground. I'm no tech-head
but I don't think you can just stick a motor in a box.  

It seems to me it has to be a fairly sophisticated mechanisim to allow 
for the proper loading and tensioning of the tape. That's why we think 
the DDS drives we have access to would be perfect. The only problem is 
that the guy wants $100 each for them. A lot of money but not a lot when 
you consider the cost of a new DDS drive. We also need to put the drive 
in a box with a power supply and figure that will cost another $40.

So I would think the box would have to sell for around $200 unless
we can get the guy to lower his price on the DDS drives.

Any comments and suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks again

The key word here is "could".  They were supposed to have a big

World has successful parties.  And about the flyers.  I guess 
you weren't around in the old days when all of the flyers were

Unfortunately these are not 'platitudes'.  Please do a literature
search and you will find a body of scientific research that shows
'frats' are statistically more misogenist, racist, homophobic than the
average student.

Even tho' this is true, we still should treat each other as individuals.

Heroin is not very active at all orally. If a pill was laced with
something, if it were heroin it wouldn't be enough to have an effect
at all. One would have to take several pills sonsisting solely of
heroin to have a perceivable effect.

Yeah, that's something that not many people seem to realize, that
internet SMTP mail is not guaranteed to be delivered immediately, or
even in any particular order. It usually works out that way, but it
isn't guaranteed.

It would have been nice for Wicked to least let people know over the 
voice-mail that it wasn't going to happen instead of people questioning 
and doubting.  I called the voicemail 4:30am on Saturday, and it still 
had the same message from hours before.

The E-Ticket to Phun and games
------------------------------

Well,   time once again for a report from the SF Rave scene.     For me,   it
was the usual non-sleep weekend.    On Thursday,   I get this call from Jose
who invites me to an event they call the E-Ticket for $15.   For that,  each
of those attending get something more than just admittance.    I'll let you
figure out what the door prise is.     Hint:   The name says it all...   :-)

It was important that we all arrive BEFORE 1:30 am for this special private
party,   held at the Stevenson address (Remember:  YSH last year,  also
Cordoroy City?).

When we arrive,   it was totally packed,   with the vibe expecially good.
People hooting and hollering as the DJ was spinning some really great trancey
stuff.    WOW!!  Dispite the almost tiny venue,   this party was exceptional
but I was denied the door prize.    For a while,   runors abound that Jose
had skipped out with ALL our money,    But I gave him a reasonable time to
show up.    He eventually did,   but with NO door prize,  but was eager to
give the money back to those that didn't get the door prize.   The dancing
area was so packed that that the only way to move was UP and DOWN.

At about 4 am,  when Carlos was just getting ready to go on,    the PIGS 
arrived and shut it down.   Oh well,   at least I got my money back,   which
means that I would make Kundalini on Saturday.    I chilled in the haight
for the 1 1/2 hours until the Endup opened up at 6 am,  then danced there
like there was no tommorrow until my friend picked me up.

We got rumours that a Scottish Festival was to take place in Golden Gate park,
so we head out there to check it out,   but later we learned it was cancelled.

We all head back to Mill Valley to prepare for Kundalini.    I did my usual
meditation/yoga/thai chi schtick... to work out a few "Energy blockages"
for preparation for yet another nights worth of dancing.

Rumours indicated that Kundalini was to be at the Trocadero...    GREAT!!
one of my favorite venues (but security normally SUX dog do doo)... but
they used Lyon's security this time.   There was the usual weapons and
drug search each were subjected to.

We also learned that one of our friends forgot his ID,  so two if my 
friends had to try and find somewhere else for entertainment.    Which I 
later learned they all had phun hanging out at a Ambient DJ's pad spinning 
all night,  turning their brains into mush by whatever substances that 
were available that evening.

Kundalini was promoted by a "New kid on the block",  and they did it up just
GREAT!!  The VIBE was exceptional with a very high SFRave quotent.   The Troc
was really done up right with superb visuals,  lazers,  video, projection
equipment,  and the works.    The decore was exceptional.   WOW!!  I didn't
even know the Troc could look that good.    The Troc also did a very good 
job in temperature management,  as things were very cool and comfortable.

There was NO ins-and-outs until 4 am,   but I didn't care,  it was freezing
outside,  and I was dressed to dance all night in my shorts so didn't care
how wet I got.

Being my 2nd overnight dancing binge,  I had an incredable amount of energy
that evening and literally fell into a deep trance while dancing.   But all
too soon,  I discovered that the planet Earth's gravity was far too weak to
hold me on the dance floor between the beats because I was bounding so high
with such great energy.

It was nothing but smiles and joy,  all evening long,  as I completed my mission
to spread my energy and joy throughout the Troc.   Almost everyone I came in
eye contact with,  stepped up their dancing energy and grinned like there
was no tommorrow.   With the visuals and the sound system (Which was also
very exceptional) made for a superb evening.    I danced literally all evening
with very little chill time (only to cool off and ocassionally stretch out).

Even at the very end (At an early 6 am) it was very well packed.    In fact,
I would say that very few people left the rave before it ended.    The promoter
tried to pursuade the Troc to allow them to extend it until after 6 am,   but
thrir contract prohibited such flexability.   Sheesh!!  I yearn for a rave that
goes on till noon the next day,   but in this part of the world,  it usually
doesn't happen.

6 am came all too soon,   and we had to leave,   so we did the traditional
Bagdad Cafe visit,   then headed back to Mill Valley and some well deserved
sleep.   Yes!! Contrary to popular belief,  I DO sleep,   but not that often.

So,  I chalked this up for a very super cool energetic sleepless weekend,
and now I'm home,  hastily preparing this report before I leave with a few
friends for the Rainbow Gathering at Bug Sur.     I'll be gone until
ThanksGiving day,  and as soon as I finish this report (Sunday evening)
I head out to Big Sur.   Yippy!!

See you all next weekend....  and RAVE ON, and ON,  and On...

I have a friend who told me that the widespread belief that small 
brownish dots on E denote heroin is False.  He told me that these dots 
were just food coloring for decoration.  If the E had been cut with 
heroin, it would be evenly mixed instead of just in little spots.  Does 
anyone know if this is tru???  Just wonderin......

as far as statistics are concerned, at MIT the average fraternity
dweller does better, with a higher GPA and a better chance of
graduating, than someone living in the dormitory system.
significantly lower odds of suicide as well.

this isn't just a research paper or a literature search.  at the risk
of sounding melodramatic, i wouldn't have made it through school
without the help of my fraternity.

this is my last post on this subject.  followups to private email.
obviously a subject i'm a bit sensitive about.

(and Brian, could you redirect my subscription to this address?  i no
longer have an account at media.mit.edu.)

I've had e with brown spots that i know didn't have smack in it.

this whole thread sounds like another instance of myth against myth with

Well, later i heard it was MDA and heroin.  I don't know too much about 
heroin, but my friend did seem a little more narcotically euphoric than i 
would expect from normal e.  MDA also has that increased "stoning" 
effect--e.g. people who usually like to dance end up sitting in one place 
the whole night.  
  In any case, the e that started this whole thread was definitely 
sketchy--an hour after my friend took it she was leaning against the sink 
in the bathroom moaning, "oh my god you guys i am _really_ fucked up," and 
she isn't exactly a novice or a wimp when it comes to drugs...she chilled 
out for an hour or two and then felt better, danced with us for the rest 
of the night, and afterward said she might get some more...(I think 
that's the point of putting a little smack in there, if that's what it 
was...)

Janie & I had fun.

Music [B+]- We were there for Jeno's and Tony's set, and they both did 
their usual thing, i.e. Jeno was great with an excellent mix of acid, 
house and whatever, and Tony delivered a typically relentlessly hard
driving set of techno-acid-house, or whatever you want to call it.  I
heard some nice ambient played in upstairs chill area, unnecessarily loud, 
as usual.  

Vibe [B+] - People were into this party, hollering, smiling, dancing on
stage, etc.  There seemed to be a fairly high e quotient.  Except for
one or 2 dancing cigarette  wavers and one clutching couple, everyone
was considerate, friendly, and into the music.  I think this was an 18+ 
party, and it was good.

Visuals [A] - Great lazer, huge mirror ball, standard psychedelic screen
projection, and a bunch of other lighting effects.  Nice variety, well
executed. 

Sound [C+] - It was pretty good, once you found the sweet spots.  But
Tony's set sounded muddled to us; the stuff he spins is just so thick that 
you need a really crisp sounding system to deliver it properly.  

Comfort [A-] - The free water was all gone by the time we had arrived, but
available cups and a working sink sufficed.  The temperature/ventilation 
was great.  And thankfully, the upstairs didn't stink of fried food, like
at the last Megatripolis party.  

Security [F+] - When the door guy asked me if I had any weapons, I told
him that I wasn't sure if I had remembered to remove the AK-47 from my 
rectum before going out.  When I was informed that they weren't doing full 
cavity searches I became very concerned for my safety: who knows what 
kind of heinous crimes might be committed due to such laxness?  But my 
saner half assured me that she would protect me from all evil, so we went
in anyway. 

Actually, the securty guys would have annoyed me more if it weren't for 
their utter baffoonery; marching around in heavy leather and chains.  
ooooh.  One time when chilling, a goon lumbered amongst us and announced 
loudly to no one in particular that anyone caught smoking pot would be 
arrested.  Everyone reacted as though someone had just cut a really loud 
fart and politely ignored him.

Extras: Saw some familiar faces - Roxanne, Milton, Crunch, Ronan, 
David (forgot yer last name; not Alves or Alga).  It was also good to see
some of the Pacific crew.  They have a party coming up Dec. 3rd, and plan
on doing one New Year's Eve.

All he's saying you said is what he quoted above.  You don't seem to be 
very careful reader, because you've misuderstood him and me both.  
Anyway, i don't really want to be involved in your little political 
battle, and i'm sure the rest of the list doesn't either, so maybe you 
guys should take it outside.    --jessica

higher average gpa yes...better rape/misogyny/homophobia record, *very* 
questionable.  i lived in a fraternity for a year while i was in college, 
(btw, i'm female, as my name indicates) 
and even though it had the campus wide reputation for being "the cool 
frat" in the sort of "alternative" scene i was hanging out in, i still 
got a really weird misogynist vibe around their house...it really sucked 
because those guys were some of my best friends, and i didn't know 
whether to blame the individuals or the "institution."
  (also i think i remember seeing whit (author of one of the original 
posts in this thread) at at least one of their parties... :-)
  anyway, it's a sensitive issue, and i probably shouldn't've gotten 
involved--mostly just wanted to make peace by saying i can definitely see 
where those generalizations come from, but also have tons and tons of 
love and respect for alot of individual "frat boys."
             peace...

Hi guys.. 

I got this question from a friend that took E for the first time a week back, 
and no the friend is not me :)
Does a standard job drug test scan for 'E' ?
How long does it stay in ur system?
I believe that we pee out approx. 70% of the stuff in a few hours.. but how long does
the rest stay in us? Of course I realize the question assumes that it was not laced
and that it was truly MDMA :)

Most drug tests look for marijuana, cocaine, opiate metabolites, and
amphetamines.  Pot will generally give a positive up to a month after,
cocaine and amphetamines about a week, and I'm not sure how long
opiates will give a positive.  While it is possible to test for
MDMA and psylocybin metabolites, among other things, that would not
be done in a routine screen and it would cost more for the company.

And compaining about drug tests here would be preaching to the church

good luck!

MDMA can show as an amphetamine on some tests...

Mijos, we all agree: the troc has incredible lights
it doesn't overheat.
it has a stage (I like seeing people smile up there)
it has a chill space
you can park/comute 

Kundalini's crew was cool enuf to hire two Lyon's security, you know, the
two cool guys in nylon jackets, that would say "no, that's cool, you don't
have to open yer bubble-bottle" I even got in with a can of powdered
gatoraid...

But the stall door in the loo is unclosable (so the house goons can open it
and bathe in the glow of your bodily functions) and they KICKED Rich and
Vadeem  and crew out at 6 am (I don't give a fuck, it's over! Move yer
people out!), besides letting one of those tour buses pull up (see sf
nite-life up close!). Sucks to not have controll over who can come to your
party...Jeez, one of the  guy's called "spider", probably 'cause he's got
cobwebs on his(tut!tut!milton, are you getting angry, here?)

Maybe if someone could compile the good/bad posts about the space and maybe
let the owner see them, he could get new security, at least on our nights.

Okay, okay, okay...

	I don't know if the studies show that frat kids are A students or 
not, all I know is that everytime *I* have gone to frat party I have 
heard all kinds of things that make my stomach twist in a most 
uncomfortable way.  It seems like no matter where I turn I hear 
"faggot-this" or "cocksucker-that" or any other array of pijorative, 
insulting, demeaning comments about gay people. It's not entirely true of 
ALL frat-goers, but by and large frat houses are where I have experienced 
the harshest homophobic/heterosexist situations in my life. (The second 
worst is in a christian church!?!? Go figure...) 
So, my point is not to go back on my apologies about the frat thing;  by 
making insults about frats I have in no way resolved the problem I have 
with them. I slipped up. But, for as much as everyone has been upset 
by my loose generalizing, I feel that I have suffered the effects of 
frat-homophobia far more. My experiences with frats have been bad, yet I 
wrongly broadened my experiences to include all frat-types under all 
situations. My comment was made in vengeance, and I regret it; and I 
apologize, again.

Concerned citizens-

Just happened to be browsing through the High Times last night and saw 
something about brown spotty ecstacy in the national price guide they 
publish.  (the list is compiled by readers' quotes).
One person from the other side of the country wrote in about some ecstacy
 they picked up with brown spots in it (sound about right??)
The editor's note was that the spots usually occur when the batch is
"overcooked".  (from the June 1994 issue featuring "exotic pot spots"). I 
don't know if that means it's totally safe, but there wasn't a warning 
about it. Heat can cause HUGE changes in chemistry (pot for example: it goes 
from a completely inactive chemical, to a psychoactive one just by 
atmospheric heat, as in drying.) But again, no definitive word on it from 
the editor.

well, since i was there and hanging out with her most of the night i 
don't think the experience itself was an urban legend, but hey, maybe the 
heroin laced e think _is_ ... seems really weird--even the guys who sold 
it to her later said it had smack in it, but maybe they considered that a 
good thing and were making it up as a selling strategy.  Seriously tho-- 
there are alot of myths around, but there is also occasional bad e 
around.  
  anyway, you sortof hurt my feelings when you called my story an urban 
ledgend, but i think you're right about drug horror stories.  (This one isn't
even that big of a horror story--so she felt a little weird for a while, 
big deal)... i'm definitely not about to go around warning little kids 
about evil drug dealers trying to hook them on feel good 
pills...   :-)  --jessica

Didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I should know better than to post
pre-coffee - my nasty-o-meter doesn't work well without it.

I just do see a big need for debunking drug related myths, and
just about anything sold as laced-with-heroin is going to be
phoney, unless it costs quite a bit more than the avarage street
price as well.

Also, points about ingesting vs. more direct contact with the
bloodstream, etc.

It could be laced with other stuff, however, which is potentially
a lot worse...

Actually, I remember the situation being someone from Texas giving prices
for "Pure E" with brown flecks in it.  The editor said if it's got brown
flecks in it it's not pure because pure E is white.  Since I'm here in Texas
I occasionally see the E that floats around.  Back in May, before the
article was published, the stuff I ran across seemed pretty damn pure to me,
but lately...well, lets just say something "smacks" of impurity...

Heroin isn't the only substance that's brown. Safrole, for instance, an
MDMA precursor, is brown.

How active is heroin orally anyway?

I know of no 'Ecstacy' analyses that have turned up evidence of heroin.
(See E for Ecstacy by Sauners or the MDMA FAQ for more info)

Evidently they do these every 6 weeks or so. No phone number, no flyers,
tickets in advance. It was held in a loft type space that got packed
quickly. I was to spin in the ambient room, which turned out to be the old
school breakbeat/house room with little organization and virtually
non-existant sound leading me to bring my stereo from home which was
promptly blown. =(

Everybody was happy, though...=)

Evidently a girl was found passed out a couple of blocks away and they
found out about the party from her and busted it because of her
intoxication. I asked the cops if they'd received a complaint and they
responded "What, you think we look for this stuff? We have better things to
do." I wish.

I'll check the snippet again and re-post if I screwed up reporting.

Hmmm. . .  Heroin and codeine have _similar_ effects; and codeine is
dirt cheap.  Could it be that this is what was thrown in there?  Or
maybe one of those fentanyl derivatives that act like heroin and kill
a bunch of people every once in a while because of their potency?  I
don't doubt that all sorts of baloney end up marketed as E!

99% pure MDMA can be utterly, completely, totally brown. And anything can
be bleached. Color is unfortunately not a good indicator of purity.
Basically there's no easy way to tell, other than to obtain from a
trustworthy source.

Has anyone ever actually bought E from the chemist who makes it? I've 
never even bought from the guy who buys it from the guy who makes it. How 
trustworthy of a source can you have in the illicit drug world? I mean, 
other than knowing someone who's taken the "same stuff"--even that's a 
little dubious.
food for thought.

Since the party was held in the East Bay.. is it possible that the cops over there
are telling the truth? i.e., that only the ones in SF are bust-happy?

It takes A LOT to get a buzz from eating it tho'! Often heroin is 
packaged in tiny balloons so that the balloon can be swallowed 
and then passed if the cops grab you. Some people die this way...the 
balloon(s) burst and they OD. I don't know how much it takes to OD on 
ingested heroin. Apparently it is exceptionally rare to OD from 
snorting heroin.

Dude, the troc must be rakin' in some bux... Megatripolis followed by 
Wicked followed by Kundalini.  I'm not surprised the security is always 
in such poor humour, what having to feel all those people up over and over.

Three different times, and the place looked very different every single
time.  It is such a modular venue!  Maybe except for upstairs, which is
always the same.  Big green laser doing nutso things, very cool. 
Ventilation was primo and maybe almost chilly. brrr. keep shaking that
booty!

Hey man it's 18+ and lots of folks took advantage of this fact and there 
was alot of energy on the floor to show for it.  People were hooting and 
hollering in all the fun... some guys were dancing like I've never seen.  
The technoey music was great and very well delivered I thought through 
those darn massive wall-o-speakers that I've seen before.  They're all 
tied together and if you put your hand on a gap between them you'd swear 
the thing was gonna burst on every bass beat.  

Was that Galen who threw on "Hard Diversion" at the speed of sound?  And 
the crowd goes wild... 

You know, despite the very friendly people, the great music, the 
excellent visuals, water, ventilation, etc. I didn't feel that warm vibe 
feeling I love so much.  Did I miss the boat here?  But hey everyone was so 
nice I didn't care.

Did anyone else notice Dj Deaks in full swing at center stage? 

Right on.

O.o

    Just to add to some of the words others have said, this party was 
great!  My only complaint is that it should have been $10 all night and 
maybe even $5 before 11.  Although I suppose this price kept the Troc 
happy and from overflowing.

    As everyone has said, the lighting and lasers were great!  While I 
don't always like the club vibe, it's hard to find that kind of lighting 
at most smaller/underground parties.  

    I thought the sound was very well done too, it could have had a 
little bit more bass (except when right next to the speaker, my body 
didn't shake much..) but I thought it was nice and clear.

    It took a little while for the vibe to pick up, but around 3:30-4am, 
when most of the 'clubby fashion types' left it REALLY picked up.  It was 
a very mixed crowd that had a lot of energy.

    One last thing...  I was all ready to go out for one more slammin 
time on the dance floor when all of the sudden the lights went on.  
Apparently they wanted to have the party go longer but the Troc wouldn't 
let them.. Bummer..

    Anyways, it was cool to see a BUNCH of my friends there and a whole 
lot of SFravers too! :)

 Peace out and rave on and on and on and...

-Ernie ..dj Deaks..

In line at the troc, Todd and my two fellow space cheerleaders ask for

"iscool" and return to my spot. I guess bumble bee gloves and feliz the cat

this Balinese bell piece, that sounded like random noise, but slowly a

I ever expected! The lady next to us gave us some gum (thanx,  lady, I love
you bye-bye!) and the "performers" not only pulled the beat from deep
inside, they also had a great time doing it. Not smiling like holiday on
ice ads, but  real, happy,  manic,teeth producing smiles. All in all, about
5 or 6 percussion groups all heavily populated by women! A relief to me, I
thought it would be wirey guys in crew cuts wearing nothing but those
wedgies things and a smile....


Saturday's TRIBAL FUNK is gonna have a really, really diferent ambient
room, that may be the sole reason to go there(besides the main floor
line-up), from what Allen described; is Cheb-i-sabbah gonna be there as
well? 

So, this week starts on wednesday, so I guess the big adventure still goes on...


Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee...

ps. is there any after party on sunday? If not, I plan on getting the early
daylight on the beach, if anyone wants to join me in seagull watching.....

Mijos, I got this flier yesterday:

Cannabis action network's "harvest fair", a protest against the "SMOKE A
JOINT, LOSE YOUR LISCENSE" law, effective dec.1, requiring 6-month
suspension of your driver's liscense for possesion of marijuana, even the
first time, even a small amount[even in your back yard!]

It takes place SATURDAY DECEMBER 3, 12 noon to 5pm, at PEOPLE'S PARK, Berkeley. 
Cannabis action hotline is 510 486-8083
California NORML is 415 563 5858

Their events usaully have wonderful people and the usual hemp products and,
well,  you know, but it is a serious if fun event. 




I plan to attend, and anyone who wants to can join me, e-mail me and I'll
meet you there or at the bart.....time to stand up for Dona Maria Juana!

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....

Announcing the release of:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

THE OFFICIAL SFRAVES SCREENSAVER FOR WINDOWS v1.0:  Memories
by DJ Dave Alga
FILENAME: SFRSS10.ZIP
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Please support this new project!  This is the first release of
a screen saver for Windows that I wrote.  It's full of pictures
of raves, DJ's, flyers, and the people that make the parties
what they are today.  

This project will be updated regularly, with new pictures from
the latest parties.  Using the handy Logitech Fotoman digital
camera, we're going to be taking some pictures to add to the
project.  Instead of releasing a pack of pictures each week
(or whenever I decide to update it), I decided to release them
in a screen saver for Windows so you people could actually make
use of them!  Hopefully, I can obtain my own directory from 
hyperreal to store the latest releases, which will be announced
on the SFRaves mailing list.  For now, I will be uploading this
version, and future versions to hyperreal.com in the /incoming
directory.  

If you don't have a lot of hard drive space, and just want to 
see the latest pictures, I will also be releasing an upgrade 
version with each release that will just contain the latest
pictures to overwrite the old ones.  Grab this release now and
upgrade the next time I put out a new version.

This is the first pack I've done.  It's all pictures from the
hyperreal FTP site, because I didn't have any good pictures
from my Fotoman yet.  If you'd like to submit some shots to be
included in the next version, leave me mail and I'd be glad to
put them in a future release. 

So, grab it and check it out!  This release has some pictures 
of
my favorite flyers, and good shots of Jeno, Garth, Markie Mark,
and Bonnie Doon (9 pictures in all in v1.0).  Look forward to a
Tribal Funk upgrade next week, if I can take some good shots on
Saturday.  Look for us running around with the camera and meet
us.  Maybe you can be in the next screensaver.  

Have fun with the first one, and leave me mail with some 
suggestions for the future.  Any artists out there who want to 
design the opening screens, please leave me mail.  I'd love all
the help I can get on this.  Thanks for your support, and keep
the scene alive...

  Ok- I know...
this is NON RAVE RELATED....

But.. I think it is "of general interest"

About three months ago I posted a message about TIA, a program that allows
mortals like myself with lowly Netcom (and other) shell accounts to sample
the delicious fruits of the World Wide Web without paying big buckaroos
for the I.P.

Well.. I'm still doing that, and I love it..
(TIA is available from Marketplace.com.. for $25.00, the best $25.00
this cheap chump ever spent...)

Well, now theres a new program that may help people who havn't been
able to use TIA because their ISP wouldn't allow them to execute
programs on their host..

Don't know anything about this program.. but I just saw this..

Looks interesting.. If anyone tries it, please let me know how it works..

Thanks!
-Chris.

Followup-To: comp.infosystems.www.users

Organization: Kramer Communications
Lines: 103

SlipKnot (tm) is a graphical World Wide Web browser (similar to Mosaic) 
for Microsoft Windows users with dial-up UNIX shell accounts. MicroMind,
Inc. is releasing version 1.0 on November 22, 1994.
 
Its primary feature is that it does NOT require SLIP or PPP or TCP/IP 
services in any form (no TIA, no remsock, etc.).  It uses the user's 
ordinary dial-up UNIX shell account to retrieve and then paint WWW 
documents (including, of course, pictures and sound). 
 
See below for information on: 
Description, Features, Availability, Price, More information, Requirements 
and Limitations 
 
================ Description ======================================== 
SlipKnot was designed specifically for modem users with dial-up UNIX shell 
accounts.  It offers a terminal window (with vt100 emulation) into your 
UNIX session, allowing you to use your normal UNIX commands for mail, news,
gopher, etc. at any time (except during retrieval of WWW documents). 
 
At the press of a button, SlipKnot turns into a graphical WWW browser with 
features including: 
1. Up to 5 document windows available simultaneously. 
2. Background retrieval of documents from the Internet, while users can 
   scroll through previously retrieved documents, and perform other 
   operations. 
3. Ability to save entire documents (including the embedded pictures) into 
   user-definable folders. 
4. Ability to demonstrate the WWW offline (displaying the saved documents 
   with their links to each other). 
5. Ability to upgrade to newer versions of SlipKnot (when they become 
   available) through WWW links. 
6. Print documents (though not pictures, yet). Change preferred screen and
   printer fonts. 
7. Ability to install external "viewers" for processing pictures, sounds 
   and movies (two viewers, one for graphics and one for sound, already 
   come pre-installed). 
 
================ Availability ============================================ 
Check at your service provider first to see if it's available locally. If
not, it's downloadable from the following anonymous FTP sites (approx. 1.2
MB): 
 
ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel/win3/internet/slnot100.zip
or from:
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/pbrooks/slipknot/slnot100.zip 

Oakland has numerous mirror sites, so it should be widely available soon.
 
After downloading, please read the READ.ME file for Windows installation 
instructions. 
 
=============== Price =================================================== 
Restricted shareware (approx. 3 months evaluation time, depending upon use):  
US$29.95 for commercial users, and individuals in the U.S., Canada, Western
         Europe and Japan. 
US$20.00 for individuals elsewhere. 
(10% of registration fees donated to refugee relief). 
 
============== For more information ====================================== 
Point your WWW browser (lynx is fine) to  
    http://interport.net/~pbrooks/slipknot.html 
or send a blank email message to: 
    slipknot@micromind.com 
     
To facilitate communication and support, we suggest you post comments and
responses about SlipKnot ONLY to the following Usenet newsgroup: 
comp.infosystems.www.users

============== Requirements ============================================== 
On your PC: 
1. Windows 3.1+ running in 386 Enhanced mode (does not support 286 
   machines), Windows for Workgroups 
2. At least 4 MB of RAM (8 MB is recommended) 
3. Modem and a dial-up subscription to a UNIX-based Internet service 
   provider with shell account access (must have access to a shell prompt, 
   not a menu-based-only UNIX system) 
    
On your UNIX service provider's system: 
1. Your UNIX home directory must be writable 
2. One of the following two text-mode browsers must be available on your 
   UNIX system: "lynx" (version 2.2+) or "www" (SlipKnot uses one of these 
   programs for Internet file transport -- after which, SlipKnot will paint
   the documents and pictures and play the sounds retrieved). 
3. Access to ordinary UNIX commands like "ls", "echo", "chmod". 
 
================ Limitations (truth in advertising) ===================== 
1. SlipKnot will not process "forms" within documents yet (it is an HTML 
   1.0 browser). 
2. SlipKnot will not process "authentication" yet. 
3. SlipKnot understands the HTTP and FTP protocols only, no gopher, WAIS, 
   mailto, or news yet (although all of these are readily available in 
   SlipKnot's Terminal window into your UNIX session). 
4. SlipKnot is currently available only for Windows-based computers. 
   We may in the future developo versions for other platforms.

Where does everyone think the term "greek action" comes from?
A frat seems like the last stand of an antiquated "apprentice" style
domination that includes lots of homoerotic tension just under the surface.
Like marines, these guys get a lot of forced (but long lasting) bonding
with lots of disturbing (and unfulfilled)longings. I bet there are an
average of 5 "weird" dreams per frat per nite, involving their room-"mate"
(there go those words again!), themselves in pumps, and a naked clown. No
wonder they spend the day fearing those who mirror their nights....

But to all who would flame, hey, I'm shure you boys kept yer own sleeping
bags zipped all night. (wonder what goes on in a sorority?)

Lotsa provocation,
 Milton and the E-Bee..........

Mijos, I forgot! At kundalini, I witnessed the birth of a new raver.

Dig this: this 20 year old white guy, really clean cut, at his first party
and on his first x, sits near me and smiles HARD. He sez" it was so hard to
get any, everyone thought I was a narc, but my friend, she got me some"

next:"god, I love this place. Where do you all come from? What have I been
doing all my life? I should have been with you people long ago, wow, I
never knew these doors existed"

I LOVE it when a first timer actually looks inside and then around, besides
going around dancing, hugging, and puppy-piling...ahh, as long as this
still happens, the scene shall never die. 

And as he got up, to go dance, a blow pop, stuck to his pants. Great Spirit
bless him, he's one of the good ones.

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....

Taken from Cyber Sleaze For Wednesday November 23d 1994:

* A Dutch woman has gone on a crusade to prove that House
Music is a creation of the devil.
  JOKE HIETHBRIEK has founded a club which organises rave
parties during which she denounces to young people the
"satanic nature" of this popular form of dance music. 
  She says, "Satan is involved in this music...Look at them
showing off, you can't help noticing the satanic nature of house
music. When you go to these parties, it's obvious."

I use TIA every day.  Hooked has it installed for all of it's users.
Works with Mosaic, WSIRC, Netscape, WSFTP, FSP, and all of the
Winsock Slip applications.  It's great.  If you'd like information
about Hooked's service, call 415-281-6550.

People have asked me a few questions about the screen saver.  

#1:  Can you uuencode it to me?

Yes.  Mail me with your address.

#2:  Can you port it to the Mac?

No.  I'm not a very good programmer, and have no idea how to do this.
 If someone knows how, or has a module to use .SCR screen savers on
the Mac, please let me know.

#3:  Where is it?

Right now, it's available by ftp at hyperreal.com.  The directory is
/incoming, and the filename is SFRSS10.ZIP.

#4:  What's next?

Hopefully a Tribal Funk one this weekend.  Depending on how my
pictures come out and the lighting in the event.


Any more questions, please mail me.  Looking forward to hearing your
feedback about the first release.

What? Is this a JOKE?  Yeah, I guess it is.  Look everybody, it's a Dutch
Tipper Gore.  Thank God I have someone to tell me what's evil cause ya know,
I'm just way too tanked up on Little Debbies and Old Milwaukee (and God knows
what else the Devil's made me put in my system) to know what's right and
wrong for myself.

Poor, poor, frigid woman.  In Holland, no less.  I guess no ones ever given
her a big hug and some pixie stix before. :(  Ms. Hiethbriek, get thee to a
"coffeehouse" in Amsterdam right away!  Sit down and just breathe deeply for
a few minutes.  I'm sure you'll feel better about this whole thing then. :)

Saying that House music is a creation of the Devil is completely absurd. 
Michael Bolton, maybe...but definitely not house...

M told me it would be the last night of the Oakland run, regardless of the
day of the week, which would make it Monday this time.  But I don't know
at the moment what, if any, plans she and Ethan and Gil and the others who've
organized previous ones may have . . .

	If Netcom has a WWW browser and you are on a Unix box (but no 
SLIP cuz it's more expensive) You might want to look into a nifty little 
program called TERM... It basicly allows you to set your DISPLAY variable 
to your machine for processes running on the server (Or something like 
that)... An example, you log into the other machine, start term on both 
sides and then start xinit on the remote machine and lookie here, X pops 
up on your machine... I do not know too much about it, but I was getting 
yelled at for a while for not using it...

Personaly I don't think you can "get it" just by taking E at a party
(especialy nowadays). E makes you think EVERYTHING is so wonderfull,
whether you realy like it or mot. You would probably go up and hug Jesse
Helmes if you saw him on your first E. Inexperienced users tend to say & do
things they don't realy mean & usualy realize it when they come down. I
dont necesarily think that its any better for this guy to start going to
parties for the E, and faking it because he thinks its what he's supposed
to be doing, then to keep going to drunken college parties. IMHO the only
good reason to go out is for the music & the vibe, although I honestly think
both kinda suck nowadays. E is chemical love, why not try the real thing :)
p.s. medeiros, not tryin to put a damper on your positivity, I just got a
strong opinion on this (and almost everything else as you have probably
read) :>

 I'd have to disagree.  The first phat hit I took did, I believe, help me to
see the love and be a part of it all.  When I go to parties now, even if
there is no E, I feel less inhibited partly due to the x-perience.  How many
people on this list have delighted in their first trip and spent the entire
night dancing?  If he starts to go for the drugs and fakes it, then he'll
burn out soon enough.  However, it could be his doorway to what raving is all
about.  Let's give to boy a chance before we condemn him to a drunken stupor
a college party.
anyway, rave on my friends

not fancy the vibe of the evening EVEN when I have dosed an e. Again, 
blaming the drug for people's silliness or whatever you wish to call it 
is avoiding the problem....
	I often wonder about the "old days" when everything was 
underground and beautiful. I came into all of it at the tail end of it, 
and the people I began going out with do not go out at all anymore. 
THings have changed a bit, I will give them that. But in a lot of ways, I 
tend to look at my old friends in a different light, because they are not 
willing to put the energy into making a party go off like they used to. 
Who were the people who made the go off? Certainly not the people who are 
sitting around go "The old days... AHHHHHH yesss, today is just 
shit....". While the old days were cool, they are past, and maybe the 
energy spent on whining about that fact would be of better use at a party?
Ach, but then again, they amount of time that I whine about the UK/Europe 
and the such could make a hundred parties go off just like those ;)

LEAP!  Or get the correct permits or pay those men in blue their, um, just
due or whatever you gotta do but DO NOT let the beat stop till the morning
comes.  I REALLY hate being dumped out on the street at 3:00am - it just
brings you down and it plain sucks.  Fortunately, I was with a large group of
friends with tons of positive attitude and we were able to do the "let's all
go to someone's house and spin records" thing which was more fun anyway in
many ways.  Yeah, I know DV8 is DV8. Why ask Why? What do you expect, ya
shoulda known better and its true, I do. I'll learn some day.  Standard
non-moving line delay tactic till price increase at midnight(no suprise, it
was obvious from the info provided but one can hope.) Kinda Spundaes crowd I
guess with some familiar faces mixed in.  If that was Simon spinning 12 -1?
then he has definately gotten better since the last time I heard him.  Not
sure who was spinning after Simon(too much damn fog crud) but there was some
cool "intelligent" type stuff for awhile that I was groovin on.  
Markie started off strong but I don't think the feedback factor was too high
even if there wasn't that massive vibe-proof glass encased DJ booth.  And
then the dreaded *NO SOUND* (it can really hurt if you have, like, one leg in
the air and you're off balance and the beat stops .)  Almost immediatley ya
got security screaming typical "PARTIES OVER GET THE F**K OUT!!!" crap.
Ooga Booga has a killer line up(they added Garth, Grahme, and someone else
too) but I think its at DV8 too(both floors) and I'm not having the warmest
feelings for that place right now(not that I ever did anyway.) 

 Just be thankful for what you've got...(tribal funk, right?)

Slipknot was easy , and I saw the ameba home page for the first time 
(thoughtport.com) its like driving a yugo on the information 
superhighway. Its very windows.

However I cant find this sfraves screen saver anywhere.

Hey man, don't fall into the trap of waxing nostalgic for the past. Sure it
was great, but i'd bet that your newness to the scene at the time had at
least something to do with it. It was percisely the "silliness" of those
parties in 91 that made them so great. At the time it was new to almost
everyone, hence the parties were filled with that fresh energy and vibe you
see from first timers.

Follow your own advice:
 While the old days were cool, they are past, and maybe the
>energy spent on whining about that fact would be of better use at a party.

All I have to say is that phuture was right.   He posted on Wednesday (I 
think) about the asshole security guards at DV8.  
Well, Ooga Booga happened friday nite at DV8 and before the event even 
happened, things were going wrong.
My boyfriend and I got there at about 8:30 to help set up and visit and 
by about 9:30 the security guards began to ID everybody inside the 
building who were setting up. There were some who didn't bring their ID's 
and were immediatly thrown out.  Most everybody in there was from 
Sacramento, so they couldn't just run home and get their lisence.  I 
knoww that they SHOULD have brought their ID's anyway, because a club is 
a club.
Then, after people began stressing on what to do about the situation, the 
owners of the club suddenly decided to make the bottom floor 18 and up 
and the top floors 21 and over only. Frank (one of the two main guys who 
is oogabooga) was ready to shut the whole thing down right then because 
it was nearly 10 as it was and the main dj's, the ambiant lounge, lasers 
and best stuff like that were all upstairs where the majority of the 
crowd would be under 21.  Well, a compromise was made and it would be 18+ 
on all floors after 2 a.m.
So now everyone is on edge and the party begins.  There wasn't many 
people there - they could have gotten way more people if they kept it in 
Sacramento and would have been able to cut their costs way down.
There was NO vibe.
Except in one room where my friend Pierre and his girlfriend Heather were 
doing visuals.  Some of us hung out there and it was nice.  
Heather had told me that she had bought a WATER for *$1* and was going 
upstairs with it and the security guards made her THROW IT AWAY!!!  She 
hadn't even taken a sip yet!!  Then the s.g.'s  began TUGGING on  all the 
wristbands of 21+ people going upstairs to make sure they hadn't been 
taken off and put on someone younger.
Upstairs was Garth.....spinning some pretty good stuff to an empty 
dancefloor!! It was rather pathetic seeing San Francisco's best with no 
one to appreciate him......
I had heard that some kind of crack down happened at DV8 last week and 
that security had to be beefed up - and I can understand that.  But these 
goons were pushing it to the limit.  They REALLY killed any good energy 
there and we left WAY early and spent time with our friends in Berkeley.
I won't be back to DV8.....ever.
I got a flyer for Kenetic that was happening that night too.  Did anyone 
go? What did I miss?
luv to all,
Amy

Okay. I've been wanting the new Doran tape ever since he told me about it 
at the last Basics.  Well, Sacramento doesn't carry Doran's mix tapes, so 
I must journey to THE CITY to get to my pot of gold.  So we're in 
Berkeley and I stop at Primal.....and they're sold out (noooo!!!!) 
Next stop - Ameba on Haight. My boyfriend is grumbling about the fact 
that he has to drive out of his way for me and I just tell him to be 
quiet :)
We get there and it's 7:45. Looks like they're closed.  I peer thru the 
window and ask the guys inside.  Yup. They're closed.  So I forlornly 
turn to leave and the door opens and one of the guys graciously (sp?) 
lets me in.
My point?  I want to thank the guys at Ameba for helping me out and let 
everyone on the list know what they know already.  You guys are the coolest!
ps - the tape is teriffic!!
Thanks again,
Amy

    argh....i've been waiting quite a while for this party....i've been 
telling my friends to go.....i call the number and it is going to be at
the cow palace.  this pretty much goes against every moral fiber in my
body.  maybe i have the wrong attitude, but i thought only cool world (no
offense) would do something like this.  well, now i'm caught in a moral 
dilema....although i've never been to the cow palace, i've only heard
bad things about the space.  if there is a group that could possibly
overcome this, it would be tribal funk....oh well...decisions..decisions..
water bottles will be confiscated (but they _sell_ water inside).
$6.00 for parking....i want to go, but it looks like come-unity might
be a better choice.  unless it is 21+  then i'm screwed again....
oh well...i just thought i'd vent.  sorry for waisting bandwidth....

greetings friends,

i got to 174 king street for Come/Unity a little before 3am, and thought as i  
walked up to the door, "my it seems loud tonight."  just a few folks in line,  
polite but thorough patdown search, ID check, $15, and i was in.  garth was  
playing to a pretty full house, just shy of being too crowded.

i quickly inserted ear plugs and went to explore the dance floor.  was  
surprised that it was so loud, even with plugs.  if consumer reports were  
rating this rave, i think they would deem it NOT ACCEPTABLE on account of  
this hazard alone, its other merits notwithstanding.  being pretty certain  
that people without hearing protection were accumulating irreversible hearing  
damage put a bit of a damper on my mood.

i could tolerate being dead center on the dance floor (not too near any of  
the loudspeaker stacks or bass bins), but it felt much better to be on the  
main floor by the walls, well behind the speakers, or up on the balcony.   
more room to dance there anyway.  can anyone else confirm that it was *way*  
loud in there, or was it just me?

on to the merits:  clean sound.  not terribly smoky.  plastic cup free for  
the asking (water from the tap in the bathroom).  found some pockets of warm,  
smiley energy.  music good enough to keep me dancing nearly all the while.   
was running low on steam around 5, thinking of leaving, when jeno came on &  
played some really dance-motivating music - snappy, energizing rhythms  
alternated with smoother, trancier tracks.  when i left around 6:30 the  
congregation had thinned a little but there were still lots of people there,  
and some really beautiful, free-spirited dancing on the main floor.

i'm glad some of the proceeds from this event will go to the malachy healing  
fund.  i wonder - when will there be benefit raves to equip soundblasted  
ravers later in life with hearing aids and to teach them sign language?

I'll second rnj's comment about the sound levels at Come/Unity.  My ears
are ringing a little right now and that is *not* cool.  I wore earplugs
most of the time and definitely while in the zone between the speakers.
Also -- this is getting to be consistent and annoying -- Jeno was driving
things so hard it was definitely distorting, whereas it was fairly clean
during Simon's set.

I got in around 4 and stayed until the end.  Been a while since I've been
in King St, so it was nice to get back to one of my longtime haunts, and
it really wasn't too crowded or hot or smoky for a change, which was nice.
And while I got a good workout on the floor, it just didn't get off in my
view, maybe C/U has to be at 1015 for that to happen, really.  Simon played
a pretty consistent acid house set and Jeno stuck more to the swirling
diva vocals, but I have to say, maybe it's just me but neither set really
lit any fires.  I missed out on Simon's first go and Garth, though, so other
mileage may vary.

  I went to Tribal Funk last night along with a good number of other
 sfravers. Crunch, Bryce, Todd, Ernie were faces I knew. Met Jason, Amy &
 finally Milton ( keep those entertaining posts flowing ). At first, I
 had some concern about "Cow Palace event" but the crowd was nice and
 everyone was into the rave scene IMHO. Candy given out, nice visuals,
 lasers, strobes, fog all came out to greet. Overall I give it thumbs
 up for crowd vibes and environment.. however...

 It sure was LOUD. I wore earplugs most of the night and my ears are 
 still ringing. Even though the room was very large there were large
 speaker stacks everywhere and I noticed that in many areas the sound
 was so intense that you could feel your whole body vibrate in the
 sound field. Unfortunately, ear drums are tiny, sensitive body parts
 and if my bones are vibrating then what chance do eardrums have ? Oh
 well...

 I still personally enjoy the small more condensed gatherings with sound
 that is loud but not dangerously so.. F&F as a perfect example :-) These
 feel more like a party while the larger gatherings feel more like a
 partying "city" - at least to me. But I am sure that BOTH have their
 place! Now if they just adjusted the sound better....

I had a great time. I enjoyed it earlier though when the place wasn't so 
packed.

    well, i decided to go to tribal funk and i would like to apologize for
my earlier post about the cow palace.  wow...i had a great time.  i really
liked the fact that if you arrived before 10:30, you _actually_ only had
to pay $15.  usually when promoters say that, the line doesn't start 
moving until right before the deadline, but they had it worked out so
you bought your ticket and then waited in line....anyways, when i entered
the south hall, i flashed back to the raves i went to a couple of years 
ago...lasers, many screens of visuals, some cool black light drawings,
lights, etc...and most of the people were really friendly.  it's obviously
difficult for such a large crowd to be friendly, but i thought the 
hug/smile quotient was quite high.  i saw so many friends (some that i
hadn't seen in a very long time =) and i even saw a lot of sfravers...
milton, dave, deaks, brian, bryce, todd, cap'n crunch, john...(i'm sorry if
i forgot someone)...i thought donald glaude was insane....he was incredible.
i definately have to see him spin again. 
  i thought the sound was too loud at times.  but i've heard that that 
usually happens with the shredder sound system.  i must admit that it's
always kinda weird to feel my entire body vibrate to the bass...anyways,
i've written enough (i think)......  i can't wait to go to f&f 5   =)

Hi all!  My friend Dave and I went out to ComeUnity Sat. night.  They had 
it at the King St. garage, a place i'd never been before.  It was great! 
A big dance floor and balconey's around the sides where you could sit and 
hang out.  It was just the RIGHT # of people, too.  Everyone seemed 
perfectly at ease and ready to dance.  Yay!

We got there around midnight... we wanted to make sure 
we'd get to hear Dubtribe, and I wasn't sure when they were going on.

Wow!  They were so right on!  I loved it!  I've liked them  ever since 
I first heard one of their songs  for the first time at a Halloween 
Full Moon rave.  I WANT MY PLANET BACK!  It's the coolest kind of rave 
song 'cause it makes you think and feel strong and positive, and, uh, of 
course, you can dance to it!

I heard them play at a Spundae once at the DV8.  After reading just now 
about the problems Ooga Booga had there, I don't feel so weird about not 
really liking that place.  Because when Dubtribe played there their 
performance got kind of lost in the vibelessness of the place.  Now I 
know that a club CAN have a vibe, because ComeUnity did.  I just couldn't 
believe how artful and smooth they were at ComeUnity.  I never thought 
you could perform techno live.  They were fabulous! A vibe unto themselves. 

Another cool thing about ComeUnity was getting to see some poeple I 
haven't seen in a long time, because I've been being a hardworking 
student girl and haven't been going out much.  Hi Bill, Gaby, Lynn, Jake, 
Peter!  I also met Derek Chung and Lavonne, from San Jose, who told me 
about what some of the things that were going on in the scene in "days 
gone by."

A reflection:  I do research at Cal, and sometimes it trips me out to 
realize how quickly people's attitudes and beliefs change in modern 
biology, because we are learning new things all the time.  Seems like a 
theory will hold sway for only a year or so before it becomes "fact" or 
gets repudiated.  Creepier still is that there is so much knowledge that 
isn't even taught anymore, because it isn't really relevant to the 
questions biologists are addressing at the moment.  The "scenes" in 
science and in modern biology are similar 'cause they are changing so 
fast.  Songs come and go, parties start up, grow and then die, people go 
through phases where they go out lots and lots and then don't and then 
do...like in biology, kind of, where you see one lab publish a bunch of
papers and then you don't hear from them again for a couple of years.  
Even in biology, people drop in and out of the scene a lot.
 Maybe the future of society is that we are all going to belong to
different organic "scenes," professional and otherwise, that are in
constant flux.  Maybe it's like that already, and I just didn't notice it! 

Seems like lots of you sfravers went to Tribal Funk!  Hi!  Hopefully I'll 
get to see some more of you at the Pacific party next weekend, which 
looks like it will be awesome.  I can't wait to hear Galen spin again!

lotsa love,

ann/thrax

I got to Come/Unity relatively early.  There was still lots of space on the
dance floor must have been between 12:00-12:30.  I met right away with
Brian Mcgonicle who was already at it on the dance floor.  From then on I
danced wildly all night and stopped only a couple of times for a drink.

By the way thanks Brian for informing me that Dubtribe had just started
their LIVE set.  I've heard the name many time but had never heard their
music.  Talk about great trancy dance music.  The vocals/chants with the
ever hard driving beat was so hypnotising.  I danced in front of them for
all their set.  The Bongo player accompanying them was awsome.

Even after their set and Garth? started spinning, I thought the vibe was
absolutely terrific.  People were dancing with everyone, smiling, being
friendly and having lots of fun.  It felt so good I even gave some tired
dancer a small back message right on the dance floor :)

Talking about bongos.  Someone brought a bongo and placed it in the middle
of the dance floor.  Woww!  I got to play it for a long time (thanks to
whomever brought it) and other people joined in too which made it lots of
fun.  Although, I did bruise my hands a little from playing too long.

As far as the sound, yes it got very loud by the time I left at 4:00.  But
I thought it (the sound) was good and clean until then.

All in all a fun party.

PS.: I met George and Vera.  They are the most enlightning couple.  They
love to dance to great House music (although he did mention that the trance
music being played was a little hard for them to dance to) and George even
told me he is 70 years old.  Hats off to them!  I guess it goes to show
that it doesn't matter how old you are it's what you have in your heart.

    OBITAL:  We got into LA around 1 pm. Killed time until 9 when we 
headed over to the Shrine. Beautiful building. The line was short & 
started moving soon after our arrival, lots & lots of secuirity, plus 
cops and even a firefighter. But no one was rude. JUNGLE! A few different 
DJs played jungle for a few hours.(no one seemed to know their names.) IT 
WAS INSANE! I danced to it, on & off. Most people were just standing 
looking at the amazing visuals. More speaker bunnies than I've ever seen. 
Will they be able to hear at 35? Orbital played beautifully. I looked 
around and it seemed everyone was dancing until they started playing some 
of their more mellow stuff. BUt that was welcomed after all the jungle. I 
danced until around 4, when I  could not push my body any further. THe 
last dj was playing hard acid, none of this happy, light morning music. 
I had lotsa stereo types about LA, some seemed to be true, but maybe I 
was looking for them. People did appear more obsorbed in heir apperance, 
but I also met MANY people ready with hugs & smiles. It was a commercial 
event, complete with vending tables in the outside area, a virual reality 
booth, & expensive tickets( don't ask I don't want to talk about it). I 
had to be talked into to going becuz I was bent on going to Tribal Funk, 
But I am more than happy w/ my choice to see ORBITAL. Amazing lasers, 
stunning visuals, decent sound, some incredible and some crazy music, 
friendly people, and some E for &15. My jacket didn't even get stolen.

The sound systems at 174 King street and its much larger neighbor 177
Townsend are some of the best on the West Coast (according to a number of
the DJs I've spoken to).  The one at Townsend is particularly special.
Someone once told me that these systems are pretty sensitive, tho... and
thus are probably prone to distort when pushed too far.

Geoff once told me that at a Wicked in Townsend (way back in the old days),
Garth melted down some of the copper cabling to the speakers...

Well It wasn't copper cabling but I did see the driver on one of the
bass bins overheat and melt, it was one of the best Wickeds ever :)
BTW this was only about a year and a half ago, people need to stop waxing
nostalgic and start creating the Scene anew, It seems like people like to
throw around the words P.L.U.R. but we are lacking in PRACTICE.

Well Come Unity was LOUD...

I NEVER wear ear-plugs.. my ears having being shredded to pieces already...
however, there were only a few spots on the floor that were comfortable...
At one stage I was considering the old trick of bumming 2 cigarettes and putting
the filters in my ears :) ... but then my ears sorta got used to it :)

BUT... Dubtribe were phucking amazing... never saw them before...
Garth and Simon were both mesmerizing...
and Jeno was just sorta average.. Is it just me or is he better on a 4.00AM slot?
(no "drug peaking" remarks...please :)

Hi to ravnbird, who was in great form, and to Gaby and Bill... who just sorta sways all 
nite with a BIG grin on his face :)

HUGGIES

Well, I'd have to say Tribal Funk really pulled it off!  I was very impressed
with everything they did.  I've never been to the cow palace before and I
wasn't dissappointed.  A bit apprehensive at hearing that it was such at
large space but it proved to be one bitchin' party.   I was walking around
the dance area at one point and I must of had a smile on my face because this
guy walks up to me with a big smile and sez ,"hey man I'm almost there too!"
 and hugs me!  I talked with him for a few minutes and met his friends!  I
was completely caught off guard at such friendliness!  Just one of the pieces
of the puzzle that made TF a great party.  Met Dave Alga (and a friend of
his, can't remember his name) taking pictures of Tony for the screen savers.
 If I was to complain, it would have to be that I danced to the bassline
rather than the actual music for some time.  But since I'm not
complaining...great party!  I'm glad I decided to go to TF at the last
minute.  I wasn't let down!

Willis, 

It was one hell of a party. I only wish I would have been able to  
dance a bit, instead of checking ID the whole night (but I still had
a GREAT time!!!!! Did anyone else have a good time as well ? 

I've been told that another one is being planned. I CAN'T WAIT!!!!

'We shall Overcome'
the cowpalace
Ba BOOM ... boom Cha

I was excited to go to Tribal Funk
after a really nice free party this summer.
I was more than willing to cough up the $20
for a great big monster bash.

I was happy about the 'fully permitted' business
but hesitant to go to the Cow Palace.  Having never
been, I thought if anyone could do it, it would be
Tribal Funk.  Street parking was free and easy.
It was wierd seeing the party name up in lights.

I'm tempted to give this my Best Dressed Rave Award 1994.
The Beautiful were out in force - funky costumes entertain
me to No End, though.

Got there around 1 with Old School Emily and Harrison Ford.
We walked right in.  Nice ante room chill area, hallway opened
into the giant dance area, an immediate left u-turn was the
pacific ambient room - I don't know who was playing around 5
in the colorful overalls but it was tweaky/funky and dead on.
Some rave market booths.  Security was mellow.  $water and food.

6 big screens that each turned into its own dance floor.
I think you audiophiles would have just dropped dead with horror.
The 3000 ft ceilings are probably an acoustic nightmare - I thought
the djs were making a good effort to adapt and for the most part
pulled off that muddy massive rumble cha cha rave stylee funk.

Immediately ran into sfr Kathryn and posse for some hugs, belly rubs(!),
and full on stealth lotion attacks (in the nicest way).  Whoa!  How did
my hands get so slimy dancing here?

Everything was so spread out that dancing was fairly unfocused.
I had a hard time getting into it - after a little while, I basically
gave up and proceeded to have a lovely time chatting with people.  I 
would say that the friendly happy vibe was High but the Get Down and
Work It vibe was low.  Small outside area was the quietest spot in the 
party.  I am reminded of a fashion center Event 2 or 3 years ago.
Honestly, I think one big party every few years is about all I
can handle.

With all the recent talk of 14 year olds I can't help but relate
the story about my 27 year old friend and this cute young (14, I swear) 
raver girl who would *really* like to get to know him.  This is, of course,
a Much Bigger Concern for my friend than for the girl.  IMO she has her
head together.  Opinions and advice have been All Over the Map on this
one - yours are welcome.

After a nice evening having coffee with friends we went by Kinetic. 
Map point and it felt like a break-in.  Easy capitalists.  Nice spot
but it didn't take off.  Music was average at best.  Sometimes I just
don't want to get in trouble - so I left early.

A Raving Thanksgiving Weekend
=============================


Kenitic (A weekly on Friday evenings)
-------------------------------------

This weekend,  I finally got the chance to check out Kinetic...   I was
really impressed.     The space,  although not very large,  provided a
very secure bust proof location.    When I arrived there,   I wasn't
even sure I had the correct address.   There was just NO SOUND audible
from the street.    After entering,  I found out why.    It was set
way in the back,  down in a basement.    The only problem with the 
space is the low celeings.   For non-smokers,  it was a bitch.   I
was constantly having to leave the flush out my lungs,   but it stayed
cool down there all night long.    

The first DJ that came on was a little inexperienced,   and there were
lots of breaks in the beat,  as well as a few mess ups on the meat matching,
but when Tracey got on,   the groove suddenly improved.   All night long,
the groove was improving.    At first,  they had a problem with one of the
speakers,   but it was corrected long before Tracey got on the turntables.
After Tracey went on,   there was some Jungle and BreakBeat.   WOW!!  We
don't get much of that here...   But was totally welcome as far as I'm
concerned.    Quite a few California weenies sorta stood on the sidelines,
for that set.

The last DJ,  normally performing in the LA area,  was absolutly amazing.
Thomas Michael literally tore up the place BIG TIME.   His technical 
mixing was superb,  and the musical trip throughout his set was literally
seamless.    There was NO BREAKS in the beat,   which kept me dancing like
the mad-man fool I was,  all night long until the very end.

Afterwards,   we headed out for breakfast,   and romped around town all
day long.   No chance to get any sleep,   or even to settle down and
meditate a few hours.    It was just non-stop going from place to place.


Tribal Funk
-----------

Later towards the day,    we headed out for the Cow Palace for Tribal Funk,
as Radion and my other friends were doing the chill space.    There are
great advantages to doing chill spaces.    One great advantage is having
access to the fine pillows many hours before the gig got started.   I actually
got in at least an hour of uninterrupted chill and meditation time,  dispite
the flurry of activity around me,   as folks were setting things up.   After
meditating,  I even had time to do my Yoga/Thai Chi thingie before they
opened the doors.   At one point,  they kicked everyone out unless they
had something to do with the party,    as Flash went around making sure those
that were there had something to do with the party,  and got on the list.

At 10 pm,  the doors finally opened,  and people were streaming in.   For
those arriving,   there was this long hallway formed by curtains on each
side,  with electronic and space music playing,  and TV monitors displaying
spacey video,  and black lights,  enhancing the slogens and paintings on the
sides.   Straight ahead was the main dance area which was HUGE.    All 
4 sides had HUGE speaker banks,  but the acoustics of the concrete and
steel space caused the sound to be very muddy and mushy and LOUD.    As long
as you stayed within the square area,  marked on each corner with the super
large speaker system,   you got all that acoustical energy.    Ear plugs were
definately necessary.   The sound energy was awsome....   Dispite the 2nd
sleepless night,   I had energy to spare,  although I did have to help out
on the chill area during the first half of the rave.    I was able to slip out
and dance.

Tibal Funk was BIG...   Probably one of the biggest massives I've been to,
although I don't know about Cool World.   It was an all ages event,  but 
dispite that,   the vibe was exceptionally good.  Although the gangsta 
types were present, and several "Rap circles" formed in the dance area,  
there was plenty of good vibe to go around.     As usual,  my mission was 
to spread as much luv and energy around as possible,  and I certainly had 
lots of success with that.    Even the younger dudz brightened up,  as I 
had eye contact with them....   Another thing that really made my evening 
was the availability of food,  although not the most nutritious,  it was 
priced reasonably,  and really picked up my energy at around 5 am or so.

Ins and outs were not really necessary,  as they had a chill area outside 
set up for those who wanted to smoke.   Although the Cow Palace  was 
non-smoking venue, nobody payed attention,  unless someone tried to light 
up under the noses of security,  who were quick to inform those of the 
non-smoking policy.

Cops and security were present and very visible,   but everyone knew it,  and
people doing more illicit things were very discrete about it.  Although I was
not everywhere at once,   I've heard of no busts or problems.

DJ Utopia started things off at opening time,   and although I had to spend
time in the chill area doing massages,  and helping out,   I did manage to
break free just in time to hear DJ Dan scratch up the place with his insane
scratching.   Everone just WENT OFF big time,  with the rap circles in full
swing.    After that,  Mark Farina had everone cheering,  as he played new and
old favorites,  keeping up the beats.   I went totally insane... as I usually
do.

Towards the very end,   working from that food I had eaten earlier,  my energy
level started to pick up,    and I found the SFRavers area,  near one of
the corner speakers,  and hopped around like a total fool.   Althoug the
SFRave quotent wasn't the highest,  a significant number of them were present.

Video in the Chill room was done my Greg Jalbert, a Mac programmer who wrote
Bliss Paint,  was sitting there all evening,  providing the chillers with some
super duper EYE CANDY...   Excellent stuff...  Synergy was in the main area,
and they had no less than 4 video screens in the main area.   two lazers,  one
red and one green,  provided excellent visuals.

I think the Cow Palace (And the price $20) scared away most self respecting raver,
and I KNOW I couldn't attend unless I could get in for free.   But it was worth 
the extra 3 hours of work I had to do,  and I'm sure those tired ravers appreciated
having me remove their "energy blockages".

In the last hour,  I was dancing ALL the time,   except for ocassional cool-off
breaks to dry off.    Towards the end,  the lights went on,   and by that time,
I was going full blast,  like there was no tommorrow.   Younger dudes were 
cheering me on,  at least those who haven't seen me before.   Those on the 
sidelines,  were so totally hosed,  they could barely walk,   much less get up 
and dance.   I was able to pursuade a few of the younger dudes to get up and
dance,  but most just shook their heads in total amazement and couldn't 
even CONSIDER moving.

The music finally stopped,   but shortly afterwards,   the DJ agreed to play 
one more song.   Knowing this,  I danced like there was no tommorrow,
hopping around like mad.    With each beat,  I barely touched the ground,  and was
in the air most other times.   Unfortunately,  the earths gravity was too weak
to pull be down fast enough to catch the next beat... :-)  I was hopping so high.

After that,  everyone sorta walked around in a daze,  gathering up their stuff,
and saying goodby,   etc.    For those who couldn't make it,  I'm sorry you missed
this massive event.  I've still got a super grin on my face from all the joy and

hey y'all--i meant to tell you about this last week but i've been super 
busy lately... after everyone's comments on markie's set at the last 
wicked i was really curious to see what he'd play in new york (where 
hardcore is more the norm and "jungle rulez") anyway, after a long night 
in a warehouse in queens where i witnessed more people more fucked up on 
more drugs than i've ever seen in my life and where i got a decent taste 
of some intense intense jungle from frankie bones and other ny djs, i 
headed back to manhattan to catch the after hours party where markie was 
supposed to be playing... i met some cool folks that morning but for the 
most part the vibe was pretty lame--sort of a strung out feel, mediocre 
music etc...what do you expect at 11am, huh?  it got better though and 
some more people showed up--some of them had been asleep all night, so i 
think that picked the vibe up a little.  And i gotta say, markie's set 
worked wonders--he played mostly trancey stuff that my friend praised as 
"very san francisco" and then went into some harder stuff toward the 
end...i'm still working on learning how to dance to that stuff--everyone 
here on the east coast seems just fine with it--they seemed to 
like the west coast style part of the set too--there was a 
noticeable increase in dancing smiling etc...overall markie's 2 hour 
set made the party, not to mention my weekend.  thanks to all who sent me 
info about that event--see y'all back in sf soon...--jessica

Tribal Funk was just absolutely un-fucking-believable. Simply amazing.  
This is the rave that I've been waiting for, for what seems like forever.
Tribal Funk has always thrown great parties in the past and their one 
year anniversary promissed to be extra special. At first there were all 
these rumors that it was gonna be $25, but I kinda felt like that was Ok 
since everyone owed Triobal Funk.  They threw so many free or $3 parties 
this summer and have put a lot of effort into giving people a good time.
	when I go there it was nearly 10:30 and the line was quite long.  
I thought we would haveta pay extra for sure but instead everyone in line 
got their hand stamped so it was all good. The space was really really 
big..... and really really good. Lots of positive messages in flourescent 
paint in the front, lotsa lasers, 6enormous screens of visuals, (4 of 
them by synergy), lotsa trippy lights, an amazing chill room 
area.......basically this rave had the works. This guy had a booth set up 
and was selling peace necklaces.  He said that he's made someting like 
78,000 of them!!!!  One thing that Tribal Funk had that most raves of 
this size usually don't was a great vibe.  People were smiling 
everywhere, giving out candy, wearing costumes, and just basically being 
friendly.  Of course there were quite a bit of the gangsta types there 
too but I guess that their $$$$ were kinda necessary to throw such a rad 
party.  The dj's played quite well and there was this one song that must 
of been played at least 5 or six times that night(if anyone knows what 
i'm talking about,it's kinda hard to describe but really obvious, I'd 
love to know what song that is!).  The outside space was kinda nice to go 
to and just relax in altho it was quite dirty(cigarette butts everywhere.)
All in all this rave was really positive and definitely lots of fun!!

Oh, and despite the voicemail message, my water was *not* confiscated! =)

HAPPINESS IS BEING AMONG FRIENDS

70?!!!  That's killer!  I always say that I'll still be raving when I'm that
age (if I live that long), and I think most people say similar things about
not letting age affect them, but to actually meet people who have stayed
that much younger than their years...that's cool.  People like that are
always so centered, you can't help but pick up some serious positive energy
off them.  I mean they must have tons of it to be able to disregard what
people their own age are saying about them.  It's not like they can call up
George and Ethel and say, "Hey, let's go dance our noodles off!"  They
probably have no other 70 year old friends who rave.  All I have to say is
that's extremely cool.

	A very good friend of mine is finally escaping from iowa to
the sf area, and we were wondering if any sfrave-people had space
available for her to room with 'em for a few months... 

	If any of you know me.. I put my entire 'reputation' on the
line saying that she's Really Cool. ;-)

  While there was a DJ scratching and playing an amazing high NRG set at 
T-Funk, it was not Dan.  It was Donald Glaude from Seattle, one of my 
favorite DJ's and by far the most entertaining DJ to watch (imho)

  DJ Dan played at Orbital, even though T-Funk kept telling me he would 
be in SF.  I figure the people in LA just had more money to offer him.  
MY friend told me he shreaded down there :)

Dj Dan *WAS* at Tribal Funk.  I talked to him for a few minutes, and
if you download the new screen saver, you'll see a picture of him
tearing up the turntables.  He did a great job...

Love supreme/On the Move was definitely a large party for San Jose.  Set 
inside a German restaurant which looked to be an old mansion-style house 
in downtown SJ.. when I first walked in to the main dance area it felt 
like the Shining.  It was so eerie and the lights were minimal. A lone 
disco mirror ball hung in the center of the room, scattering 
light-squares in circular fashion about the room.  the large area seemed 
to be perfect for a union of Motion goers as well as Ajax Loungers to 
shake the ole booty.

Not many people dancing early, but the crowd steadily grew from 11-12 
and then personal space became a hot commodity. What's with all the 
bumping?  Hey everyone's dancing with their drinks,
Hey, that guy just spilled his drink on me...
Hey there's drinks spilled all over the floOOOOOOOOrrrrr... wow close call.
More bumping... hey intimacy is nice, but c'mon, that eblow is sharp.

Strange mix of visuals, computer animations contrasted by black and white 
footage of a man feeling up some woman (clip from some movie).  What is 
the meaning?  I liked the slide that just says "Greetings".

Lots of attractive people... lots of bystanders also... lots and lots of 
sticky floor really gummed up my feet and I all of a sudden found myself 
tired during Jeno's set.  Even "Waitiiiin - for You" couldn't save me this 
time.  People really packed this party, though, and that made it good.  

I didn't make it to the acid-jazz room with Julius and Harry, tho.  I was 
scared of passing the "bar gauntlet" to get to the back room for some 
reason.  I think I have this phobia of the physical structure of a bar.  
Maybe I should watch the movie "Cocktail" for therapy...

If anyone has read this message this far, I have a flyer for another SJ 
event.

I'd heard about the Orbital show a while before it happened.  My friend
Mark was kind enough to pick up a pair of tickets for me and my SO, and
we would be in town anyway for Turkey Day at Jen's parents.

Friday night we drove down to the UCI radio station to hear the show that
evening.  Mark lured us with the promise of a live show in the college
pub, but he told us once we were on the road that it was only in the radio
station.  Monty spun for the first hour and played a funky trancey techno
set, I'm not too sure what else to call it.  His stint ended with an
interview where he gave his opinion on jungle techno; if any of you heard,
it was pretty funny!  Joe Rice was next, and he spun an excellent set of
trance (for want of a better word).  It was one of the best sets I've
heard from both fellows.  While there I met Joachim, Brian B.'s
counterpart in SoCal.  I also heard the story of Dana's
switch of majors; if you haven't heard, ask him!

Saturday day was a (very rare) clear day in the LA basin, so we went for
a hike in the nearby Santa Monica mountains.  After an hour or two of
climbing we were rewarded with a panoramic view of snowy mountains,
reservoirs, and cookie cutter homes like Edward Scissorhands.

We got to the venue (the Shrine auditorium, near USC) about 10 pm.
LA's finest were making their presence felt by cruising by at 4 mph in
that cop-style "I know you're doing something wrong, but I can't do
anything about it now, so I'm going to try to scare you into making
a mistake so I can search you."  I realize that it was the intended
effect, but I still got pretty jumpy.  Too many horror stories from
too many people to not be afraid of the LAPD.

Security was omnipresent but fortunitely not omniscient.  We had to make
a few attempts at getting in the door:

"Whazzat?"
"A pipe."
"You can't bring that in.  You can take it back to your car, though."
(Trudge, trudge, tuck, wiggle, trudge, trudge.)

"Whazzat?"
"A water bottle."
"No water allowed."
(Dump, pour, girgle.)

"No empty bottles either."
(Sound of plastic hitting plastic in trash can.)

"Whazzat?"
"Oh, nasal decongestant, for my stuffed nose."
"Ok, go on in."
(!!!)

The sound was alright, about as good as it can get in a large indoor event.
It was booming and echoing off of the walls, but the base was definitely
there and it wasn't painfully loud.

The visuals throughout the evening were superb.  They were a mix of
computer animation (kinda neet, not really), some colorful kaleidascope
type stuff, cool three color film clips (black, white, and say blue),
video clips of whales breaching and the likes, and fast slide-projector
type words flashing by.

We came in to some breakbeat/hardcore which changed to jungle at about 10pm.
(I'm not sure if there was a DJ change.)  Noone was really dancing, maybe
about 1 in 20 was pretending to for about 5 minutes at a time, except
for about 50 Speakr Tweakrs who reminded me of the floor at an overcrowded
Sonic Youth show at the Warfield once.  Packed in tight, and jumping up
and down.  Flame me to Kingsford if you want, but the music played early
on seemed pretty one-dimensional and uninspiring.  There were two
vocal loops that I remember that made me laugh in pity.
One said (as near as I could tell) "Fuck San Francisco" and the other
"Suck My Dick".  I'm sure the DJ won over many converts to his side that night!

At 11:30 there was a DJ change (someone said Jason??) and it immediately
picked up.  Trancey, techno, the kinda music that makes you wiggle your
hands and head and feet and fanny in all sortsa fun ways.  The energy
seemed to build and build for the next hour, as people got more and
more excited.

Nearly everyone was dancing by the time Orbital came on at about 12:45.
It was obvious that nearly everyone was there to see the live performance
by the volume of the crowd.  They started with a hum, spoke a few words, and
segued into "Impact".  This really got everyone jumping up and down,
left and right, around in circles.
Nearly every song they played that evening was done in a different
arrangement than recorded on vinyl or cd, funkier, faster,
slower, fresher, it sounded _good_.  Musicians who can make live music
sound better than studio are really talented.  I think that some
of the songs were actually _shorter_ than on the album, maybe so that
they would always be playing something??

They also played Crash and Carry, Kein Trink Wasser, I Wish I Had Duck
Feet, Are we here, and several others that I don't know the names of.  The 
sound seemed incredible, and everyone around was boogieing away.  Near the
end they played Halcyon, layered on top of Crash and Carry (stunning!)
and (possibly their best song) Belfast,
and closed with a medly, to much cheering from the crowd.

When a base beat started in one song, my friend Bryan (a musician) said:
"Howdtheydothat?!"
"Idunno, you're the musician!"
"I know the component beats, it's like someone explains something and you
say 'Oh of course', but how did they come up with that?!?!"  That's the
secret, music that just hits your dance button and tickles your mind
at the same time.

Saturday night Orbital showed one possible future of electronic music.
It was an amazing performance; if you enjoy their style of music don't
miss their next show!!

The next DJ had a tough job to do.  The crowd seemed pretty worked by the
time the Hartnolls were done playing, and lots of people were sitting
down around us.  But within 15 minutes nearly everyone was dancing again
to some groovy tunes.  I wish I could describe the style of music better!

We left about 3:30; I was afraid the resident donut eater was going to
follow us out of the lot.  Fortunately we avoided harassment and made
it home in great shape.  I had some of the memorable transitions 
reverberating through my head for the next few days.

All in all, a fine weekend!

take care,
matt

Jungle seems to be sneaking up on the West Coast.  Not only were their
jungle sets at the Orbital gig, but Kinetic had what might have been the
first full jungle set in SF on Friday night, thanks to DJ Paul from Ireland.
It's hard to dance to but I'm more interested in jungle, musically, than
in fast techno, hard trance or hardcore.

c u in the future!

Um, there's nothing *wrong* with dancing to the bass line, you understand.
That's what Come/Unity was always about, in my experience.  I remember
people just going nutso bouncing up and down and all over at 1015 Folsom
at some of the previous Come/Unity when all you could really hear was
the bass line.  Although I prefer to have quite a bit of melodic stuff
in the music, I don't mind at all when everyone's going off their whatevers
to the beat.  As Tam says, "Hug your waistline to the bass line" :-)

he would mix at eye level with the decks/mixer and then jump across the

love it when dj's have so much energy....anyways, was dj dan there or

Actually, in case you didn't catch the context, someone who constantly
rags on LA for no reason except to stroke himself in public made a snide
remark about LA for some reason beknowst only to him.

If someone who had not previously started a flame war that was based on 
his lies about Richard James not being at an event when everyone
was saying he was had posted that same post, it could have been taken as a joke

BUT, IT WASNT.  It was said as an unfounded attack on a scene and a city
and people that someone knows nothing about. 
(amazingly like the post im responding to)

> From what I heard it was (yet) another LA party with a lot of bullshit
> on the flier.   This is just considered normal for down there?

I don't really know what you mean by bullshit on the flyer,
do you mean lies? or just the stuff at the event was bullshit...?

i don't have the flyer handy, although it was posted here,
with some exceptions in regards to DJ's who decided to go to Europe
it pretty much seemed like everything promised was there
even the stuff i didnt want :) :)

This was in no way shape or form a party. This was supposed to
be a full blown several thousand person rave.  
(but the location had to be changed and it had its capacity cut in half,
though there were still around 4,500 people)

If you have to ask if this is normal, or if you even think this is normal
for LA, then you really shouldnt be talking about LA, 
because you don't know a damn thing about it.
(Cuz really.. our scene is a LOT more like the BH 90210 Peach Pit After Hours)

LA is based mostly on small, pretty underground clubs,
and every once in awhile there is a big event that pops its head up,
and gathers some 5,000+ people who just get decadent and wild.

I don't know what song had the "Fuck S. F." vocal in it,
nor who made it, or where they actually come from,
so i really can't talk much about it.

I think it is sad that someone would make a song like that,
but then again, sometimes, when all you hear from people
in SF is people talking out their asses about other people's scenes,
it's not too hard to have it slip out without much thought.

And i'm not going to say LA is perfect and wonderful and 
that you should just come down and give it a chance.

Because.. well.. i _personally_ would much rather have anyone
who is going to cop some undeservedly arrogant attitude
about people they know nothing about stay as far away as possible.

Actually, most everything on the flyer was delivered, and more. (ie ambient
area, even if it was freezing) Doc Martin wasn't there, as he went to
Europe the day before, but I don't know when he made the decision to go.
All in all it was a good event, well worth $15. The multicolor lasers were
quite well done.

With any large commercial event there's a certain bullshit factor, whether
it's in LA, SF, or NY.

Listen flame-boy,

I did my time in LA and got the fuck out.
You don't know Jack about my "context" but this doesn't
seem to stop you from declaring me arrogant and clueless.
I think LA is a plastic hell town.
Deal with it.  

Not everyone has to blow sunshine up your ass.
I make a simple comment about recent big LA parties
and the misinformation on the flyers and all of a sudden
I'm reading veiled threats about staying out of "my hometown"

Waiting for raver gang warfare,
Dave

Can't we all just get along? Please?
Can't everyone be allowed to enjoy the special uniqueness 
of "his" or "her" scene without being called to 
do some kind of verification taste-test?  

As per the lyrics, couldn't we think of them as a form

Reward: to anyone who finds a gold, wide-band wedding ring with stones,
lost on 11/28/94, please call........

I SWEAR someone actually put this up all over the place here in berkeley.
Seems pretty irresponsible to lose yer WEDDING ring, but putting out an ad,
man! Bet this person couldn't keep a pet tortoise when they were a kid: "it
ran away mom, it just got away!" sheesh!(sfrave-slang for omigod!)

Uhn! Gardening club is awesome! Got a tropical island coastal forest (palms
and lianas and acers) with a plane crash over the bar, and in the plane you
can sit and look out the window into screens with TWISTED visuals, they
really look good sober....and kick ass when altered...

great music, not too loud, yet other's talking can't drown out the sound.
18+, u need ID for the bar, but what's the point....nice crowd, NO ANGRY
SAMOANS at the door(this IS behind DV8) and pay only 3 papayas to get in!
Got to meet Sea of Sin (wow!) and Handiboy&Todd were there, as well as the
techonolgically disenfranchised. Thoroughly baked, really a good way for
such a short party (ends at 3, starts at 11), and the only cops were the
ones outside in the unmarked cars. 

To end on a sweet note: the cops who serve and protect, of course, saw me
park near a meter, stayed quiet, and then ran up and ticketed me when I was
gone. At the end, I see a phat ticket for street cleaning, but lo, no sign
to tell me (and the cops wouldn't share that info either). Bastardos! I
don' need no steenkin' badges! 
The car behind me got one, and we are going to court togethar, hand in
hand, witness to each other, with photo evidence, and FU*K THE POLICE! I am
going to get my load off on this one. No way will I let him get his sneaky
wish that I will not protest a totally wrong ticket, or even a "right" one.
Friggin extortion, like mafia protection payments: u pay 25cents at the
meter, or we give you a 25$ fine....so I'm takin this meter maid with a gun
to court! And speakin' mah mind! Amen! 
Oooh, I feel so much better....

Well, i forgot the name, but pacific is puttin on sumthin this sat, is it
something with stars in the name? Anyway, guess it will be a great party
and a wonderful chance to give back sumthin to Galen and co. for such a
good summer. Gotta love that guy, he hasn't yet thrown a $15 party! Arriba!
What a wonderful november for all of us.....glad to spend it with such
wonderful people!

I Love you people!
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

Mijos, I really don't like a city with that type of spread, never felt
comfortable with the blonds in Masseratis pullin up and givin the mexboy
the keys to park it and never once acknowledging he's a human being, but
that's my impression of the place. Plus they got that lapd thingy.
nahnahnha, I don' like it.

But that's just me. I did meet Matt and Joel from LA, at Tribal Funk, the
latter had a REAL good time, he was in that patchwork dress if anyone saw
him. Really positive people, and he said that they themselves throw parties
similar to ours vibewise, so i plan to check 'em out someday. Gave him my
butterfly kaleidascope, I mean, he looked born for it, and traded it for a
whistle (which I have not the ability to play without being physically
reprimanded).

Actually, DJ Dan was in Hoboken this weekend, at the XIII Charles P.
Reittmeier Ultimate Frisbee/Bingo Invitational, and the only thing spun
there was his fluorescent "Wham-O," so I hope I've cleared things up fer
you folks.

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee......

ps. Me and Jeno are going to the Texarcana Paintball Open this weekend, and
we will display our trophy and hematomas at Come/unity.  Wish us luck!



pps. I really should watch what I write, huh?

Dj Dan WAS at Tribal Funk.  I sat there and talked to him, and 
there is a picture of him in the new screensaver, which is 
ready to release.  DROP IT.  HE WAS THERE.  The lineup: Doran, 
Darwin Chamber, Dj Dan, Tony, Donald Glaude (I left during the 
end of Donald's set).  

I would release the new version of the screen saver, but I 
can't seem to FTP to hyperreal for some reason.  If someone can 
give me an alternate location to store it, or can send it to 
hyperreal for me, let me know.  The server seems to be down.

Announcing the release of:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

THE OFFICIAL SFRAVES SCREENSAVER FOR WINDOWS v1.1:
* TRIBAL FUNK 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY *
by DJ Dave Alga
FILENAME: SFRSS11.ZIP
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Well, it was a long and tiring weekend, but we've come back 
with
the second release of the Screen Saver.  Sorry, but there is no
upgrade version for this one.  We just had too many pictures 
from
the party, so we had to re-release it.  The original one only 
can
handle 8 pictures, and we cut down from 64 to 14 pictures that 
we
had to include for you.  A lot of our good shots didn't come 
out
very good, due to the amount of fog from the fog machines in 
the
room.  The flash reflected off the fog, and blurred our shots. 
But we still managed to get in some pictures of Doran, Donald 
Glaude, Dj Dan, Tony, Carlos, Ghost, and a lot of the people 
that
made the party great.  The vibe was fantastic, especially 
during
Donald Glaude's set around 3:30-4:00am.  I met a lot of new 
people
and a few from the SFRaves list.  So, we worked our butts off 
to
bring this to you, so go grab it now!  It's available by FTP at
hyperreal.com in the directory /incoming.  I can also UUEncode 
it
to you if your mailer will accept encodes of over 1 meg.  Look 
forward to another release very soon.  I'd like to thank the 
following people for helping on this release:  Kyle, T-Dog, all
the people from Tribal Funk, all the DJ's, the girl from the
opening picture (sorry, I couldn't hear your name over the 
pumping
bass!), Donald, MDMA, and all the people who I forgot, I'll try
to get you in next time.  See you all soon...

Um, Dave, I think the comment about DJ Dan being in Hoboken was supposed
ta be a, like, *joke* designed to let everyone know it's time to chill
on this issue.  Seems to me like a very good idea.

Does anyone remember the "Moby go away" thread on ne-raves?  Sort of 
the same idea . . .

Greetings!

You may recall there was some mention of Friends and Family tapes and
availability on the list a few weeks back.  At that time, I volunteered
to take comments and summarize to the list.  Here's the summary:

I received 11 pieces of email stating interest in obtaining tapes of at
least one DJ.  6 people requested tapes of the entire evening (though it's
not clear which room, or both rooms).

High quality DATs of all the music is available; some of it has been
reviewed for quality.  it's reported to be generally high quality. the
tapes made by komotion are missing some portions of tamotsu's set, as well
as portions of ethan's, jeff's and joe's.  there is also a portion of the
komotion set which is mono, though all komotion tapes have crowd noise
mixed in.

this information will be discussed by the planners of Friends and Family
(which includes me).  We'll let those individuals who expressed an opinion
what our decison is.  If you'd like to express further opinions, please
send me some mail.

Thanks!

It seems like we shouldn't even really have all of this negative crap and I
know that by responding to it I'm probably prolonging its life... But it's hard

Hyperreal changed IP numbers last night so depending on your local 
nameservers you may have had trouble finding it, but it should be 
propagated by now. Try 204.62.130.240 if you are having trouble.
We were having problems with FTP related to TLG net problems but that 
seems to have been solved now since we're not fed through TLG anymore.

I went to Spundaes on Sunday finally, and had a complete blast for 4 and a half
hours straight of boingy boingy dancing on my part.  In fact, I had the honor
and joy of being able to bring my brother and sister along too.

The music was great, and the sound was really good (except in the back room),
and I love the space, and the crowd was really cool and nice.

However, I heard this one song, and loved it, and looked at the record, and the
song was called "Throw Your Guns" (If I remember correctly), and it was a remix
by Dramaboy.  However, I didn't see who the original artist was.  Does anyone
know this record?  I totally loved it, and want to add it to my meager
collection of good vinyl hopefully.  Any comments would be well appreciated,
and any related or like artist recommendations would be welcome too.

Hey, that Beverly Hills 90210 Peach Pit After Hours Rave was KILLER!  I mean
think about it: a totally cool space (a diner), cool people (Dylan, Brandon,
Kelly, and that new girl who likes to smoke weed in Brenda's old bedroom -
who could ask for better friends?), great music (2 Unlimited, Real McCoy,
Madonna, and Traci Lords), I even heard that Doc Martin was spinning!  So
don't be making fun of 90210, because unlike other TV shows, this one ISN'T
fake.  I know it isn't, because I saw the hospital report when Dylan was
admitted for his drug problem.  IT'S REAL MAN!  (unfortunately, this post is
not though...  :)

I'm not a native, but I would like to think that a state of
higher consciousness attracted me to the left coast.  When I first got here
I wasn't too keen on the idea of heading out into Ominous Downtown LA late,
late in the night...but my inhibitions have slowly diminished.  My best
friends frequent SF and regularly do the LA thing.  Yes, both cities have
special attributes that distinguish them from one another, but I think what
is most important in any city is for different types of people to get along
and share new things together...it is this group-think attitude that
separates humankind and does not allow us to recognize similarities which
can provide the foundation for a new relationship.  I used to think that it
would be nice to bring together a nice medley of nationwide DJ's, but I
dunno...  Do you think, I would be excommunicated if I tried to visit
SF?...hey, I was that disenchanted when I first came to LA!  How Weird!
Anyway, Orbital was a live act, and we all should be able to recognize
problems created by mass marketing efforts, and ticket outlets like
ticketmaster.  Joe Rice commented on the typical BS asssociated with an
event of such grandure, right-on, I did'nt expect any less!  Look what has
happened to the once unique Lollapallooza Fest.  I ask that you all
remember one thing, even if you do decide to keep bickering back and
forth...  No matter any of your personal preferences to-date, music,
cities, dj's, fashion, any of those things that make up your current values
and/or beliefs, I believe that we all stem from the same roots.  Remember
how far things have come, they will never be the like they used to, but
we've got to try and make the best of what we still have.  Now go to your
rooms!  =)

Positive!  -M

Being a newbie from Ohio, bear with me.

I just was wondering what the big difference was between raves (or 
parties) in Sf and LA? I know that there's a rather large difference 
between SF and Cleveland raves (when we were lucky enough to have 
them...) in the vibe and hype surrounding them, but judging from the 
posts I've read (I haven't been to any raves in LA and only a couple 
here), there isn't much difference between them.

I know exactly what your talking about.  Thew record you saw is in my 
opinion one of the absolute best trax I have ever heard in my entire 
fuckin' life!!!  The song is called "phoenix" and is by Godwithin aka 
Hardkiss.  It comes in a whitelabel double pack with 4 versions of it.  
The Hardkiss bros. totally ripped of the guitar sample from some other 
song so they had to quit printing it.  I've heard that only like 500 
copies were ever made!  I'ts relatively new so some record stores might 
still have a copy or 2.  DEFINITELY get this record.

That's using the old IP number (140.174.72.240).

Yup, that's using the new IP number.  The "sl-uofguam-4.sprintlink.net" 
is hilarious - it's an old name for the same IP number as a new router.
40ms is pretty good if you ask me.

The reverse-DNS wasn't done until a little later, but that should be fine 
now too.

from my point of view the chill room at tribal funk was mind blowing
not because of what we did but because of the crowd. It was incredible to 
watch, my mixing sufferred as a result, people were having sex!!
humping frigging licking friends helping and yes someone puked on my records!
At one point I witnessed a 100 person group hug It did not matter what we 
played the crowd was unstoppably sexy  ( until the lights came on, then 
we didnt look to good..)

what a load of crap... If this is a rave, then the Deadkirks "Let's Make
Some Fuckin' Noise" is a good song :->

But hey, it's on the web, courtesy of a test run of EIT's HTML authoring
environment and SGI Indy S-VHS video input... Sorry about the not so
wonderful picture quality -- Channel 2 doesn't come in well on my
cable kludge....
