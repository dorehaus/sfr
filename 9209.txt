What this has to do with raves I'll never know, but, since you asked...

Lisa suckdog sucks. She's a waste of water and neurotransmitters.
Basically, a wanna-be Karen Finley with less (no) talent.

Here's a lamo review I wrote back in '89... followed by some other equally
lame reviews culled from nm-list:

| Not half as lame as the following:
| 
| During the kitty litter piss "scene", they were heading towards the
| audience with the kitty litter box a-sloshin. Now, piss I love, but my
| girlfriend don't so I pulled her out of the way just in the nick-o-time as
| the piss-litter combo splooged on the chair where she had been sitting.
| Then we retreated to areas safe from urine and defecation.... a minute
| later, when I was thinking about how to get the fuck out of that place, she
| comes a runnin' into me all nekkid piss-coverd and airything totin' this
| little box that said "car." SHe said she saw me running away and was there
| to run me over (got it? "car" "run over") as she slammed me into the wall.
| 
| Later, when it ended, I was the first at the door, which was locked and
| unopenable.... she saw us at the door and started screaming at us not to
| leave... we finally got the door open and she nearly followed us nekkid
| into the streets. I was kinda hoping for the latter but she hadn't drunk
| enough beer.
| 
| Suckdog's future -- She should take her show on the road and appear at
| college fraternity initiation rites....
| 
| All in all, it was an experience nearing the levels of fun found in
| masturbating with a Hoover Vibrabeat vacuum cleaner. I probably shoulda
| spent the night in Noe valley watching "The Last Temptation of Christ"
| while stitching my scrotum around my pet hamster's neck with barbed wire.
| 
| But then again, it had been a really bad day so maybe i was just in a bad
| mood.

Subject: sfraves rave 

 
I think Eric's idea is great.  Have a rave for sfravers.  I don't even think 
we should try to attract the "crowd".  We've already got the sfravers on the 
list and their friends....when 1015 Folsom basement gets hot temperature wise, 
it gets HOT and HUMID and not too many people can fit in there anyway.  I get
uncomfortable when there's more than say about 150 people in there.   I love
that room,  I used to think that Velvet Lounge was one of the best kept secrets
of SF until nobody started showing up.  It's running into problems because of
the low attendance rate (about 10 people) but when it was going well (about 10 
months ago) it was a great place.  By the way, the Velvet Lounge is 
still sometimes going on Wednesday nights if it's not too empty to shut down 
but it might be held on the ground floor now :-(

As for the day, I think Friday is fine.  We don't have to worry about 
competing raves cause we could cater to a crowd with a certain type of rave 
mentality in mind.  I don't think name djs are important because it's not the 
dj's names that matter but the music they play.  And if you're not interested 
in drawing a "crowd" then name djs don't even matter as long as the music is
good.  I'm personally yearning for a low-key, relaxing, mellow, high-energy (I 
think things can be mellow and high-energy simultaneously), low-cost, highly
friendly rave populated with people who are into having a good time and into 
meeting new people.  Of course, the sentences above are just my pipe dreams 
and I'm just missing what I caught the tail end of and what I think it must 
have been like in the old times.  Like a rave filled with super friendly people
who you can hold a conversation with despite the fact that they are total 
strangers.  Where everybody flashes you a genuine smile evEn though they don't
know you.  Where you don't have to find a reason to start talking to the 
person standing next to you YET a place where you could enjoy yourself alone
if that's what you wanted.  A place filled with people who decided before
they left their houses that night that they were gonna have a good time and yet
kept their expectations to a minimum.  A place where you could feel the 
positive energy going on between people as soon as you entered.
Whoa, I'm having dreams...............................................

PS.  ComeUnity was great last night even though the music was too low-energy 
  for my tastes - it made people dance in slow motion a lot.

My idea of a cool party is lots of great music, attractive women, and
lots of alcoholic beverages.  Is this what a rave is like?

What kind of music exactly is "techno?"  Interesting.  We're not talking
Paula Abdul here, are we?

I love the Cure, for one, and Jesus & Mary Chain, Jane's Addiction,
NIN, stuff like that -- is there alternative music at these things?

Down with MC Hammer-style stuff.  I heard enough of that in my teen years

I think we should find out where/when it is, and if it looks cool, get as many
people from the list to show up as we can.  There's  no sense in wasting
free publicity.  But if it's a big time thing trying to sell itself by showing
off a false list of promoters, it will probably a) suck and b) get shut down.

Subject: sfraves at the park


I just got off the phone with Martin O'Brien, the organizer of the event that
we've been listed as helping to promote.  There's no need to fear.  Here's da
scoop:

Martin is one of the organizers of the Gathering and Basics.  He was having a
conversation with someone on the list about sfraves (I won't identify that
person unless they want to come forward), and then told this person about 
what he was throwing.  Martin asked this person if he would be interested in
helping out; and by a series of missed connections thought he was asking if
sfraves would be interested in helping.  So, he thought that "yes" meant the
unidentified person was speaking for the whole group of us. 

What it is: it'll be Saturday, Sept. 12th, in GG Park, noon until 7pm, 
the usual great DJ's (Josh Garth Tony Jeno Spun + more), with the $5
attendance going towards paying for the site (the bandshell) and charity. 
(They haven't decided the charity yet, but they will soon).  Included 
in this operation are what Martin termed "the good promoters" - Hardkiss
productions, the Housing Project, Come/Unity, Full Moon Massive, etc.
(there was a list of about 10, all of clubs that got good reviews on the
list, and in whose company I have _no_ problem being).  One of the main
purposes of the event is to educate the public about raves, about how
it's not just 2000 drug-crazed kids moving their asses to mindless music.
There will be reporters there, etc.

So where do we come into play?  Well, Martin is asking each of the promoters
to help by fronting it with $50 - that's to pay for all the deposit and permit
stuff and insurance for the event that we know oh so well.  He said we would
get that back, so I'll go ahead and use some of the money I've gotten back
from people for Connection.  He also needs people to help in collecting money
at the event, and I told him I'm pretty sure we could get a small gaggle of
people to go.

So, I rest assured that our name will not be tarnished by this; in fact, I
do consider it an honor to be associated with them.  And I think we can
all help by going to this too, and showing that smart people go to raves too.
:):):):)

I'm about halfway through with compiling the surveys... sorry about the delays.

Also, we are set for the 25th at 1015 Folsom.  I'll get back to the DJ's to
let them know...

 The use of "sfraves" by an unknown group is quite alarming to me. Although 
some folks have said that it might turn out to be free advertising for
sfraves, the very way in which our name has been exploited, without the
permission or consultaion with anyone in sfraves, can only mean that these
folks have the same high moral standards as the folks who ripped off Brian's
laser and Neils' backpack at CONNECTION.

 I can't tell anyone else in sfraves what to do, nor am I trying to , but my 
feelings are urging me to pull some serious pranks on these guys, or maybe
even picketting the rave! Even if the rave itself is of good quality, if
they "get away with it", anybody and everybody else will be sticking the 
"sfraves" name on flyers for all kinds of garbage pseudo-raves.

Lunch will again be happening, in Berkeley, this Friday, at my spacious

have soda and OJ (but bring everything else).

Location: Clark Kerr Campus, Building 17, suite 103

Directions:  Take Dwight east from College
	     Make a right at Warring
	     Pass one stop sign
	     Turn in the next driveway on the left (it's a bi-level parking
		lot - park towards the upper end, to the back)
	     Walk up the ramp between the big L-shaped building on the left,
		(bldg. 12) and the smaller L-shaped builing on the right
		(bldg. 16). 
	     The building you will be facing is 17 - walk up the path to the

Last week there were about 7 people there, and it was terrific fun.  Sound

	I do take it as a compliment that we were mentioned on the flyer...
but we did work hard to put Connection on, and I've worked hard to make sure
the sfraves name has a good image (which I think we've succeeded in doing).
At this point I want information - to what extent are we listed on the flyer
(are we co-promoting it, or are the rave organizers just name-dropping?) and
how legit is the operation (is it the Feel-X promoters, for example, or is
it a Full Moon Massive operation?)  I'm somewhat.. er.. stupified that our
name is on it and the list was never made aware of it, but now that we're on
I think it's in our interest to support it, make sure it's a legitimite
operation, that if they are raising money for charity it truely is going to
a real charity, and that we can have a small part in helping to put it on.
I just don't want it to bomb and have our name attached to something we had
no part in, or that if we allow this other promoters will start including our
name on other events that aren't legit....

One thing that Randy suggested to me was the Renaissance Pleasure
Fair grounds - I can't even find an ad for them in the Sunday Chronicle, so
if anyone could get more info on this I'd appreciate it.


-----I worked at thee Renaissance Faire for five years till about 1982.  They
are generally strapped for cash and on the brink of chpt. 11 so they would
probably charge alot for their facilities.  Also the place is a dust bowl.
When the Faire is on they run water trucks through the place all night long
soaking the grounds with water (laced with fire retardent) to hold the dust
down in the day.  Up the hill in the back of the Faire is actually a residential
area that complains if noise gets to bad.  I think some sound baffles may have
been installed in the woods on the hill at one time.  I saw an ad in the Sunday
Chronicle about the Faire being open the morning of the Cyborganic Be-In.  Labor
day weekend was usually a big weekend for them.  They do have lotsss of parking
and their property is like their own little country.  They do have their own
security people they may insist on being employed.  Let's go to the Renaissance
Faire this weekend!?

Also, I have been silent on this issue because I wanted to hear what others
would say about it, but I am all in favor of having (and helping organize)
an event at Eric Lacy's club once a month or more.

Not true!

If you want an FBI file of your very own, request your file from them
under the Freedom of Information Act.  Your request must include your
place and date of birth, Social Security number, complete legal name,
and a notarized signature.  Send all this to

	Federal Bureau of Investigation
	Freedom of Information Unit
	J. Edgar Hoover Building
	10th St. and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
	Washington, DC 20535

If you have a file they'll send you return mail telling you how long it
is; to actually get a copy there's a fee of ten cents per 100 pages.

True.  Painfully and sickeningly true.  The FBI routinely
lies on FOIA requests.  Countless people have filed FOIA
requests, been told the bureau had no file on them, and later
found out they did.  Read up on the CISPES surveillance for
evidence of this.  I was being photographed by FBI agents in
my teens yet my own FOIA request came back blank.

Does this have rave relevance?  Yes.  The FBI inflitrated the whole 60's
era acid test/rock concert/happenings movement solely for the
purpose of checking up on non-normative cultural changes.
This was quite apart from all the political hubbub (something
like 1 in 10 SDS members was an FBI agent or informer).
People who never went near a war protest yet hung with the
Pranksters one weekend ended up with FBI files.  It could
easily happen that you'd go to a rave, get pointed out as a
well-known raver, and end up with your license plate
photographed.  In a couple of days there'll be a spanking new
file on you in the Hoover Building containing everthing from
your elementary school grades to your latest utility bills.

This is not hare-brained paranoia.  You've got to realize that
this is routine for them and although nefarious doesn't
necessarily mean you'll come to grief over it.  As was noted,
you can be a total crazy and still get a security clearance.
Just don't assume they don't have a file on you.

Did anyone else out there listen to the message on the Be At Line

of all of the listings, and this particular one was supposedly
from the SFPD who said (not a direct quote) "To all ravers out
there, the SFPD has determined that it is now time to STOP all raves
because they think raves should be stopped....blah blah blah..."
Is this some sort of joje? The message was on Saturday night.

Subject: Re:  Our own private gatherings - call for DJ's!

I think we have a real chance to influence the "scene" here - you guys
have probably noticed that there are more raves than ever now, usually
several every weekend night, but it seems like fewer that we like to
go to...  Lately, raves have been more expensive, with worse crowds, 
permit/fire/police problems, etc etc.  If we offer a low-cost, 
non-profit, low-profile (publicity-wise) alternative, we can keep the
scene alive and maybe keep some of the other promoters from going
further out of control.  The full moon, mission rock, come/unity 
and others already help with this; we can join them and make sure
alternatives always exist for the $20 busts we've been seeing lately.

See you all at Come/Unity!

I agree with Jonathan's comments; though I think that some of the postings
may be unintentional ("R" replies only to the original poster, while "r"
replies to the original poster and everyone else).  Again I don't want
to have a "chilling" effect, but a flood of "me too" messages can be
a bit overwhelming, both for people on the list and for poor old Soda.

I have been toying with this idea... now that it looks like the people on
sfraves will be putting an event on with some amount of regularity (i.e.,
the "Alternity" once a month and maybe Connection once every three months)
I was thinking of asking my sysadmin if we could create a side-list, called
sfraves-planners, which would have people on it who are genuinely interested
in helping put these events on and want to know about up-to-the-minute
minutae of the event planning process.  Certainly Connection can be blamed
for squelching discussion of some other topics during the timeframe it was
up, topics like reviews of weekend events, why certain raves were busted,
debates about the merits of velcro walls, etc.  The idea is that anybody can
be on the sfraves-planners list, and that would by necessity be somewhat
chatty; the general sfraves list would be preserved for broader discussions.
Myself or someone on the sfraves-planners list can post to the general list
once or twice a week to let the sfravers know about what's being planned,
but they can avoid the "yes I can get firewood" or "does anyone have a 
pickup truck".  

What do people think about this?  (a private e-mail yea or nea will do)

Also, about getting a fictitious business statement - wouldn't copyrighting
the name be sufficient?  I know that can't be too much $$

Yup, it's _exactly_ what I have!  k00l!  I just love that siren-whistle

I know what you mean about this summer - I've felt that way all summer.  But
I don't think this summer will be the last.  Sure, everyone moans about the
deterioration of the scene, and all that, but I think the scene is fine.  I
mean, look what we just pulled off - Connection!  and now we're making plans
for a semi-regular event in a club space.  This scene is _not_ gonna live
_or_ die because of what the big commercial promoters do.  That could get
more popular, or vanish.  But it won't matter.  This thing runs on it's own
mojo, and it is exactly the small, cool parties planned by the ravers
ourselves that are gonna keep this alive and thriving.  And that's the small
view!  The big view is that this could be a paradigm shift of the kind that
happened when rock took over.  It's about time... all these 60 year old guys
with guitars, it's ridiculous.  Raving is a totally new way to go out and
have fun [actually it is also a very old way...] and this could be the thing
that sets rock on it's ear.  Why not?  I think we're due for a change.

see you in the future...

I went to this last week and had a really good time.  It's a gay club but the
atmosphere was not completely overwhelmed by leather and big sweaty pumping 
chests.  The music was good, very danceable not too hard.  And the most 
completely outrageous porno videos I've ever scene in my life on the wall.... 
I went to Fusion afterwards and found myself liking the more closeknit feeling
at Maneuvers better.


Also, I don't get the sfraves discussion (company policy) so I don't know if 
This has been discussed, but another weekly called Unleash The Queen started
two weekends ago.  Needless to say this is a gay event as well.  On Fridays
I believe, upstairs from DV8 -- 540 Howard St.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

the risk, of course, is not getting enough people for it to break even, or

I'm submitting the following article to a local rag  that covers the 'rave
scene'.  The magazine seems to be youth focused, and this article assumes 
that our current educational system has given the reader little or no
background in modern science.

I welcome any feedback or discussion, but if its going to be posted here,
let's try to keep it rave-related, otherwise use email.  I apologize if
this isn't deemed as pertinent to the mailing list as concerns over the
use of the sfraves name and logo seem to be.

        Raving At The Center Of The Universe - by Lee Fogel
 
                In the best of all possible worlds nothing is impossible.
                                                                The Shamen
 

Trance dancing, nootropic ingestion, audiovisual stimulation, and other
aspects of the Rave Experience have been said to promote a kind of shared
spirituality where degrees of universal connectedness between like-minded
people can be experienced.  But does this empathetic mysticism have any
basis in 'fact'?  Or is the brush with Cosmic Consciousness nothing more
than a combination of subjective feelings colored by religious precondi-
tioning, wishful thinking, and the artificial stimulation of certain parts
of the central nervous system?  As it turns out, we happen to be living in
an exciting time of informational enlightenment and it is now possible to
seek objective answers to the philosophical and metaphysical questions
about the nature of consciousness and reality by looking toward the fore-
fronts of modern science.

Let's flashback to the classic image of an electron circling around the 
nucleus of an atom.  The question of the day, circa 1925 or so, was "What
keeps the electron from falling out of orbit and collapsing into the
nucleus?"  No one knew why, but in defiance of classical Newtonian physics,
electrons seemed willing to spin in stable orbits forever.  But the truth
of the matter was that scientists couldn't directly see what electrons
were doing.  This is true of anything we try to observe: it's not a friend
you see dancing in front of you, just the light reflecting off of your
friend's body.  Likewise, in order to see (or measure) an electron, you
have to do something like bounce some light off of it.  But doing so alters
the characteristics of the electron on a way that cannot be completely
predicted.  The inability to completely measure the state of an electron
(or anything) is spelled out by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  Scien-
tists realized that the best they could do was to describe where an electron 
_probably_ was at any given time.  Probability or wave equations (developed
by Erwin Schroedinger) showed that it was highly probable that an electron
would remain in some orbit around the atom's nucleu.  In other words, the 
reason an electron doesn't fall into the nucleus is because its wave equation
makes it highly improbable.  This was the beginning of Quantum Phisics.
 
The equations of Quantum physics predicted all kinds of strange paradoxical,
yet accurate, things about nature.  It turns out that all things, even
humans, have a degree of uncertainty about them and an associated wave
equation to describe their state in the spacetime continuim.  Scientifically
speaking, you cannot know for sure where you are right now, only where you
probably are!  And there is a distinct possibility that all your atoms
(i.e. you) may in the next moment be 20 feet above your current position.
Highly improbable, but not impossible!
 
But what is really amazing about Quantum Physics is not how good it is at
explaining to scientists what's going on, but how it brings human conscious-
ness back into the picture.  Remember, the mathematics behind Quantum Physics
comes from the uncertainty involved in trying to exactly measure things.  So
it turns out that Quantum Physics and the universe as we know it would not
exist if we weren't trying to observe the universe in the first place.  Even
if we were able to exactly observe (measure) things, it couldn't be the
same universe as the one we are currently in.  According to modern science,
the structure of our universe has been molded from our attempts to know it,
and by the limits to which we are able to know it.
 
More recently, scientists like Stephen Hawking have been applying the
Uncertainty Principle and probability wave equations to the Universe as a
whole.  In trying to explain what things were like at the beginning of the
Big Bang, it has become apparent that each of us is living in one of an
infinite number of possible universes.  The scientific community is now
coming around to the realization that each of us is the creator of our own
universe in that each of us is its central observer, and yet, all of our
universes ae a part of a universal wave equation that allows for an infinite
number of possible universes.  I think that there are times during raving
that we sense this connectiveness, where we feel this oneness between our
universe and the universes of other ravers and of the atoms and galaxies
around us.  Ultimately, we are all a part of the same equation, an equation
that allows for unlimited possibilities.  Scientific awareness can be
spiritual just like the hardest techno music can be emotionally moving.  The
next time you feel like God on the dance floor, remember that not only does
science support you, but you don't even have to be certain about it!

As was pointed out by somebody else, the space for Alternity is small
enough that 150-200 will fill it to bursting ... I guess the question
is how many would be likely to show up if it wasn't promoted -- what with
sfravers and friends, would we be up at that level already?  [No, I'm not
claustrophobic, but for me there's nothing worse than an overfilled inside
space -- except possibly an overfilled inside space with great music where
there's not even enough room to enjoy myself!]

My inclination would be to try it at least once without promoting it
"outside" ... I know, I know, easy for me to say, I'm not taking any
financial risks :-)

I totally agree with Robert, we should keep it word of mouth.
All the people in the list and their friends will be enough to cover
the expences. 
We just need to tell DJ's, promoters and hardcore ravers that we can trust,
that Alternity is organized by SFRaves/Connection.

As always (:-) I take the middle ground -- I think we should do more than
just word of mouth, but less than an all-out marketing/hype campaign.

The low-key flyers that BrianB made for Connection worked fine; passing out
these flyers to "regulars" at come/unity and full-moon events is the right
level of distribution. This is basically word of mouth, except that there's
a little piece of paper serving as a reminder of a potentially forgottEn
conversation.

PLAN: Next time each of us goes out raving, bring along 10-20 of these
flyers and pass them out to people that we'd lie to see at "our" party.

Lets come up with a plain text format flyer that we can all print out (even
on stupid non-postscript printers). My postscript printer couldn't handle
the encapsulated postscript flyer BrianB made available last time. (and no
crucifixes or swastikas please!)

IMPLEMENTATION:
	(1) We need a 40 col. x 22 line chunk-o-text (w/ borders)
	describing the rave. Replicate that side-by-side twice, and
	top-to-bottom three times to get a 80 col x 66 line page that can
	be sent to any standard printer. Mail this "page" out to the list.

	(2) Each of us print out 4 copies, cut them up into six pieces on a
	paper-cutter, and you've got 24 flyers.

	(3) Make the music be better than it was at the last Come/Unity
	(It was fun, but not as much fun as the ones I attended in May,
	June, and July.)

It's funny the way people perceive things.
Another one of my friends who is NOT into computers at all
(he's a massage therapist ) Told me that some folks
were talking about Connection and how great a party it was
and were wondering who sfraves actually were, well I guess someone
sorta tried to explain this concept of an e-mail list and the Net and all
anyway the Image that my friend (and apparently alot of other ravers have come up with) Is that we are like a benevolent BORG ! They perceive us as being
sorta compu-raver cyborgs that have a group mind.  Wild.

Subject: yr flyer is open & posting in general


I'd just like to weigh in *against* the use of 'sfraves' as an
endorser or co-producer, vendor, DJ, shaman, muscian, therapist,
or anything else on anybody's flier for anything.  Next thing you know, we'll 
have a board of directors to vote on political endorsements!  Up
till now, I didn't think I was in a membership organization here.
The list has functioned very well as an open forum and while unanimity
is impossible, consensus around Connection and Alternity (good name),
makes me see those 2 events as "legitimate" uses of the sfraves name.
Having our name attached to anything other than activities produced
and supported by a largish number of us contradicts the spirit of 
cooperation and creative anarchy which has grown so well here.

I'm glad the event in question is legit and the use of our name is the
result of a well-intentioned mistake.

And I think people should continue to post to the list about events
(political, cultural, even -choke- religious) that they think might
be of interest.  I was glad hear about Club Uranus.
Oh, and as long as I'm up.. I don't like crucifixes, even inside 
squashed ovals.  But, on the other hand, I really don't care if *you* do.

When I say "promoting Alternity" I don't mean 100,000 flyers and
commercials of WILD 107 and LIVE105. I mean a few small low budget
flyers like we did for CONNECTION and like the Come/Unity people do.
Just give them out at the Park, the FMR, ComeUnity and to friends.

I think we did just fine with Connection.
People on the scene know about sfraves now and we will most
definitely get more people the next time.

Hatching successful raves are like making babies, you can't rush the process.

But we don't need to be clandestine either.  Most of the GoonTown crowd
will not want to come at 2am and not be able to drink, so I don't
think we have to worry about them.  And if some of them do show up, we
should welcome them and show them what _real raving_ is all about.

As always (:-) I take the middle ground -- I think we should do more than
just word of mouth, but less than an all-out marketing/hype campaign.

The low-key flyers that BrianB made for Connection worked fine; passing out
these flyers to "regulars" at come/unity and full-moon events is the right
level of distribution. This is basically word of mouth, except that there's
a little piece of paper serving as a reminder of a potentially forgottEn
conversation.

PLAN: Next time each of us goes out raving, bring along 10-20 of these
flyers and pass them out to people that we'd lie to see at "our" party.

Lets come up with a plain text format flyer that we can all print out (even
on stupid non-postscript printers). My postscript printer couldn't handle
the encapsulated postscript flyer BrianB made available last time. (and no
crucifixes or swastikas please!)

IMPLEMENTATION:
	(1) We need a 40 col. x 22 line chunk-o-text (w/ borders)
	describing the rave. Replicate that side-by-side twice, and
	top-to-bottom three times to get a 80 col x 66 line page that can
	be sent to any standard printer. Mail this "page" out to the list.

	(2) Each of us print out 4 copies, cut them up into six pieces on a
	paper-cutter, and you've got 24 flyers.

	(3) Make the music be better than it was at the last Come/Unity
	(It was fun, but not as much fun as the ones I attended in May,
	June, and July.)

Subject: More than the use of the sfraves name...

Howdy all.

As I perused the messages from last week, just imagine my mortification
in coming across the discussion of how the sfraves name made it onto a flyer
without the consensus of the list.  Imagine further my mortification
as the realization struck that I could have been the leak.  I don't know if
it's true, but I promise I'll be checking.

I work closely with Martin on the promotion of the Gathering and Basics
raves; during one of our many conversations he brought up the subject
of the charity rave on the 12th.  It is possible that my personal support
of this event and discussions about sfraves (which he has shown considerable
curiosity about in several of our discussions) may have gotten mixed.

Please note, for the sake of my impending electronic lynching, that
I would NEVER have given or implied the support of this group without
consensus, much less notification, nor would I have even mentioned the
POSSIBILITY of using the name sfraves without major discussion.

I agree that no one person or minority group from the list should ever
feel justified in using our name (this, one would *hope, would go
without needing to be said) no matter how noble the cause.

Whew.  With that off my chest, please put down yer phasers, call back
your viruses headed toward my account, and let's all hope that this
event will be as positive of an event as it threatens to be.

Read on ????

Agreed here.  Let's keep this as what it is, a virtual meeting place
for like minded individuals, an arena for the exchange of ideas.  Why
lower ourselves to be perceived as a producer, promoter, or any other
exclusive element of this changing scene, although those functions can
be included in what we do.

On a farther reaching scale (am I reaching?)....
We have something fairly unique in that we can help further this whole
thing, as well as help each other in finding a path through the increasing
complexity of the scene.  It's not easy now to just drop in on a random
event and find like minded people; our constant discussion will help
raise the odds of us having good experiences, and meanwhile more "energy"
will be freed to help guide outsiders in.

I absolutely agree. In fact, I think that this is the current problem. I
prefer anarchy and completely open exchange too. I think the list has grown
too big for total anarchy. There are simply too many ideas of "what the
list should be" floating around. Intimacy is predicated on communication.
Communication is impossible in a Tower of Babel situation.

As with any community, unless we can agree on some basic norms of behavior,
we are destined to self-destruct.

But I think at least MOST of us can agree. Those who can't will vote with
their (electronic) feet. I hope I'm not one of 'em!

	 I'm not sure that it is a good idea to flyer for Alternity.
        Connection was on a week night, and over an hour from San Francisco,
        yet it was a huge success with little flyering by unknown "promoters."
        Now that people are starting to hear about sfraves our draw could be
        even stronger.  Add to this the fact that Alternity will be on a
        Fri. night/Sat. morning, and that it will be in San Francisco, plus
        it will occur in a small space.  I'm not sure how large the list is
        now but I think it has been growing at a significant rate.
        I think that Alternity would be more than adequateley advertised by
        word of mouth.

	The date is set, Friday, September 25th (actually Saturday morning,
for those who keep track), 2am-8am.  Like I think was said originally,
(but I'm reiterating), f the first one goes well (which I think it will)
we'll have it once a month in the same space.  What we do with that space,
of course, is open for discussion... I'd like to see it be used for more
than a simple DJ-and-strobe experience. :)

	There is only one room, and I'll need a few people to bring fans to
keep the space down there at a tolerable temperature.  All our security and
sound system requirements are taken care of by the club, so really all that's
left up to us is providing DJ's, smart drinks (courtesy of Chris Beaumont),
and visuals.  Black lights will be there, but I thought I'd also bring my
color-cycling fractal-generating computer too (a most _wonderful_ trip toy)
and maybe someone could bring a projection something.  We don't have too
have a whole lot of production on this - there basically isn't a whole 
lot of room for a bunch of production anyways. :)

	I won't be coming up with any flyers or anything, but I will be putting
it on the phone machine (1-415-267-4889).  I've decided not to keep the 510
number as it would cost $18 a month while the 415's only $10 or so.  I think
we can pack the place with no flyers - just tell your friends the date, the
place, that people from the list will be DJ'ing, and we'll be set. :)

 A dusty VISION, but not as dusty as last time, by some people's accounts.
I've still got some of that warehouse dust in my nose - ACHOO!

 Last night's VISION rave by The Gathering folks was held at an enormous
warehouse in Livermore. $20 to get in. Tons of people - maybe 2000 ? Sound
system OK - my opinion is that the bass could have been cleaner. Being an 
enclosed space, the sound really carries to all corners without too much
loss of volume. The music itself was great, and the mood of the crowd was
the best! 

 If anything, my only complaint about the crowd was the amount of walking
around that people were doing - it made it hard to get into a "trance dance"
mode if you have to make way for another group of people to get by. On the
other hand, I was doing a lot of roaming around too, so 'mea culpa'.

 If you didn't meet me there - I was wearing a big checked shirt with the
Disney character Goofy on the front. The folks I saw there were Chris 
Beaumont, Neils, the "SFR logo T-shirt guy", Geoff, the Normals and their 
guests from Conneticut, "the guy I met at Greer Park", and our Fearless 
( conga line ) Leader Brian. 

 Bottles of spring water for $1.00 each was the cheapest liquid refreshment
until about 3 AM, when they ran out of bottles to sell, so they put out
some free water for the rest of the night. Lots of decorative banners,
and video/visual displays . 

 Some police presence in the parking lot, but the facility seemed to have 
its own security and staff. 


 The next one I'm going to is I MAGI NATION at 177 Townsend (?) this Thurs.
Looking at the flyer, I wonder how they can fit all that stuff in there?
Oh well - I'll have Friday off, so I'll be able to stay all night to find
out!

Sunday evening.  Completely dosed, Mitch leans over and  in heavy panting
breaths says to me "Pete, you know what after awile it's all the same,
the music, the people, everything"  After this seemingly epiphany moment
he breaks  out  his whistle starts blaring away muttering "If you can't
beat the system,  go with the flo." God knows wence that came.  Yet at
some raves they flood you with an overpowering release of bass, and yes,
you loose that intangible midrange, that  illusive middle spot where you're
between heaven and hell, or at least two sweat laden bodies,  and you
are swept into the essence of the music.  Anyhow, overall. Decent rave.
We should get together  an Sfraves field trip on of these days. Rent
a whatever and trek down south or better yet, fly the old red eye  to the
UK.  I'm  not sure what airfare is these days, but  England would  just be
it.  Not only that,  we  can rave the old  baggy scene a bit, feel
thoroughly english and hip as we sway are ravE asses to Ned's or Flowered
Up and later hit one of those vast raves that hit out in Scotland somewhere.
Farfectched, perhaps.  But  I see a field trip happening someday.

Well I'm not sure how much I'd like to see sfraves tied into SF Net. I tried
it for a while and found some of the the discourse fairly juvenile, some but not
all. There are some kids on Haight using the terminals who bring the same
mindset as when playing BattleZone. The terminals are totally public and thus
anyone with a quarter can access, which I like, but I'm not sure it would be
in sfraves best interest if the contents of our postings could be quickly
transmitted to anyone hanging out in the Haight.

One can start a totally anonymous account on SF Net by just walking into a cafe 
with some quarters, there would be no knowing who someone was. We had a fairly 
long discussion on security a while back, and if you allowed accounts from 
SF Net, anyone could read our mail and we would never know who that person
really was. At least now there is some correlation between a login on

Wrong day, pal!  It's happening next Saturday, the 12th.  Sorry you made
a wasted trip.

The charities haven't been chosen yet.  Supposedly a committee of the
co-sponsors will make a joint decision, but as best as I can determine
it's in the hands of Gavin Hardkiss (Alpha Communications) and Martin
(Basics / Gathering).  Theoretically Brian and/or I should have a role in
the selection process, given the use of our name...

Gavin tells me that the money will be split among any worthwhile cause that
proposes to get a share.  On the other hand, the permit fees have become so
exorbitant (something like $600) they are going to need a lot of ravers
emptying their pockets before they have a surplus to hand out.

So bring a lot of your friends, especially ones with disposable incomes.
And if you have any good ideas for recipients, drop me some e-mail!

Subject:  A dusty VISION

Cough! Cough!  I was still sneezing dust particles this morning, I think
I also have 'black lung' symptoms. :)  You'd think for $20 a person the
Vision promoters would rent a vacuum-truck and clean up the dirt a bit?

I arrived at Vision at 1:30AM, the first quarter of the moon was setting.
There were several groups of 'beer drinkers', and other partiers I
passed in the parking lot on the way to the gate.  I was walking near
a concrete loading dock when a bottle smashed on the dock just 15 feet
from where I was walking!!  "Nah!  It wasn't thrown at me????", I thought,
couldn't see where it came from, my pace to the gate quickened!

Once inside I found Josh, mixing down a great set.  Jeno next, then
Garth "brought us gently back to Earth" with a super techno mix.
(Was there another DJ in there somewhere?)
It was interesting to watch Garth dancing during and before he was
DJing.  Jeno & Garth are my favorite DJ's, but then I grew up in
ToonTown. :)

I had an experience with the red bright scanning laser that they 
had there.  With light smoke from a 'smoke machine' you could
put your hands up into the beam and see unusual shadows and things.
At times it would scan low and surround you and make you feel like
you were "in the beam".  I thought the sound system was just fine,
not 'ear damaging loud' as some raves I've recently been to.
I didn't wear earplugs all night.

Wanted to keep dancing all morning when the organizers opened
one of the large garage doors to let in the Sunday morning sunrise...
and Garth faded it out. :(  The security soon 'shooed' us out of that
gigantic warehouse.

So yes I had a very good time at Vision.  The only thing that it did lack
was a Ambient Room, a clean place with pillows where you could go to
'chill out' or lay down or whatever.  All in all I was really impressed
by the event, dusty butt and all.

Subject: Re:  A dusty VISION


	I thought Vision was great, too:  but besides the dust I had one other
major complaint.  The bright green laser was wonderful, but there were times
when it was just spending way too much time on the crowd.  At various times
I looked towards the origin of the laser only to get an eyeful of green light,
resulting in a loss of vision for about ten seconds.  It got so bad that I 
simply resorted to dancing facing away from the DJ or making sure I was 
positioned in someone's shadow.  It is a cool effect to have the beams playing
upon the dancing masses, but when you have that many people with slowed
reflexes, even a fast-moving laser like that can do damage.  I really hate to
sound anal, but causing someone to lose their "VISION" like this is not cool.
I would also imagine aiming 12-watt lasers at people borders on the illegal;
someone was telling me after the Cyborganic Be-In (another place where that
same laser setup appeared) that if the "authorities" wanted to, they could
slap the organizers of any event which has lasers of that power aimed at crowds
with a fine of $100,000, and call the laser a public health hazard (along the
same lines as nuclear waste!).  Okay, maybe I'm paranoid.  But I happen to
like my eyesight. :)

Re: Lasers at Be-In. Brian. In fact, thee regulations on lasers are not so

  I'm sure that you really want to know everybody who reads the
SFRaves list personally so that you feel better knowing that no one is
reading your posts that you don't know.
  Come on.  This makes no sense.  SFRaves is open to the public more
or less.  Anyone who has the ability to find their way here (and
possibly not wander too far from topic) is welcome here.  Or so I
thought.  And if that means is through a public access,
quarter-sucking terminal with a UUCP connection, more power to them.
  I didn't know of any manifestation of person test required to be on
this list.  And there are plenty of lurkers here.  The anonymous point
is a non issue.

  And it seems rather hypocritical to bann a whole site from
subscribing just because there *may* be poeple from there who will add
too much noise to this list.  This could also prevent some very good
people from gaining access to such a resource.  Besides, you can't
really prevent anyone from posting here.  (At least not without a bit
of work from Brian and others).

Yeah... I got hit with a sneezing attack while on line for the porta-toilets,
and it seemed like everyone else in line was doing the same.  Fortunately
the attack subsided after about 1/2 hour (for me, anyway).

The place they held it (it seemed maybe twice as large as the Fashion
Center basement) used to be a metal foundry, so just imagine what kind
of lovely substances were inhaled  ;^)

No, but you missed Spun and Tony, who were also in top form.

I noticed that effect too, especially when they projected a simple
horizontally scanning beam.  The razor thin slice of smoke it
illuminated resembled constantly changing fractals.

Only, wasn't the laser green???

One of the organizers said he wished they'd gotten a more powerful
system, but I thought it was just right.

Interesting footnote:  the space had to be completely vacated by
9 am because it's used by the Livermore Fire Department for practice
of some sort (on Sunday morning???).  Anyway, that's what one of the
crew told me...

Good post Bob!  It's about time someone opened up this can-of-worms.  I'm

I'm not even sure I'd be this generous.  To me,  there is no relationship
between what happens on the list and the fact that some people on the 
list have decided to become event promoters, except for the fact that
these promoters have decided to use the list for there own special forum.
I have no problem with that whatsoever.  What I do have a problem with
is this idea that a mailing list is sponsoring *anything*.  The truth is
that *some people* who happen to be on the list are sponsoring things.  I'm
not sure at what point we can truthfully say the the list formally 
sponsors something.  Of course, people can say whatever they want.

Yes.  But should "largish" be a majority?  Of a voting quorum?  Should the
list grow into something more than a forum for communication?  A club
of sorts?  This could actually become interesting.  Perhaps it is natural
for communicatiomn -> cooperation -> organization.  Of course, with
organization comes structure and heirarchy which often evolves into
stratification, separation and alienation.  Then those who are alienated
can start their own mailing list...

Even legit events can get screwed up.  How much control do the members
(or, uh, representatives) of the list have over this sponsored event?  
Do we even know what we want the outcome to be?  How much money for 
charity does it have to make to be considered a success, or is having a
happy public party the main goal?

be having a can drive or something and we may have a benefit concert down here
in S.C. the weekend of the 18th to raise some monies, so, why not?

Subject: Re: SF Net soon to go UUCP!

Um, just a personal comment here...
	One of the things that I find so great about raves and ravers here
in San Francisco is the lack of clique-y elitism and the openness of the
scene in general.  This is one of the reasons Gunther and I decided to
move here (as opposed to other cities-we were -definantly- getting out
of Portland).  If you haven't been to events outside of the bay area, you 
may not realize that the attitude (small 'A') at most raves here is really
outstanding... in the NW, most events are merely boozefest extensions of the
local pick-up bar scene, which peter out after the bar closes. (Seattle may 
be having some good events, but I digress.)  There is a lot of Attitude and 
a lot of the friendly interaction between people just isn't there.
	So I think that it would be better if SFnet could get the calendar,
at least.  If there is any problem, Brian could always cut them off...
Besides, a lot of the calendar info is available from ameba and the be-at
line anyway.  Plus, the people who might cause a problem will probably be
more attracted to the raves that the majority of the people on this list
avoid in the first place.

Things are great when they are small. When some real power gets into
the picture people generally can't handle it. Already we're bickering
over the use of 'sfraves', whether to flyer for Alternity (of course
not!).

Once we're on SF Net the game is over; unsubscribe me. I usually think
of the SF Net station as one of the saddest sights I can see in a
coffee shop.

However, I think we all know that there is a lot of great energy going
into this post. Maybe we should go all the way, put ads on TV,
co-sponser every event we are asked, (who wouldn't ask, it's free
advertisement to a prime target audience). Let's blow the whole thing
up and kill the whole idea of raves, to move on to the next thing. With
our current rate of acceleration that should be around February 28th.

Love Garage is a good alternative to nights when 177 Townsend doesn'
pan out for you, which these days, is quite a bit.  Love Garage is right
behind it, and is actually a part of the Townsend Club, you'll see bemused
Toon Town promoters occasionally filtering in and out.  They charge $8.
The music and sound is excellent.  It's House.  Real House.  Sometimes it
gets deep, but mostly House.  No techno;l
ate into the night, however,
this music at Love Garage is going strong.  But then, I don't have a problem
with wailing divas.  The crowd was sparse when I went, mostly a mix of
fashion queens and various bra-clad tag alongs.  This is more along the 
lines of Carefree than Endup.  Simple space.  Simple decor.  A good time.

	My opinion is:  anyone who's willing to put up with 20 posted 
messages a day flowing into their account from sfraves is someone who
probably _won't_ be a problem to us.  I doubt someone in the "GoonTown"
crowd would be willing to spend 30 minutes a day reading all the stuff 
we talk about here.  I certainly don't think he'll have the time or
patience to print up every post and throw it around Haight.  As for the
calendar,  I know for a fact that it gets very wide distribution anyways,
so having it appear in a few more cafes isn't a problem for me.

	Also, think about this:  when I started the list, I knew next to
_nothing_ about the rave scene up here.  That's one of the main reasons I
started it!  So I don't want to close off access to others who will find
this an educational experience, too.  I'm sure many of you out there,
especially lots of you lurkers, were or are in the same boat (you'll be
surprised when I post the survey results (to be finished within two days!)
to see how many people have in fact _never_ been to a rave!).  

	Anyone with just a interest in "where can I pick up some chicks,
d00d?  How many kegs will they have there?" will probably find sfraves to
be a waste of their time.  ;->

In-Reply-To: bbehlen@soda.berkeley.edu -- 09/07/92 19:34

hi y'all!
i had looked with anticcccccccipation to this weekend -even foregoed (forewent?
) a trip to LA. the thing to do on sat. looked like the VISION thing. so,
a friend of mine, safi, and i phoned the nimfo line and got the directions.
from what they said it sounded like livermore. and yes, 30 min. of promoter's
time is about 40 min. of 'real' time. we got there  at about 2:40 am. safi and
i had already decided not to spend more than $10 for the rave - are we naive?
when we found out that they wanted $20 we offered $15, but they wouldn't budge.
we then decided to head back. too bad. so are there any raves for under $20 on
the weekend ? anyway, sunday we were determined to dance. some friends of mine
were visiting from ohio - most of them sf exiles anyway. we went to the dv8
thingie. we got there kinda early, 12 midnite. after about 30 wait in line.
once we got in we were pleasently assaulted by music. we explored all the
three floors and decided that the 2nd spacey floor was the best . my friends
were greatly excited by the beds on the 3rd floor in one of the chill rooms.
the music was good to great and the atmosphere seemed quite good. a lot of
young (new?) ravers with lots of energy. i really liked it and was a bit
surprised since i lowered my expectations once i figured that it was at
dv8, in a club. so i don't know that much. the only down side was that we
had to leave my 3am since my friends are not all-night-long types  and i
had to be a responsible host and leave with them.  finally, yesterday afternoon
i was with my friend erika near ford funston and bumped into a contigent of
ravers on a beach. the music was great and i really liked it. is this the
gg park rave, metamophosed ?

I haven't been listening to the radio for quite a few years, but
lately, I've been taping some radio programs that feature some
pretty good house music now and then.  On friday nites/Sat morn, 1-2:30 AM,
106.5 has a simulcast program from 177 Townsend.  107.7 has DJ EFX
doing house music from 12:30 - 3:30 AM on Friday and Saturday nites/morns.
The times are very approximate.  What I do is hook up my HIFI VCR
to the radio, and set the timer for a 4 hour block.  Then I sift through
it the next day and copy what I like to cassette.  I don't know if
the reception for these stations is any good outside SF.  Does anyone
know of any house music radio shows?

BTW, the DJ EFX show last Sat had Markie Mark on.  Apparently he is
also making some pretty good techno and will be performing at Townsend
this thursday with a bunch of other acts.  It sounds like this
townsend thing (sorry, I don't have the flyer in fron of me) is
going to be a fairly major techno/spiritual event, with both rooms
(177 townsend + 174 King St.) open.  They plan to turn the place
in a "temple".  It is being advertised in SF weekly though, so it
could be getting overhyped.  Then again, it is a thursday nite, and
summer is over.  On the hope that the promise of techno heaven comes
true, I'll be there.

Subject: sunday at the coast with sharon

ooh, i oughta get ten years in prison for that subject line.

anyway, it's sunday, i'm more or less functioning after melting some
of my lesser used brain cells at vision, and the phone rings.  "come
to the beach, there's some sort of party going on.  map point at
sunset and merced, actual event at blah blah blah...."  so i headed up
to the actual event location, only to be told that i had to go to the
map point cos they were likely to ticket and/or tow cars left on the
road.  i went to the map point just in time to see the colorful and
festive Rave Bus leaving without me.  bastards.  i was a bit shocked
to see the sharon logo on the fare-collector's car bumped, but i am
willing to give anybody a chance when they're only asking for $3.
eventually the bus returned. i paid my buckazoids and promptly sat
there for what seemed an eternity before finally getting underway.
fortunately, it was only a 3 or 4 mile ride to the beach.

i got through the gate and looked down from a high clifftop on a most
amazing valley.  unfortunately, the easy way down to the rave locale
was a very long circular trail, but i was unwilling to risk my life on
the cliff, so i walked it like the wimp i am.  i immediately ran into
some friends, and heard some very excellent tribal stuff from the very
excellent Rick Preston (unfortunately he went temporarily insane and
played a lot of old 70's disco... ooooeeeeeyuck.)

after watching the sun set, i decided to leave soon afterwards cos it
was getting dark and cold and i still had to take that wacko bus back
to my ravemobile.  not to mention that my friend and i were in dire
need of food.

a fun little mellow relaxing beachside event for a very modest price.
seemed like a good scene.  i wish i had arrived a little earlier so i
could have enjoyed it a little more.  next time i'll go straight for
the map point...

Well, I think this issue SHOULD be discussed and maybe put to a vote.

While I think that any outright business ventures should not use 
the sfraves name, I see no problem in sfraves at large co-sponsoring
or even promoting events anymore then I have a problem with SIGGRAPH
co-sponsoring or promoting their yearly meetings, charging admission to
the film/video show and co-ordinating plane tickets and hotel accomodations.
One of the great things about virtual communities, of which sfraves could
definately be classified as one, is that they tend to operate as a consensus.


So what do you all think?

Should we, the small group of people interested in doing these types of events:

1) continue to use sfraves as a forum/medium/organizing tool and use the sfraves
   name on flyers or whatever.

2) continue to use sfraves as a forum/medium/organizing tool but put some
   other name on the flyers (i.e. brought to you by The SF-BORG :)

3) start a seperate list for people who want to promote/organize/throw events
   and otherwise do stuff that you don't want the sfraves list subject to.

4) all of the above.

5) other (please specify)_______________________________________________________


VOTE FOR ONLY ONE!

Also some of you lurkers out there, here is a chance to participate in some
electronic democracy.

This is starting to sound like the discussion we had around the time of
the busted FMR in May.  I am opposed to any sort of exclusionary practise.
However, a couple of times when people have made posts that I feel were
"noise", I've written them.  Fortunately there hasn't been any 
net-terrorist on the list yet (some people have come close, but 
later rescinded).  I have no problem with removing someone who seems
to see sfraves as his/her private chat line, if only for the sake of
sparing soda the extra traffic, and even adding a shell script to make
sure that particular person _can't_ post to sfraves.

I also think that my welcome message does a fairly good job of letting
new people know what we are, where we stand, etc., to reduce (elimanate?)
the chance of the list "plummeting".  I'm appending the welcome message
to the end of this note to refresh everyone's mind about what it says.

I am sensetive to what everyone is saying, and I'm doing all I can to make
sure the list remains useful.  But part of that is infusing the list with
new blood every once in a while....

B) we dont need to vote because i think as long as things are brought

I don't see the connection here - how would allowing SFNetters have access

Subject: Attitudes, Raving, Love and Life

I was spending my usual sunday in balboa park just hanging around talking
when everyone noticed a particular guy was wlking in our direction.
He had been to the park a few times before and introduced himself
as having something to do with ToonTown (which becuz of this list
didnt make to good of an impression on me) and he had a whistle
that he blew out of sync with the music, and it was really annoying 
anyway cuz the music is usually really mellow.

WEll anyhow, we see him walking up and start to grumble,
but all at the same time everyone seemed to think
'Wait!  We arent here to be stuck-up and elitist,
we are here to accept everyone for who they are,
and the attitude we're showing right now really sucks'

or something along that line, because in a few seconds
everyone started saying 'Yeah its great he could come,
lets just ask him not to blow his whistle'
and thats basically what happened

it was very nice to see a bunch of people 
actively not being obnoxiously elitist
when, considering they were the ones who owned the equipment
they really could have been

POINT BEING
who the hell are we to say who is 'kewl' and who isnt?
i only have a vague idea of what SF Net is,
but i have a very clear idea of a bunch of people
trying to close out others from a group based
on openess and acceptance

i could refute some things about the manner of getting
accounts and what not, but i dont think any of that matters
i didnt think that raving was about accepting those people
that you like, that liked all the same music
that have the same clothing style as you
that have the same haircut as you
that dance like you, in just the right clubs
and with the right people

there is a guy at balboa who always goes out and talks to the
people staring at us dancing, sometimes he passes out fliers
other times he just sits and talks to them,
they are usually people 40+ sometimes they look like they are in their 60's
or older... it kinda reminded me of a group of christians
going out and talking to people, trying to spread their message

im not saying that we should all become evangelists,
but there is a message to be spread here,
and its really hard to get anything out of a locked up box

Subject: sharon beach party/rave at "the cove" kicked butt! // connection II


This was a >> 24 hour event, though I only attended Sunday from 4-10PM and
Monday 3PM-1:30AM. Beautiful location in a sheltered beach-cove in Daly
City.  The music was the most varied I've ever heard at a "rave".

For example, when I got there on Sunday afternoon, I arrived just as they
were playing Tom Brown's "Funkin' For Jamaica (NY)" -- a very cool rare
groove cut that David Trumbull turned me on to (yeah, the tape's coming
your way so shaddup!)... continued along into lots of other slow-n-groovy
rare groove funk tunes.

Later, I nearly lost my lunch when they started playing "bad disco", e.g.
'Ring My Bell' by <????>, but was still happy to hear more variety than
your average techno fare. (I get bored if I have to listen to nothing other
than techno for hours on end).

Techno was certainly on the menu, but it did not dominate the tune
selection. The breadth of variety became evident on Monday evening, when
they even went into a big reggae & raggamuffin set. They played some really
cool Shabba Ranks mixes, including Shabba rapping over a housy-sounding
track. Sorry, but I didn't keep track of (nor recognize) any of the DJs. 

Once the sun set, the overall scene looked very tribal -- there were lots
of fires circled by people jerkin' it and workin' it to a relatively loud
soundystem. There even had yer wanna-be flowerchild women sittin around the
campfires topless.. and the folx on the sandy dancefloor near the speakers
were going off!

I met a lot of friendly folx. I saw only one other SFRaver -- Taxi (Hi!).

The police basically didn't bother the party all weekend -- supposedly at
some point on Sunday night (after I was gone) they walked down the hill saw
that the party was in control, and walked back up the hill again without
hassling anybody. Later on, they supposely asked for the music to be turned
down, but otherwise didn't bother any of the people that camped out
overnight.

Unfortunately, the police came back around 1:30 AM monday night (actually
tues morning) and asked that the music shut down and that the crowd go
home. I didn't stick around to see if the party continued after that, as I
had actually planned on leaving about 5 hours before (but i couldn't
because the party and the music just got better and better).

The cover was $3.00, which included a continuous bus/shuttle service to a
nearby safeway parking lot, as well as the Lake Merced parking lot off of
Sunset ave. I'd estimate there were roughly 150 people there at the peak.

WE SHOULD DEFINITELY CONSIDER USING THIS SITE FOR THE NEXT CONNECTION.

If anybody wants to check it out, it's a few miles past (south) of where
Great Highway hits Skyline (35). Take skyline south towards Daly City.
You'll see some horse stables off to your right, in front of a cliff
leading down to the Ocean. Go a few hundred more yards and there's a small
parking lot with a fence blocking off a dirt road leading down to the
ocean. Go around the fence and walk down the path (about 1 mile) down to
the beach....

Note that this is a relatively small site -- if Connection II is held at
this location, we should definitely keep it word of mouth. I don't think it
would be good to have more than 200 people show up.

Sorry to contribute to the non-rave noise here, but this is a very bad
idea.  Here's what would happen: all of us, overwhelmed even by the amount
of email coming from the private list, gradually stop reading and posting
to the public list and thus cease to induct new members into the sfraves
community.  Either the public list would be all noise, or it would grow
into a separate community more-or-less unrelated to the current sfraves
except by the 'scene' itself.  I don't have any experience with SFNet, but
I'm sure that there are far less reputable public BBS's from which people
could subscribe to sfraves if they cared-- I really think that this is a
molehill into mountain sort of thing.

Gets my vote.
The parallel to SIGGRAPH seems inapplicable.  That's an organization with
a membership, budget, by-laws, &c.  the list is a self-selecting communications
medium that is a great place for organizers to get help, &c, but it
shdn't be the organization itself.  For all I know there's republicans on it!

events are OK by me but I don't want the 'promote' part to be done 
in 'our' name.  The park thing was a *mistake* on the part of the organizer.
I'd hate to see a separate list, tho, cause anybody out here is a potential
organizer.  That's what the list is good for.  I just don't want it to be
a trademark.  SF-BORG soundz ok to me.

I think this way you can be free to organize and promote rave events
without being burdened by trying to get a consensus for everything 
you do.  SFRaves can still be used as a resource and a sounding board
for your activities, and I for one happen to enjoy getting an inside
scoop on this aspect of the rave scene.

	Definely number 1: of course we need to find a procedure to follow in

	The Sf net discussion is an example: from the e-mails it looks like

	(besides the weekly list).

	The great advantage of using e-mail as a forum/medium/organizing tool

	When there is a big controversy, our system administrator/moderator

This has already happened here, on occasion. The size and background of the
potential members of an electronic community (like sfraves) are only two of
the factors involved in determining whether the quality of discussion will
take a slide.

As far as I know, Brian puts everyone who requests to be added on the list,
and has not removed anyone for misconduct (Vitamin B - pleeze correct me if
I'm wrong!). This is just like the "private" list described. We could
broadcast the calendar list, and that would be just like the "public" list
described.


/Andrea Parra <amparra@waffle.sns.com>/
>I have a problem making the SFRaves list available to those people...
>I don't want them cluttering my raves.  Sigh.

*THOSE* people! *YOUR* raves! Yikes. Since when do we own the whole SF rave
scene? And since when did become a classified information service? Most of
the information on the calendar list is available elsewhere (e.g. Ameba,
HouseWares) in other forms.

The sfraves list provides SF ravers a forum in which to exchange valuable
information about the SF scene. This helps make people "better rave
consumers:" Informed customers will avoid lame raves and attend good ones,
thus hurting the "bad" promoters and helping the "good" ones to survive. In
the long haul, this can only help the scene as a whole.


I think we should give SFNetters a chance. We should allow the calendar to
be posted, and we should allow SFNetters to subscribe to the list. If it
gets to be a problem, they can be easily removed. As far as problems
resulting from bogus accounts being set up from coffeehouses and added to
the list, I don't think this will be a problem for us for a few reasons:

First, as has already been mentioned, the traffic on this list is too great
for anyone who is not really interested to keep up.

Second, untended accounts will not cause _us_ any problems; they'll only
clog up the mail system on SFNet.

Third, we have no reason to suppose that SFNet accounts are more likely to
be bogus than any others on the list. I could easily create a bogus
computer account myself, add it to the list, and hurl abuse at all of you.
I could provoke arguments with people for the sake of argument. (Some of
you may think that I already do. =>8-]D ). But I haven't done this, and
neither has anyone else here (as far as I've been able to tell).

Fourth, if there does turn out to be a problem, it will be quite simple to
remove the "problem children" from the list. In other words, people who
don;t respect the space will be asked to leave.


Until now, there have been no exclusionary rules on who gets added to the
list. We should keep it that way, if at all possible.

Andrea:

OOOOO! and I bet they drink beer too. Shudder!

So tell me, is there anything intrinsically wrong with dating?

Are people that use media forms outside of the singles-bar/deesco/club
environment beneath us?

Or is dating just another passe/outre cultural artifact that true "moderns"
can dispose of? A sociological hiccup? An appendix of the heart?

Yeah, I realize that dating is a rather embarrassing, demeaning, and stupid
mating ritual, but jeeez, isn't everything? What do you suggest as a
replacement for human courtship, partnering, coupling, and reproduction?
The lottery?  Arranged marriages?  Mac-Playmate with special tactile VR
attachment? Sperm banks and Andrea-Dworkin-readin' motorcyle mommas
wielding turkey basters?

Perhaps we moderns should further sublimate our sexual natures into more
manipulation, rape, prostitution, hate, greed, power, drugs, money, etc?
You know, all those healthy byproducts of sexually repressed, stressed-out,
dominator-oriented, non-tribal, modern society.... So, Hey, now's our
chance to really fuck things up so that even 'normal' human courtship
rituals -- dating -- can be frowned upon!

It's too bad that in our lofty dreams of being conscious, exalted, refined
and human, we completely lose sight of the fact that we're animals, with
all the attendant rituals of courtship, mating, birth, and death. Cage that
animal, and watch the pathologies emerge. That's what modern life is about.

End Of Sermon.

--------------------

PS: I think the fact that people are using SF Net to get friday night dates
is great!  The sad thing is that SF Net is not very widely used...

In France, almost everybody has a Minitel at home -- a system similar to SF
Net, but as widely deployed as the telephone is here. The system has found
extreme success in getting people together, either romantically (the famous
"Lettres Roses"), or as friends. It has also been used to organize and
rally recent student protests over tuition-hikes in France. (the students
won!)

I see the protests against SF Net people joining as elitist/selfish -- it's
a "i got mine, you don't got yours, so fuck off" sort of attitude. So I
guess I can now justify saying "HEY, I HAVE A REAL ACCOUNT ON A UNIX SYSTEM
THAT I MAINTAIN MYSELF, ON A WORKSTATION THAT I CONFIGURED MYSELF. ANYBODY
ON NETCOM OR THE WELL OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC ACCESS SYSTEM SHOULD FUCK OFF
BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ENOUGH OR KNOW HOW TO ADMINISTER THEIR OWN UNIX
SYSTEM." Doesn't that sound like a real DICKHEAD thing to say? Why is it
any different from what youse people are saying about SF Net?

Finally, anybody on Netcom or the Well can join this list. I bet half the
people on those systems read ba.singles and go on dates too. Some even
drink beer!

Lastly, there is no possible way of preventing someone from posting to this
list unless Brian decides to moderate the list. Anybody with knowledge of
sendmail and RFC-822 can forge e-mail with little effort.

Hi,

I've been lurking sfraves for some 7 or 8 months now, I think, and I've
enjoyed the dialog though I've only made it to two raves despite intentions
to the contrary.  Events and my advanced age have conspired to keep me out
of commission.  Now, just when I thought things might lighten up, they've
gotten even worse and I'm afraid I'll have to cut back even further. Before
I fade out to calendar-only status, I wanted to mention something I've been
checking out that I think might be of general interest in that it involves
ecstacy (the experience not the drug), music, and groups.

It's a breathing technique called Holotropic Breathing by Stan Grof who
developed it. Basically, it involves invoking ecstatic experience by
listening to real loud music while breathing really fast for, say, three
hours at a stint.  You do it lying down with your eyes closed presided over
by a partner who sits and facilitates while you breath. There is often some
bodywork involved. I've done some 20 sessions now and it does seem to
effectively produce an altered state and also seems genuinely helpful in
giving people access to their personal knots in a way that helps unknot
them. It is primarily done in groups as its practitioners believe there is
an energy that groups produce that helps individuals with their own
process.

Grof is, perhaps arguably, the worlds foremost LSD expert. He started using
it as a Freudian analyst in Czechoslovakia back in the 50's. He stopped
being a Freudian but kept working with LSD until it became politically
impossible in '80s. He did manage to have one of the last research grants
allowing its use in the US. He's presided over something like 4000 LSD
sessions as a results and I found a book of his called Exploring Realms of
the Human Unconscious to be very helpful during my LSD days. It's
unfortunately out of print but he does have some more recent books that are
available. If raves are within the acid test tradition, Grof is more in
the Leary vein. His LSD sessions were done blind-folded while listening to
music through headphones. The focus is definitely on exploring internal
space.

Here are people who run sessions in the Bay Area--
       East Bay        Theresa Steinberg               510-540-4841
       SF              Laurie Weaver                   415-468-6930
       Santa Cruz      James Schofield &               408-429-1732
                         Kylea Taylor
Grof's institute is in Mill Valley at 20 Sunnyside Ave A-314, 94941.

I'd be happy to answer questions.

Gunther and I (later joined by Brad) decided to check out Funday Monday
last night -- to our surprise, it's been moved from the Bahia to Olive
Oil's at Pier 50, off of China Basin Road (south of the Lefty O'Doul
bridge and east of 3rd St.)  It's about 1/2 mile north of Mission Rock.

Although the sound system was indoors, there is an outdoor patio with
tables, which has a similar view and ambience to that of Mission Rock.
Bones and Special K were doing what I like club DJ's to do best --
mixing really good techno with deep and regular house.

The main drawback was too few people, but I think that might
have been because they haven't publicized the new location, and
because it was the end of a holiday weekend.  Spread the word, and
maybe we'll pack the place a bit more in the future.

Wow!  Is this getting out of control yet?

My opinion is that we're all taking this thing way too seriously.  This
list (and this culture in general) is all about fun, freedom, mutual
respect, and spontaneous organization, not about rules and bylaws.

Anyway, here's a vote for:

> 1) continue to use sfraves as a forum/medium/organizing tool and use the
> sfraves name on flyers or whatever.

Basically, I'm with Dana and Giamma.  Although sfraves is a virtual community,
it is Brian's brainchild.  He came up with the concept and the name, and
had the energy and foresight to put it together, not to mention orchestrating
two entirely successful events.  Ultimately I think it is his decision
whether to associate the SFR name with any event, but given his track record
in engineering consensuses (consensi?) I don't think we need to worry
about the name falling into the wrong hands.

I think anything *any* subgroup of us is involved in, as long as it doesn't
violate certain principles (which we ought to draft and agree on) can
carry our name -- for example, who could possibly object to Giamma and
Elizabeth putting on SFR lunches in the South Bay, even if only a handful of
people show up?

One of the main principles IMHO should be that we are non-profit and non-
commercial.  The event in the park meets this criterion.  Although it
was *initially* a mistake on the part of the organizer, if we had had
a chance to put the co-sponsorship up for discussion for a couple of days,
the end result would have been the same.  Unless I'm misreading the recent
traffic, few if any of you are seriously concerned about being associated
with this thing.

If anyone thinks we are truly going off in the wrong direction, why not
start a mailing list of your own (such as sfr-discussion-about-raves)?

I'm truly impressed with the compelling arguments,
epecially those posted today--which I won't

all know that change is a natural process; it will happen.          
Why, howver, push sfraves into arenas that are
both unnecessary and even antithetical to its

Subject: Amen! (Was Re: Dating (was Re: SF Net soon to go UUCP!))


I'm not one to pick fights or anything, but I really agree...I didn't hear
either side of the argument, but from my personal opinion, personal
computers, hell, *any* computers, are a tool, a meta-medium, which empowers
people to communicate and interact like never previously possible.  If
using these wonderful devices can bring about happiness, then so be it!!

I've met some wonderful people over the Internet, and various computer
networks.  I'm a pretty good looking guy with a pretty good head on his
shoulders, and a very strong future.  I'm far from the "nerd" who cannot
get a date, or the "jerk" out looking to play computer sex or whatever the
hell they do.  I'm an honest sincere guy, and yes, I've met people that
I've had relationships with over the computer, and yes -- I'd do it again.

Anyhow, how do I get on this "SF-NET" anyhow?  I'm lonely, and my friday
nights are spent alone as I just came out here from Chicago, live mostly at
work during the week, and Silicon Valley isn't exactly the place to go meet
women when you're under 21 (I'm 20).  I don't even have a car...  And
believe me, ladies, if you met me, I'm sure you'd think at the very least
that I was a pretty nice guy...  Bring on the flames!  I'm used to it.


Steve...

P.S.  Neils, I really admire your passion and intensity.  If there were
more
people with that kind of energy (like you and I), the world would be
a much more exciting place to live...

Posting the calendar there is probably ok, but SFNet shouldn't be allowed
in on the general discussion. A lot of the people on this list (my
impression) make an effort to knowing each other in person, and
the posters stand by their postings. I have seen too many discussion
groups go to pots when some immature person gain possession of a
temporary account or someone else's account and started posting
messages full of hatred and bigotry just to provoke reaction from the
group. The group ended up being 80% flames, 10% disscussion and 10%
please-stop-flaming-let's-go-back-to-normal for months, then
half the regular posters get disgusted and leave the group. SFNet 
access opens the group up to all sorts of abuse.
The traffic in this groups is high enough as is.
If they want an open forum, they can go to alt.rave.
Let's keep this a private list.

  Normally I try not to promote my own stuff too blatantly, but I've noticed

  indicated by asterisks.

  Unfortunately neither of these is available at the moment.  Twitch Volume 7

  month or two.  When they are released, all of these will be available at:
  Streetlight Records (SF, Market Street location only), BPM Records (SF),
  Star Records (SF), Record Rack (SF), House Wares (SF, CDs only), Underground

"Digeridoo" is nothing but a digeridoo growling and a very very fast
drum track over it.  It is definitely *not* multi-sectional and it was
definitely not played at Vision when I was there (11:30pm - 5:30am)

As for it being "The Trip"...errrr... could be, wabbit.  there's no
"house music will never die" chant but maybe you mistook the african
tribal chants, or the alice sample...?  the "really fast clicks" could
be the timbale solo, i suppose.  and yeah, there's lots of BOOM in it.
The most recognizable part is a screaming voice going "AHH AHH AHH
AHH" while the song gradually drops away behind it, leaving just the
voice getting louder and louder until your brain feels like it's going
to pop, then suddenly a huge crunching industrial drum track comes in
and you're bouncing uncontrollably, punching your fist in the air and
wondering why all music doesn't sound like this...  or something...

anyway, you will all have a chance to own your very own copy in just a
few weeks time.  watch sfraves for the announcement.

   Personally I think this discussion has very little to do with this
list, and more to do with the administrations of it (ie. Brian).  But
to make a few points clear (my understanding, correct me if I'm
wrong)...

  1.  The SFRaves mailing list would not be posted in full for
      everyone in the SF Net coffee houses to read.  For an SF Netter
      to read and contribute to the SFRaves list they would still have
      to get an account and ask Brian to add them to the list.  And
      they would still have to read through 10-30 messages per day.
      Nothing would become "public".  (though my view is that this
      list is already public.  It's an open club.  Anyone can join.)

  2.  It is not our job to second guess the quality of users on any
      new system connected to the net.  And it's certainly not our job
      to ban them from the discussion here. Many people would not be
      here were it not for public access systems like the Well.

  3.  Raving is about acceptance and power to the many.  I can't
      believe the elite-ism, selfishness and paranoia that people have
      displayed here.  The only way that a sense of "community" will
      be destroyed here is if you give up accepting and educating
      people in your community.  Locking people out only maintains a
      sense of cliqueism.  Please, give people a chance before you
      condemn them.  Don't judge them guilty before they have a chance
      to express themselves.  You would want the same for yourself.

  Can you imagine a raver coming up to Connection and somebody stops
them and says, "Hey, I hear you go to Toontown and Feel-X.  We don't
want your kind here.  This is only for the good ravers...."

  This list has done a lot to improve and uphold the rave community.
Don't let it stop now.

  I apologize for adding to more of the noise here and a thread that I
would like to see end.

  ========
  On a side note.  A Southern California Rave (SoCal-Raves) mailing
list will be up soon (as soon as I finish the welcome message).  Stay
tuned.

Uh, well 20 bones does seem like a lot, but If there is no alcohol to cover
promoters costs, then it seems a little more reasonable. I won't blink my
eyes at coughing up a 20 for a really good warehouse rave, since I bring what
I need with me and won't spend  another cent the whole night.. i.e. no
$4.00 buds or millers.. so there..

Leary never took this work one-thousandth as seriously as Grof does.

what bothers me more than prices that seem high are prices that seem secret. 
i get the impression that some organizers carefully omit the admission price 
from all publicity - handbills, info line, etc.  perhaps they would rather have 
us drive for an hour to an event site *then* decide whether or not to pay to 
get in, eh? 
 
this practice feels manipulative to me, though admittedly when i go to such 
events i am a willing participant in the practice.  maybe i should stop. 
 
seems to me the Gathering folks have done this before.  at the first Gathering, 
early this year, i remember being surprised by the $15 admission - a new high 
price-point.  ($10 was all i had ever paid for a rave before except for the 
toontown new year's extravaganza - at least there, tickets were priced and sold 
in advance - no surprises.) 
 
my memory of that first Gathering is that i got more "amenities" for $15 
(excellent music and sound quality, chill-out room, alternative music room, 
complimentary fruit in the morning, etc.) than i got for $20 from VISION.  the 
crowd energy at VISION seemed really super, though, and i suppose for those of 
us who have $20 to spend, that's what matters most.

i think it is usally good to avoid $20 raves 
cuz they are the ones where the promoter is in it for
the money and thats it, so why bother?
some of them can be fun and well worth the money
( Circa '92, for example)
but i dont think it really has nything to do with covering costs
becuz most of the people who put on the $20 raves
are already well off enough that they can cover costs
and if it gets busted half the time they just keep the money
or throw another rave where they let people in for 10 bucks
ripping off everyone who got the original tix

What pisses me off far more than the price of any given rave is that 
price information is so seldom obtainable before you arrive. I make 
a point to leave a very nasty message on any voice mail I get hold 
of about this. This has always struck me as very mean spirited, 
especially in light of the fact that I am sure there are many people 
like me who basically thumb their nose at any event that deosn't 
advertise a price, thus I think economically its debateable whereas 
ethically it is not. I feel so strongly about this issue that if I 
were in control of any service which listed or promoted events 
(like sfraves) I would make accurate price info an absolute 
necessity if any event wanted to be on my list/calender.

	I always put the price if it's available.  I think it's important
to know, too, and given the choice of a big event for $20 versus a smallish
event for $10,  I'll go for the smallish any day.  Usually it seems like
events held at clubs, like the Trocadero or 1015 Folsom or such, are less
expensive.

For me, it depends on the promoter.  $20 is expensive, but if it's a
Gathering or Hardkiss event, it has a better-than-average chance of
being good.  While I will give $5 to just about any promoter group if
I'm in the mood to rave, I will be a lot more circumspect before
tossing $20.  So, there's no hard and fast rule.  After their recent
twin botches at the Concourse Center and that ranch in Marin, I vowed
never to go to another Sharon (for the tenth time), but their party at
the cove in Daly City this weekend was a mere $3, so I figured even if
it sucked I hadn't lost anything important.

Here's my vote (although I completely agree that Brian can do
whatevever he wants too with the list and name, especialy 
because I happen to agree with him).

1) continue to use sfraves as a forum/medium/organizing tool and
   use the sfraves name on flyers or whatever.

Also, it has been mentioned and some people seem to think 
that there is a small core of people organizing these sfr
events. I feel obliged to point out that there are many people
doing everything from coordinating the events on a large
scale to investing money (or should I say loaning - they don't
earn any interest) to bringing fire wood, fruit, or glow-in-the-dark
baloons.  These events are open for anyone on the list to help
with and the only people who are excluded are those that exclude
themselves, which is O.K. too.

         Provide variety of music and a clear,tight,loud soundsystem
         and good visuals.
         Provide friendly but firm security,not "goons"
         Provide adequate off street parking so rave doesn't impact
         on community.
         Provide adequate toilet facilities,more for women.
         Smart Drinks:big and chilling.Juice over "Tang",nix on caffeine..
           (feel free to disagree with me on this..)

         No In's and Outs...
         Lying on permits (this fucks it up for everybody else..)
         Laeve lots of litter,esp. flyers for the locals to have to clean up.
         Allow fights in parking lot..
         Allow guys hassling women,"hey baby" syndrome..
         Let smoke machines run continuously
         Sell tickets at map points after party is over
         Lie about required closing times or cancellations of DJ's/acts.
         Be secretive about admission price
         Only allow women in without standing in a long line....
         (This,I've heard is a problem in LA and in some other cities..)

this doesn't really have a lot of relevance to the SFNet discussion
because you need a computer and a modem at least to be able to do what
the above person is doing.  SFNet mail will be easily filterable.
Actually, if you have a sophisticated enough mail handling system, you
can filter out messages from the above forger without too much
difficulty.

besides, unlike many list administrators, brian takes an active
interest in the list contents.  i have faith in his ability to stem
the tide of abuse, should it ever occur.

but hey, enough doom 'n' gloom.  the doors to sfraves should be open
to all.  if we start being all elitist and exclusive, then we become
the things we hate.

Subject: an offer and a plea


	Because of the immense number of sfraves posts last night (by one
count at least 61 sendmails were cocurrently processing), the people who
use and run soda have begun to complain.  The main effect sfraves has 
upon Soda is not disk space per se, but memory and processor time. A level
of 20 posts a day is perfectly fine; but 61 was apparently the breaking
point.  In a matter of weeks, when the machine we call Soda gets its
processor power tripled, memory increased, and disk space quadrupled,
this will be a non-issue.  But for now a few steps have to be taken to
ensure our survival.

	1)  They are going to implement a "sendmail budget" hack, such that
only three sendmail processes will be running at the same time. Every message
sent to sfraves will still get through, but it will take longer.  Please have
patience.

	2)  I will begin shunting some mail to a secondary machine, which I
will announce as soon as I'm sure it's working.  It's not a machine that
would be capable of doing what soda can't, but it can handle a few sfraves
posts a day.  Please reserve the use of this machine to time-critical posts,
such as Full Moon Info, the Calendar, etc.

	So anyways, this is temporary, and I don't this to have a chilling
effect on the list.  As much as I may disagree with those of you who want to
keep SF Net out,  the discussion has been interesting and perhaps necessary.
It's all a part of this abstraction we call a community.


	And now, for the fun part.  I got this message from Craig Larson,
the man (for those of you at Connection) who was running the video setup,
and also one of the original ToonTown (when it was good!) promoters, who's
helping organize the rave in Santa Cruz the night after ours.

>From paul@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.us Wed Sep  9 21:03:02 1992

     Hi Brian....Craig Larson here... 

     Because the Adults in Santa Cruz want to have a Rave we have the option of
pulling a permit for the SC Main Beach in front of the Boardwalk (or one of the
other city or county beachs) for Sunday morning 8:00 am until ?..... for the
post Civic Auditorium party...I was just wondering if you are coming down for
the Civic event would you be interested in starting up the beach in the morning
while I close down the Civic and unload the gear and stuff?....This would be the
first aboveground beach rave in Santa Cruz and could be a lot of fun to hear
rave music while riding the roller coaster and playing all the games etc...
There are already a lot of people with equipment and sound gear in orbit...we
just need a group of folks to put it all together and watch over it etc ... what
do you think? 
      Thanks for the great party in SC you guys did recently...it was soooo
nice...if you think this is worthy of consideration feel free to post it so that
it can be more communally discussed.

                                                  ...Craig

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm all for this;  the thought of combining the feel of the Boardwalk and
that of a Sunday afternoon beach rave is quite exciting.  The beach there
is great, for those who haven't visited it.  I'm pretty sure I could scare
up some DJ's for the event, if we could do a good job of collecting money.

Subject: charities named for the GG park benefit


Actually, they haven't been named yet, but here's the scoop:

Last night I went to a meeting of all the promoters involved in
the event;  as far as charities, we agreed that we will split the
proceeds among three charities: one dealing with the rainforest,
one dealing with battered children/orphans/etc., and the third
will be clothing/food collection for the homeless.  The exact
charities weren't selected:  one person is going to research each
subgroup and report back on which one was most legit, and we'd decide 
on Friday night or Saturday morning before the event.  Hurricane
relief came up, but was voted against since the Government will be
footing the entire bill anyways.  AIDS also came up, but some of the
promoters were afraid that people would think of this as "just another
AIDS benefit", and wanted to do something different.  We chose three
because we wanted to have a wide impact, rather than focusing on 
solely one issue, and we also wanted to avoid having people think of
the event purely as a fundraiser for a particular cause.  

They really want the focus to be on the positive aspects of raves,
and they're mainly interested in increasing the image of raves in the
media and public eye.  

As far as our role in the event, I said I could offer myself and three
others (at least) who could help with donation collection, and I also
offered to make staff badges.  I also donated some money to help get the
permits ahead of time, and I should that back (minus my personal donation,
of course.)  They want _everyone_ to help donate, so that means no
"guest lists", etc....  Sounds good to me. :)

I really urge everyone to go to it, at all costs.  This will be a major
media event, and the media needs to see people like us there to know
that raves aren't just hundreds of drug-crazed teenagers looking for
trouble.  We will be doing some info-flyering there, too, like I did at
GG-park a few months ago.

I know Marlo was saying she thought this would be really

I called the info number on the IMAGINATION flyer, and (a)
got no new information, and (b) got to hear Adam (?) finish
up by saying "We *LOVE* you!" 

More like they love our twenty dollar bills.  Or maybe it's
more than that?  They don't want to say.

$15.  I'm not an expert on all the L.A. raves, but from the ones

For my part in this discussion I am now beginning to feel a little
chagrined.  Urging caution/discussion wasn't meant to mean kill the
bastards.  So far the best solutions to this little connundrum seem to be
1) All are welcome here until they prove themselves un...
2) If it seems someone is trashing the list or the gigs that result, we can
always remove 'em.
3) The style of anarchic/discussion wherein we all opine at will then try to
find a common thread in the ideas expressed seems a lot more tribal and
appropriate to this medium than a formal vote.  Voting tends to restrict
options to a few carefully articulated ideas rather than allowing things to
grow/form at their own pace.
I've learned all of the above in the last few days, and thru watching this
discussion proceed at its own pace.  I was urging keeping SFNets off, but it
seems that kewler ( :-) in many ways) heads are beginning to prevail.

In any case, one thing that has definitely emerged is a feeling that all of
us like what is happening here and don't want it "spoiled".  Me too.  Brian
has consistently urged us to remember that we all came here from somewhere
else as newcomers, so what's wrong with other newcomers.  He's probably
right. :-) Good show B.  Steve.

Athough this is one of the goals of the project, let me hasten to add
that this is *not* the main focus of the event -- the most important goal
is to raise as much money as possible and do something for the good of
society.  We don't want this to come off primarily as a self-conscious bid
for good PR.

Another outcome of this project is to increase a feeling of unity among the
various organizers on the local scene, and to concentrate on keeping
the overall energy positive rather than mean-spirited and competitive.

Subject: pricing info and caffeine (was Re: Suggestions for promoters.)


(1) Re: lack of price info on flyers and phone msgs -- Perhaps the
promoters don't want to have any evidence of how much the event costs
per person for IRS/Tax reasons? After having layed out huge sums of
$$$ to the IRS this year, I'm becoming more and more sympathetic to
the concept of untraceable, unreportable cash-only income.... 

(2) Re: caffeine at raves -- I disagree -- caffeine is one of my
favorite drugs. I've actually had very good times at raves after
drinking two double cappucinos and having a smart drink or two. Then I
can bounce off the walls just as well as my tripping brethren and
sistern and still have all my neurons intact the next day. Caffeine
also lasts about 5 hours, which is just right for doing a 1AM-6AM rave.

Although being caffeinated to the gills can be a bad trip if you're
sitting around in an office, I find that it's a great thing for
aerobic activities (dancing), or intense sports (skiing, boogie
boarding, mountain biking).

Just an opinion. Bet you never expected ME to have an opinion now didja?

Although like Niels I bristle at the socio-technological elitism implied by
many people arguing against incorporating SF Net into sfraves, the
compelling argument against doing so (for me) is that the traffic
*is* getting too large.  Why not view this list as a rave that we
want to keep to human scale -- so let's not print 100,000 glossy 4-color
flyers (or the electronic equivalent).

Distribute them the calendar, sure, why not?

As far as homes for battered children go, there's the Burt Center in
SF (on the corner of Grove and Steiner).  I think they deal primarily
with abused children, although they may do other things also.  I have
a couple of friends who work there.

Subject: charities named for the GG park benefit
Status: RO


Actually, they haven't been named yet, but here's the scoop:

Last night I went to a meeting of all the promoters involved in
the event;  as far as charities, we agreed that we will split the
proceeds among three charities: one dealing with the rainforest,
one dealing with battered children/orphans/etc., and the third
will be clothing/food collection for the homeless.  The exact
charities weren't selected:  one person is going to research each
subgroup and report back on which one was most legit, and we'd decide 
on Friday night or Saturday morning before the event.  Hurricane
relief came up, but was voted against since the Government will be
footing the entire bill anyways.  AIDS also came up, but some of the
promoters were afraid that people would think of this as "just another
AIDS benefit", and wanted to do something different.  We chose three
because we wanted to have a wide impact, rather than focusing on 
solely one issue, and we also wanted to avoid having people think of
the event purely as a fundraiser for a particular cause.  

They really want the focus to be on the positive aspects of raves,
and they're mainly interested in increasing the image of raves in the
media and public eye.  

As far as our role in the event, I said I could offer myself and three
others (at least) who could help with donation collection, and I also
offered to make staff badges.  I also donated some money to help get the
permits ahead of time, and I should that back (minus my personal donation,
of course.)  They want _everyone_ to help donate, so that means no
"guest lists", etc....  Sounds good to me. :)

I really urge everyone to go to it, at all costs.  This will be a major
media event, and the media needs to see people like us there to know
that raves aren't just hundreds of drug-crazed teenagers looking for
trouble.  We will be doing some info-flyering there, too, like I did at
GG-park a few months ago.

Micheal Bennett writes:

> Also, I understand this is the harvest moon, whatever that is.

The harvest moon is last full moon of the summer. Summer ends at the
Autumnal Equinox, which is the 21st or 22nd of September. The
equinoxes (there are 2 each year) are the days when the length of the
day is equal (well, very close) to the length of the night.

The reason the last moon of the summer is called "the harvest moon"
has to with orbital geometry. Whenever there is a full moon, the
moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun. If the Earth's
and the Moon's orbits were coplanar, there would never be a full moon: 
there would be a lunar (and solar!) eclipse every month. 

Since the Moon is directly opposite the Sun in the sky during a full
moon and we're near the equinox, when the Sun is setting, the Moon
will be rising. So right when the Sun's light is fading, the Moon's light
will provide additional time to work outdoors. At harvest time, when it
is most needed by agrarian societies. Therefore, "the harvest moon."

This probably more than you wanted to know, and is the result of a 
misspent astrophysics education :-)

	SFRaves has a new home (AGAIN??!?!?!) temporarily.  John Reuling
(reuling@medisg.stanford.edu) has been kind enough to allow his site to be
used until Soda gets upgraded.  You don't have to worry about this; 
sfraves@soda is immediately forwarded to medisg, so you can continue to
mail to sfraves@soda without any worry.  The only change you'll see is the mail
will say, "From: sfraves-request@medisg.stanford.edu", which is yet another
alias sending the mail back to me anyways.  The main result:  sfraves survives,
which is a good thing. :)  If for some reason Soda is down, feel free to
send it to medisg directly;  but for the sake of continuity I would prefer 
people to continue to funnel it through soda, so when we can come back there
it won't be a hassle.

Subject: The Birth of the SoCal-Raves mailing list! 

 
 
  Yes, blink twice, throw some salt over your left shoulder and don't 
trip over your cat as you rave till you drop because the Southern 
California Rave mailing list is now here! 
 
  The SoCal-Raves mailing list is dedicated to discussing all things
rave and underground clubbing in the Southern California area
including the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside,
San Bernardino, and possibly Ventura and Santa Barbara too.
  Discussion will center around the Southern California area but 
people outside of this are certainly welcome to join. 
 
  Topics will include: 
       - announcements of upcoming events in the Southern California area.
       - reviews of shows/raves/DJs/music/etc.
       - rave-culture like clothes, smart drinks, rave attitude, etc.
       - local radio shows and stations that play rave and techno.
       - where to find the music, clothes, etc.
       - rave picnics and other non-rave rave-related events.
       - how to throw your own rave (and not get busted).
       ...and almost anything else rave related or related to the
          Souther California scene.

 To subscribe to the SoCal-Raves mailing list send a message to
socal-raves-request@ucsd.edu with the line "sub socal-raves" in the
body of the message.  Subscription problems should be sent to Andy
(Vigor Mortis) at socal-raves-relay@ucsd.edu.
  Any other questions or comments about the list should be sent to me 
at jvance@einstein.oac.uci.edu and are greatly appreciated. 
 
  Thanks go out to all those who expressed interest in a SoCal-Raves 
list and may have even tried to start your own.  Hope to see you 
there! 
 
  Peace and Love

I think it's the full moon closest to the vernal equinox (the
day the sun appears to have crossed south of the equator - the
first day of fall).  However, I'm not real sure if that's what
makes a harvest moon.  Anyone?

Hi Chris... Craig Larson here...I think we do know each other...you're 5'10"
with shorter brown hair, glasses and wore the elf hat... I'm 6'2", glasses and
have long brown hair in a pony tail...

Jan Mueller and I created "live" all of the video for Toon Town last year 
starting with all the 650 Howard parties right through Toon Towns Big Adventure
to LA last year for the Cyber Arts show with Credo Production (I arranged the
show).

It sure was fun working with Reed and Preston and Jeno and J&K Sound last
year...personally I am still kind of heart broken over Mark getting nasty
and forcing Preston to leave so he could be a "Big Shot".  I haven't worked a
video show for Toon Town since....

Nice to see know how to type...(joke).

Reed is going to try to come down to the Santa Cruz Hurrican Relief Show on 
September 26...of course you are invited to bring your smart bar too.

Because Santa Cruz realllllly got hit in the earthquake and Florida contributed
quite a bit to us....We feel an obligation to do something back.

The local city council is contributing some money and the rest of us would like
to do a concert or rave or something to raze a bit more...if you know what I mean.

This will be a big deal for Santa Cruz and of course all my unknown buddies are
invited.

Hope to see you there...or at a rave near you soon ..

Just to be a little bit anal retentive (aka nit-picky) the half life of
caffeine is >16< hours.  That means that after 5 hours there is still a
very significant amount of it left in your body, probably a good 80% of the

Subject: An Affordable I MAGI NATION




 The admission was a $12.00 'donation' - $10.00 if you plead poverty. I 
was told that admission was free after 4AM, but I was too tired to bother 
to verify this.

 The experience began in the hallway leading from the entrance to the bar 
room. There was a kinetic sculpture of a tree with moving heads. Some 
projections and a strobe, plus a poor man's Dream Machine ( a halogen 
bulb hanging in a rotating bucket that had vertical rectangular slots cut 
into it ).

 The bar room was occupied by a smart/juice bar, jewelry, an overhead 
projection screen, a candy table, the "Weird Blinking Lights" table, and 
the Darwin Chamber merchandising table ( shirts and tapes ). Upstairs, in 
one room was located a video/projector chill space, which metamorphosized 
into a rather harsh sonic environment later in the evening. The open 
space upstairs was occupied by some "Weird Blinking Lights" LED 
electronics and sculpture. In the same open upstairs space was the magik 
group, who performed various rituals through the night.

 The dancefloor really didn't hit a cosy dancer density until about 1 AM. 
I saw two live performances; the first was by two guys who I thought 
introduced themselves as "The Entity", but the flyer says "Mindarc", so 
who knows? They played a dancible, but somewhat anonymous synth sound. 
The second performance I saw was another duo called Darwin Chamber - I 
liked them! Their use of samples adds a deeper dimension to the dance 
beats, and it doesn't hurt that they have a cartoon sense of humor. As 
I'm writing this, I'm listening to one of their tapes. The address on the 
tape inner sleeve implies that they're from San Rafael.

 Before and after the performances, the music was provided by the DJs. Of 
the DJs listed on the flyer - Jeno, Garth, Markie Mark, ( and Synthesis ? 
), I liked Garth the most. Of course, Markie Mark came on after 3:15, 
when I was starting to fade out.

 BUT - I was very impressed with the large ambient chill room in the 
back! Good projections, and a smart toast bar ( more about that later ), 
but the SOUND! It seems they approached the owner of Auricular Records to 
gather together members of various local experimental/ambient industrial 
bands to provide the sonic environment. So, behind a twenty foot long 
array of tape machines, synths, samplers, electronic effects, and 
acoustic instruments were members of IAO Core, Big City Orchestre, Nux 
Vomica, and others - jamming on the machines together as SENSE/NET. I 
happen to like ambient industrial , so I was enjoying it a lot. I just 
wish there was a division of the room into a talking section and silent 
section, for folks like me to really get deep into the sonic soup without 
being distracted by the conversations of others.

 I understand that Auricular is planning to release an edited version of 
the night's set.

 Above the floor was the projectors, as well as patron participation area 
where people could "play" sounds by passing their hands in front of light 
sensors. This area was set up by a business (?) called ODDERNMART. Their 
info says that they're on 1387 Baker St. in SF - (415) 346-8129.

 And then, there was the smart toast! Two gals sharing the Auricular 
Rcords merchandise table were selling toast, with or without jelly mixed 
with nutrient powder. I had a slice of sourdough, a little butter, and 
strawberry jelly mixed with Vital Health Food Supplement Cocktail powder. 
It tasted good, and was something a little solid to go with all the water 
and juice I had been drinking.

 Other SFRavers I saw at I MAGI NATION - The Normals, Lee Fogel, Jon 
Pincus, Marlo, a "Weird Blinking Lights" guy, and Brad (?) outside as I 
was leaving. For those of you who don't know my face, I was the guy wearing
the HAWKWIND t-shirt. ( by the way, I didn't remember to look for 
you, Eric, until I got home and re-read your posting! How did the magik
rituals go? I thought it would be too bloody noisy for that kind 
of activity ! ).

------------------

      It's 11AM, and I'm going to stay up long enough go to the opening
of HELLRAISER III: HELL ON EARTH. Then, back home to sweet (?) dreams.

We too had a great time at I Magi Nation.  We're really hoping to see more
ambient/chill spaces in clubs as it is wonderful to be able to have a place
to cool out and uncrank.  The bass from the main dancefloor boomed through
the wall into the ambient room, but the musicians adapted to it and wove
their music into and around it.  Great visuals, too, by a group of artists
including the stellar Phylace Laurie.  The two of us have really been
getting into the whole ambient side lately.  We thought $12 was a bit high
for thursday night indoors, but left feeling that it was worth it.  Garth
was just amazing - he almost always works for me, though!   Looking forward
to the FMR - or so we hope.  Anyone going with car space, let us know!

Davenport is 8 miles North of Santa Cruz on Highway 1... That's
about 35 miles South of San Gregorio Beach (where 84 and 1
intersect) and 69 miles South of Pacifica.   Coming from Davis,
your best bet is to just take 880/17 to Santa Cruz and follow
the signs to 1 north...

 I just woke up an hour ago, and so I've missed the FMR ( which I wasn't
planning on going to anyway ), but I predict that it will get a lot more
negative police presence than CONNECTIONS. I base my prediction on a negative
clue - none of the postings about FMR have mentioned a bus or a legal parking
area. CONNECTIONS managed to attract tons of folks without anyone knowing 
who sfraves was. Even though the FMR was announced at the last minute, I still
suspect a ton of folks appearing.  If that many folks start parking at
random near the vicinity of the site, I'm sure it's going to piss the cops
off more than CONNECTIONS' parking arrangments.

 Anyway - I'm going to have a leisurly breakfast at Zachary's in Santa Cruz,
then stop off at Bonny Doon to see how it all turned out.

				See you folks at GoldenGate Bandshell!

Subject: Bonny Doon FMR - fantabulous


	You'll never know the jolt of adrenalin I got at 10:30 last night
when Malachy called me and said (paraphrasing): "Well, we have the same
site as last time all set up, but we'd really like to do it someplace
different.  We'd like to do it on Bonny Doon.  Would you be able to help
us?"  Yow.  I was simultaneously excited by the prospect and scared shitless.

	The main reason, in my mind, that Connection was able to be so 
successful and remain unbusted was that a lot of planning went into making
sure, or at least trying to make sure, no cars were parked on the highway
and few cars were on Bonny Doon.  The FMR would have none of this luxury.
We had the benefit of being able to haul in equipment and set it up over a
relatively long period of time.  the FMR wouldn't have this.  There was
a definite ting of panic in my brain as I raced down hwy 1 at 90 mph.

	I got to the beach at 12:45.  I was afraid I was late, that the sound
guys had already arrived and hauled the equipment over.  So I went to check out
the surroundings.  A few campfires, about a dozen or so cars in the parking
lot belonging to teenagers, but no Malachy.  Steve and a friend were there
when we arrived, and slowly over the course of the next hour and a half about
50 more ravers showed up... but still no Malachy and no sound system.  Finally
at 3 in the morning, the van pulls up, and we tell him to park in the south
end to make the hauling easier. 

	I had visions of the fun we had hauling stuff at Connection going 
through my head, so I went down to the beach, where by this time the 50-75
ravers had built a bonfire, and asked/yelled, "The sound system has arrived.
We need every available person to help haul equipment so we can get this party
started as soon as possible".  About 30 people step forward.  The system was
unloaded and on the beach within 15 minutes.  Incredible.

	All this time, Geoff, Andrei, and myself were watching the parking lot,
telling the people to park on BD road with varying degrees of success.  There
was one car, a pickup truck with a shell, with a solitary man sitting in it.
>From up close you could hear a CB/radio in it.  Through some indirect 
conversation with him, we came to the definite conclusion that he was some sort
of off-duty cop, perhaps an undercover cop, checking out the situation.
Apparently he liked what he saw.  Not a single cruiser, not a single CHP,
no cops showed up at all (even though there were twice as many cars in front
of the beach than at Connection).  No parking tickets.  No towing.  I was
stunned.  The man in the car eventually left;  I guess he figured we had it
under control. :)

	And now for the party.  The set up the sound system (about the same
size, but a little louder than the Connection one) in a cove next to the
cliffs, which formed a bandshell-like backdrop that worked perfectly.  There
were several campfires that raged through the night, and many people brought
tents.  At its peak there were perhaps 300 people there, which is incredible
considering Malachy didn't send out the "official" word until 11:30 or so.

	Unfortunately I had to leave at 6:30 because I had to be here, at 
work, at 9 (I get off at 11, just in time to drive to GG park) (yeah, dumb
work schedule, I know).  The moon was thinking about setting... the weather
for the night was absolutely perfect.  As I was leaving I did see a Santa
Cruz County cruiser drive up and down BD road, but he didn't stop. Hrm...

	Malachy was very impressed with those of us who had helped run

Subject: Charity rave a huge success!

I'm sure Brian will have a lot to add, but I just wanted to report that
the charity rave in the park was a blazing success.  We raised $1500 that
will be split with the majority going to the Burt Children's Center, a S.F.
shelter for abused and abandoned children, and the rest going to the
Rainforest Action Network.  The bulk of collecting was done by SFR volunteers.

The day got off to a slow start, as the sound system that had been lined
up for the event failed to appear at noon when I arrived.  After some
frantic scrambling, the Hardkisses scraped together a medium-power single
speaker system by about 2:30, which was replaced by a decent outdoor system
at about 3:30.  By 4pm, several hundred ravers were going at it, with many
others sitting on the shady benches and the nearby grass.  Robbie Hardkiss
led off as DJ, followed by Spun, Moonpup, Jeno, and Robbie finished the
day at about 7:30.  As so often happens these days, Jeno played the
Ultraviolet Catastrophe record (available in stores "real soon now", I 
hear  ;^)

This weekend seems to have been our coming-of-age, at least as far as the
organizer community is concerned, between our role in pulling off the FMR
and the charity rave.  Not only were we key in collecting the proceeds,
and put up more than our share of the upfront funds (refundable out of
one of our personal pockets), but we were also responsible for connecting
with what turned out to be major beneficiary.  Hats off to all who helped
out and/or showed up!

Word is going around that there will be a front page article in next
Sunday's Examiner/Chronicle about rave, that will focus on this event,
and will probably mention SFR as well.

All in all, not bad for a rave that didn't even have a name!

P.S.  Was there really no traffic between Brian's post about the FMR
Saturday morning, and now?

P.P.S.  Why is it that raves that are scheduled to start at noon end up
starting at 3pm?   Daylight Raving Time!

 Whew! Took me a night's worth of sleep before I could post anything about
this one! There's nothing much I can add to the post by MykL G. If we get any
media coverage at all ( including the SF Chronicle ) , it should be positive,
or at least not hostile. By the way, did any TV reporters show up?

 Personal Impressions:

 It occurred to me on Sat. morning that I had never brought a camera to a rave
before - of course, the average lighting conditions at a rave don't allow for
natural light photography, which I prefer if people are involved ( although I
could time flash-lit shots with the strobes :-) ). 

 So, I brought my camera with me, on a round-about path to Golden Gate Park via
Hw 17 to Santa Cruz, then Bonny Doon Beach, then north to San Francisco. I got
to Bonny Doon at about 9:50AM - they were still playing some house music, but
no turntables in sight. About 30 to 40 people scattered nearby and about the
beach, some probably just there for the sun & sand. After doing a circuit of 
the beach to look for any SFRavers, I climbed back up to my truck and drove to
SF. I managed to find a nice parking place within reasonable walking distance
of the rave site.

 I got there just before the turntables were moved to the shade of the tree
next to the drinking fountain. I got worried about the cables running from the
mixing setup to the stage, so I did some guard duty over them, until the 
other sound system , with longer cables, was brought in.

 I hope I didn't annoy any SFRavers with my picture taking. I thought it 
would be great to have pictures of you folks, when I'm in the old folks home
many years from now. Also, a few photos to show folks what happens at raves.
I was tempted to take a picture of the guy who wanted to sell me some E, but
there's no use adding to the level of paranoia in everyday life.

 Lottsa fun watching tourists, skaters, and other non-raver park goers check
out our event. There were three grey haired used-to-be-or-maybe-still-are-
-hippies looking gals who were smiling and laughing as they watched. I invited
them to dance - "There's no age restriction, you know!".  They laughed at that
too, but I don't know if they decided to join us. Other bystanders did join
in the dance, if only for awhile.

 Very good atmosphere, both weather-wise and emotionally. I never thought how
friendly the cooler conditions in San Francisco are to dancing until now. 
The crowd was in a great mood too - how many people were dancing at and in
front of the stage, about 100? And there were scattered groups of people 
sitting on the benches and on the grass, numbering around 200. 

---------------------------------- 
 
 Hello to Suzy, Craig, and any of the new net folks I met there. I hope to have
a developed set of photos to bring to the South Bay picnic at Greer Park - you
folks can help me identify which DJ is which!

	I think it's a real shame that Richard Sun lost money on
	IMagiNation.  It was a terrific show, with some of the
	best DJs, visuals, space, etc.  Richard put a lot of work
	into this and the place was nearly packed and yet they still	
	lost money.  The explanation:  there were too many people
	on the "crew" list. 

	This is ridiculous, folks. It's one thing to get in free
	to a rave when you're setting up significant equipment, working
	security/safety, etc. and something entirely different to get
	in free because you're a friend of a friend of a friend who
	*might* bring some gear.

	Richard was asking for $10 at the door, which was a perfectly
	reasonable for a 9 hour rave, especially with the fantastic 
	setup he had. 

	The real tragedy of this is that there probably won't be a
	rave as good as IMagiNation in the SF bay area in the near future.
	And if there is, you can bet it'll cost a lot more.

	In full agreement here.  You often wonder why you hear about big
raves with thousands of people, supposedly all paying $20 to get in, and the
promoters complaining because they're losing money.  I don't know of any 
promoter here in SF who's rolling in money, and yet you'd think that any
organization that grosses twenty grand every few weeks would have a few
wealthy people.  The reason is:  most promoters _aren't_ business people.
Many try to be, and the few who are reasonably successful try to be as
businesslike as possible, but many simply have no concept of money.  They
don't realize that putting 50 people on the guest list means $1000 out of 
their pocket.  They don't realize that getting insurance for a site and getting
the proper (and usually not too expensive) permits for a site is far cheaper
than getting busted and losing the revenue.  I mean, it would have been
impossible for me to break anywhere near even if SFRavers had been told they 
didn't have to worry about contributing at Connection (the rave we threw).
I had no problem asking my best friends for money (and they, in turn, really
had no qualms about giving.)

	Raves shouldn't have to cost more than $10, no matter what.  If you
know what you're doing, and you don't get allured by the almighty dollar,
then you'll be able to throw a great party.  

	The flip side of the issue, of course, are the people who expect to
be able to get into a club for free "because they know people".  This has 
_always_ annoyed me.  If the event you are throwing is fun, people should
have no problem in paying the amount, or in helping set up/tear down/provide
security and logistics, etc.  By catering to those people you simply feed
their greed, to the point where they _won't_ come if you don't let them in
for free.  This becomes a problem if those people are your "hardcore" crowd,
who you want in there anyways to enliven the party.  So basically, don't do
it from the start.

	This weekend we held a rave in Golden Gate Park - it was a combination
of about 12 promoter groups, all of whom contributed $50 to get the permits
needed for the site.  It would have been impossible for us to charge admission
since it was a public site and open on all sides.  So instead, myself, about
5 other SFRavers, and a few of the promoters went around all afternoon asking
people to help contribute. (The charities were the Rainforest Action Network,
and the Burt Center for Abused and Battered Children).  We collected $1470 for
the charities, from about 400-500 people gathered at the site (and some of the
biggest contributors didn't even know anything about raves, but wanted to 
help anyways 'coz they liked the idea.)  I think the main selling point in
all this:  those of us organizing it weren't doing it to line our pocketbooks,
and the people there picked up on this.

	So what is the answer, In My Humble Opinion?  Rave promoters shouldn't
throw parties for profit.  I'm going to get a lot of flames for this, but hear
me out:

	First off, it doesn't take TOO much effort to throw an event, if you
know how to coordinate things and have a strong core of people willing to help
(who also aren't into it for the money).  You should be able to do it and hold
a 9-5 M-F job (with the provision that you can get a day or two off every now
and then - computer science is ideal for this!!! :)  

	Two, people are much more willing to work with you and trust you if
they know that you aren't into it for the money, and if you are willing to
open your accounting books for them.

	Three, there are things you _must_ pay:

	  1) of course, anything that has a price set: video equipment rental,
sound system, site, etc.

	  2) people who provide some of these services for a living: such as
lighting guys, DJ's etc.  Hey, I know as much as the next person that these
guys/gals gotta eat and pay for their equipment.   
	    2.1: If you tell them that you're thowing the event as a free or
ultra-low-cost affair, they'll be more willing to work for less, or maybe
even free.  Most of the starting DJ's and small lighting groups know that
their main point in playing should first be to make a name, and then to get
paid.  Tell them you'll pay them whatever you make after expenses.  Even the
best DJ's here in SF will DJ for free for the right events (the GG Park
thing, a Full Moon Rave, Sunday-afternoon-on-the-beach events, etc.)

	Four:  it's next to impossible to make as much money as a promoter
as you would make doing a "real" job,  without hurting the scene itself.  
We've all heard about the big huge raves-to-end-all-raves that LA sees often
and that have been creeping into SF as well (and in other cities, from what
I can tell).  If the promoter's interested in money, he's not going to worry
about such things as having a couple of EMT's around in case someone needs
help, or in having enough toilets, or in providing more than the bare minimum
of lighting he can get away with, or... or... his main concern is in getting
thousands of people in there, paying, buying drinks, etc.  I mean, if its his
livelihood, then its understandable. But when its our $20, then, well...
If the promoters are interested in profit, you get ToonTown, which has been
much maligned on the SFRaves list.  

	Conclusion: the promoters should do it as a hobby, nothing more.
They should do it for the thrill of having 1000 people all moving to the
same beat and loving the experience, not because 1000 people are each paying
$20 and that means you'll be able to make that downpayment on that Porsche
you've been eyeing.  Every event that I've ever thrown or helped throw has
been non-profit.  I only broke even on the first because people from the 
SFRaves helped, even weeks after the event.  And even if I hadn't broken
event, I wouldn't have minded losing $100 or $200 if that meant I could
throw a great event.  As for the DJ's, I think they should do it as a hobby
too, but I know that buying the music is VERY expensive for the DJ's who
need the new stuff every week, so I think paying them 200-300 for an event 
is entirely reasonable.  Paying them sufficiently for official events will
make them more willing to DJ for you if you want to have an afternoon beach
rave for free.

First one we didn't say anything.  Second we said 21 and over and we lost a

the 21 and over crowd.  Now we're back to not stating an age.  For the most

What a wonderful weekend it was, even the weather was excellent.  ImagiNation 
was a good starting point.  I loved all the visuals, and I'm sad the promoter
lost money.  Oh well, there was a very similar rave called Delirium Incident
about half a year ago, also on a Thursday night, in the same space, with all
kinds of visuals as well - which I heard also lost money - a lot of it.

Saturday was a beautiful day.  The rave in the park was relaxing and filled
with nice folks.  I saw Neils and Brian B. and Mykl and a few other sfravers, 
Hi!  This rave reminded me of the first rave that was held in the park before
it was eventually moved to Marx field and then elsewhere.  After the music was
shut off at 7pm, a bunch of people on bongo drums and other percusion 
instruments kept the beat going for a while - it was lovely.

Saturday night, we went to Oakland to that rave with Goa Gil & others playing,
but it was busted in the very beginning.  It was located in a run-down 
residential neighborhood.  So I went home and slept.  Now I can't remember if 
I did that on Saturday eve or Friday eve......

Sunday early afternoon, I went to the Endup but I couldn't take it for more 
than 10 min. because I felt a high level of negative energy in the air there.  
Every time I go there on a Sunday morn, I feel more negative energy flowing 
there than the previous time - maybe it's just my perceptions I don't know.
But it ain't the same atmosphere it used to be in the early part of this 
year.  I left that place in a hurry, and went home, hooked up with some 
neighbor ravers and went off to the rave in the Marin headlands for a back to
nature - back to the basics type of rave that was beautiful.  The whole 
time I was 
there, hardly anyone was dancing, and it seemed like there were only about
50 people but it was nice.  People were just chilling in the sun.  A modern 
rock 
band played live and someone tried to get all the chilling people to watch 
this band.  Before that, people were just sitting around on the blankets, 
enjoying the sun, the view, the music, and talking to eachother.  I saw a 
few sfravers there as well:  Neils, Giamma, Phoebe, Mykl and others.
I left at about 8pm to feed my starving body with the intention
of returning but I never made it back.  To anyone else who stayed past 8pm 
how did it turn out?

first off, if the /chronicle/ mentions sfr, do you think it
may get a bit out of hand in here?  i mean, we had that big
scare of about the possibility of pigs on the net, over the
busting of a mountain home rave party...
but should we get paranoid?  

as far as imagination goes, i agree with todd and brian.  i 
personally made and extra trip to sf that day in a rental
truck, at 39 cents per mile, to carry gear for weird blinking
lights, and we only got paid 40 bucks for the gig, of which i 
got 20.  unfortuneatly, the mileage racked up to about 75 bucks
for that trip.  so i lost money too.  

however, i had a *great* time, working and playing, as the event
was *very* well put together.  i think richard was incredibly cool
giving us money at all; i think some of the sleazyer promoters would
shaft the people that s/he could to keep losses to a minimum.  
richard made an effort to give us something for our time, and if there
was no stupid rental truck (as will be the case forever now) that 
would have paid for gas and coffee and donuts for the whole team.  
the team was cool in giving me half too.  i was stoked in the end
to get anything, since we're usually the last and lowest ones at 
a rave to get paid.  i guess he liked our work at interzone.  i
liked it.

something that i saw last nite that looked really good
was one of those deals with about 8 lights on them
and they spin around adn you can set the lights
anywhere in a 90 degree range..
it was sitting under a tree in a park and looked totally awesome
i think something like that could be just made out of 
lights and a spinning tray with a little work
might not be as good looking, but the effect would probably be nice

plus the fool moon added this great light effect. the muzack was really
good, ambient , not too intense. the atmosphere was good, friendly. i had
 a wonderful time. the best thing was watching the sun rise above the cliff
with the moon lighting the water. i left around 7 am and barely

i agree almost completely... it does depend on your money situation
and you cant do it every weekend or even every other weekend like
most promoters do, but it can be done.

yeah, most people, ESPECIALLY DJ's, who are into the scene in an 
active way (ie DJ's, vendors, people who are staff at raves)
are into because they want people to have a good time
if they know that you want to cut costs so that more people
can have a good time or do it as a benefit,
they are very likely to be willing not to get paid as much
or at all

 > 	Conclusion: the promoters should do it as a hobby, nothing more.

well.. this isnt a flame, but i do disagree here

although it is possible to throw a rave every once in a while
as a hobby, and in LA there are probably enough promoters
to have one thing going every weekend if they did it like this
it would mean having only one or two things the whole weekend
and there are too many people in LA to do this

recently i have been hanging around a lot of the promoters
and DJ's and everyone in the San DIego scene
from my view point, it just seems like they want to throw parties
to do this, DJ's need to have music, there needs to be a sound system
they like lights and visuals and whatever else 
(people manning the doors, selling tickets, etc etc)
and they basically do that for a living or as a side job or what not
and they invite their friends and their friends pay them money
cuz they went through all the trouble of having the party
and everyone seems happy
it was really wierd being there at the end of the rave when they turned the
lights on and i knew everyone there

basically, my point is,  they spend most of their time organizing 
events and getting new music, working on new visuals or whatever
and then they get reimbursed by their friends who didnt
help in organizing the party
it makes sense, they are all 10 or 15 buck raves, the 15 ones
being pretty big and extravagant

while it might be a nice hobby, after your 20th one, you kinda
get sick of losing money on them and the time and whatever..

a lot of vendors have the same attitude, they just try to make
back money on the cost of materials and labor
i respect that and realize that paying 20 dollars for a really
nice necklace that took 3 hours to make is really a fair deal

and besides a lot of promoters/djs/light/visuals/whatever else
people do it all week long at clubs and thats just how they live
sounds cool to me

Subject: POSITIVE WEEKEND


I just wanted briefly describe what was the best rave weekend i can remember.

FMR
===
Friday I found out really late the location of the FMR (thanks Brian). I went
there and hung out by the bonfire until it started (3AM). It was a pretty
good FMR with a reasonable number of ravers but it was definely inferior to
Connection (lack of visuals and also the energy level was lower, at least mine).
I left early because I wanted to be in good shape for the Benefit Rave in the
park. A success for SFRaves because we (well mostly Brian) decided the location.

Benefit Rave
============
It was a lot of fun to go around and ask donations to all the people.
Many different kind of people (tourist, hardcore ravers, random people hunging 
out in the park). Most of the people I asked money to where either broke 
(as they said: I didn't believe 75% for them) or they didn't care about the 
charities (some where like scared by the work charity). The remaining people 
where really enthusiast. Next time we have another charity event we need to make
it more credible: we should have booth with members of the organizations
available to explain where the money are going and also big signs that will 
probably attract tourists and not-ravers.
I think we should all work to convince the promoters and the DJ's to 
organize another one (may be in a month): the all event was positive not 
just because we raise money for charity but also because the all image of 
raves and ravers was pretty positive. So even from a business point of view 
this could help the promoters to keep the scene alive and vital.
The role of SFRaves was very important and it was great to see all the 
promoters totally trusting us in collecting the money. We definely have a 
positive image that we should try to keep.

Rave in Marin
=============
Sunday I went to this party in Marin and was fun to meet new and old
SFRavers (TAXI, Phoebe, Fred, Niels, Mykl, Brian, Chris).
It was an outdoor party with very good DJ's (Robbie Hardkiss, Harry Who)
and pretty good vibes. As TAXI said it took a while before the music picked up 
people (may be ravers are shy to dance with the sun-light) but after 8PM
there was a good number of people dancing and also a significant number
of people jamming with percussions. I wish rave promoters would provide
ravers with percussions and not with stupid bouncing castles or crap like that.

It picked up alot after 8PM (IMHO), and more people started dancing! Still,
it was a pretty tiny event. I thought the crowd was really friendly -- I
think everybody there felt that others present were "friend" (or at least
friend of a friend) as opposed to "foe".

I thought the soundsystem, music & DJing were excellent. I especially liked
the DJ from London (La Paix?) 'cause he was playing alot of funky rare
groove (which has been really big in the UK in recent years). The
Hardkisses ripped it up as well.

Maybe some of these raves are "going Hollywood" -- ever noticed how many
megamillion $$ budget Hollywood movies either manage to just break even, or
lose money?

Perhaps some of the big-rave promoters are becoming savvy to such tax
scams?  Or maybe the Townsend site decided it needed to lose some money to
help keep the books balanced.

The power of appearing to lose money is a very forceful feature of our
current tax system. You're much better off making sure that you come off
with no profits whatsoever, as long as you can figure out ways to funnel
the "costs" of putting on the event back to yourself. e.g. make sure that
you buy some new equipment each time and add that to the costs of throwing
the event... or let all your friends in for free and then write off that
cost as "promotional expenses". 

Hell, the possibilities for lies, deceit and ripoffs are so immense that I
expect George Bush will be throwing raves as soon as we vote him out of the
Whitehouse. (Don't worry -- he'll funnel all the Ecstacy profits back into
CIA covert operations.)

Subject: Weekend - Review



I am still recovering from this weekend's excesses.
Skipped FMR since the drive was too long, so I went to
Higgedy Piggedy instead. Steve Pinkston told me he would be
there with AstroBoy, where were you, steve?
It was at Thunder Bay, and was a huge line outside at Midnight,
I was told that the cover was $10-12. 
There was a pond of sorts on one side on the road and the entrance
to H.P. at the end. It was cold that night.
 There was a couple security guards there minding
the line. He walked up and down making people standing in a straight
narrow line, almost single filed. At the entrance, we were told "no
backpacks, no water bottles" and everyone was searched! The cover
 was $20. It was very paranoid vibes, at that point I didn't want to
go in, but my friends talked me into it with the classic line "Come on,
we are here". Inside is this big outdoor courtyard looking like a flea market,
with T shirts, necklaces, candy etc for sale at different stalls, and
there is a dj with small setup there, and a few people were dancing.
Indoor are 3 rooms, the dance floor was packed and *very loud*,
the bar takes up most of the next room and also sells water for 25 cents,
the last room has a small platform for sitting and hanging out and
a couple stalls selling aloe shakes, toast with jam, and also
colored syrup with ice water marketed as smart drinks for $3.50 to $4.50:
The sign says "Smart Bar", the ingredents list fruits and everything comes
out of Italian soda syrup bottles.
One person I know got her leather jacket stolen when she put it down to dance for a min. I found out that Astroboy and everybody else (who got there a little
earlier) paid $15 to get in.
The crowd was very alcohol laden. At around 3-4 am, it got a lot better, there's
room to dance in the dance floor, people sobered up from C2H5OH.
Around 4am, we left to go in search of the 
secret-hot-spring-in-the-sand-at-low-tide in Marin. We found it, and then
hiked the beach until late morning.
  Sat was low energy, Sunday I went to Ruth's going away party in Marin
and saw Mykl, Niels, Giamma and Taxi, Nice meeting you Taxi.
I better go back to work, ciao, P.

Subject: any alt.rave readers interested in compiling interesting posts


I don't have time to read netnews recreationally (though I do read
work-related comp.* groups), so I was wondering whether any of you alt.rave
readers out there would be interested in compiling a weekly list of
articles you find interesting/informative/etc and forwarding that
compilation of articles to sfraves (perhaps once a week).

Interested? 

Or is this a stupid idea?

I saw all the fine print, and yes, it is very deceptive about what it's talking
about.  I even tried calling the phone message, but it was still cryptic.  The
main thing I'm riding on here is on the back where it says "From the creator of
Trilogy, the documentary event of Los Angeles raves, now bring you the
documentary event of San Fransisco."  I remember a set of three raves down
there called "Trilogy", the first of which happened just before I left (and
which got busted while I was en route from the map point, having already paid
my $20 %(  ), so... I guess it's all how we interpret the term "documentary
event".  There are enough clues on the flyer to suggest both possibilities...
like why would there be intellebeams at a movie??? Hrmm....

Well, maybe it's both. :)  Maybe they'll show the rave at some big drive-in,
and then dance from then until sunup.  Sounds good, actually.

Subject: SF Net

  I may be too late to catch anyone's attention about SF Net.  But I do want to
put in a good word for them.  Wayne Gregori, the Sysop, works very hard to
maintain a truly innovative BBS. Installing and maintaining those cafe computersis a *major* undertaking.  He does it, i think, largely because he has the same
feelings about community that most SFRavers do. many of the SF Net folks, thoughare too poor to afford home modem set-ups, and/or can't get them at their schools.  So they feed quarters into the machines to talk with other people and post
messages. The chat lines do lapse into inane blather sometimes; but at others
they serve as real outlets for people who have no friend close by to talk with.
The posts on SF Net are generally quite good -- often better than what I see
in the alt. or rec. groups on Newsnet. 
  Bottom line: I think that some of the SF Netters would get a lot our of
SF Raves. Better to welcome them than hang out an "Exclusive" Members Only!"
sign.

	Hopefully my last word on this. I believe Brian's decision should 
prevail as there seemed to be a fair amount of pro sentiment as well as con.
On the pro side it opens this mailing list up to ravers who could only access
via a public terminal or who did not have a path to soda.  Some of my doubts 
of anonymous access were addressed by Wayne signing accounts up. I thought
someone could walk up to a terminal, create a handle, send a request to 
Soda, and read our mail.  It's the public terminal that still bother me, as I 
typically see several people gathered around one, and am unsure some of us 
would want the contents of our mail sitting around on an electronic tabletop 
in some cafe, with iced espresso spilled on it, (although some might like 
this).

You need security to make sure that people are taken care of. Especially if they are tripping.  Security should be the people who deal with the police if need be and basically make the rave "secure" and safe.  I feel better at places
like bonny dune If I know that there is someone around who is an EMT or just
knows CPR.  If something bad happens we can't just rely on "Oh um. well I donna know" when someone's life is at stake.

This is a good point... 'security' at events like raves or large parties are
really just people controlling the buffer between what's going on inside the 
event and the outside world.  I mean jeez, it's not like they are defending the
president from assasins or anything.  One party I was at in college had 
the 'security' for the most part just keeping wasted people from staggering
off into a ravine [about as treacherous as the entrance to connection :) ].

  I don't want this to sound negative, and I want to get away from the
SF Net Discussion, but I don't understand why people think that a
mailing list is any more private than a newsgroup.  I suppose it's in
the way people think of things.  The only real difference is that a
list is only getting sent to the readers rather than the whole world
(who may not necessarily read it).
  I think that when I send this message, I'm posting it to a
newsgroup.  I don't consider my messages private any more than posting
on an average size BBS which would have about the same number of
people reading it.  People may gather around somebody's terminal to
read alt.rave now for all I know.  Or someone may be printing out a
digest and pass it around to all their raving friends (If there really
is that much more signal than noise here :)

  On another subject, I've noticed that the traditional non-alcoholic
rave custom and culture has been embracing alcohol more and more at
events recently.  I don't mean to say that drinking alcoholic beverages
is bad in itself, but I always thought that raves were sort of founded
in an atmosphere that included getting away from the stigma of what
alcohol at a club or a party means.  And I appreciate that alcohol
free environment.
  Perhaps the logistics getting or allowing alcohol at raves past was
just too much and that was the actual reason for the lack of it
(though I think not).  
  Maybe the movement of raves into the club scene (which was bound to
happen), where the clubs basically make most of their revenue in
alcohol sales, is bringing alcohol in to the rave scene.
  Or is the reason for the change that American social culture is so
attached to alcohol that it was bound to make its way into rave
culture as it grew.  I can hardly remember a private social party that
didn't have alcohol.  Even private rave parties seem to be serving
alcohol.

  Most of the small raves still don't serve alcohol.  But would they
if they could?  I think that the rave scene is better without it.  If
I wanted to go drink, I would go to a bar or a club (maybe on rave
night), but not a rave--it's not a part of the scene.  
  Is it just me?

      Still, it was one happy    
      Indian dude behind the    
      cash register, looking    
      at everyone buying        
      stuff.                    
                                
                    


Talked with some guys in the parking
lot, locals getting off work, they'd
found the bus making a supermarket
stop, and picked up on the energy of
the bus riders.  They'd heard that it
was going to be $15 at the door.     
                    
          It was $20.  
                       
               This was really annoying, but
               We Were There Already, so... 
                                            
                                                                              
                  And from the desk you could see
                  the bright green Argon laser   
                  flashing through the dust and  
                  smoke, behind a long row of    
                  silhouetted pillars.  Shadowy                  
                  figures were moving around in a                 
                  space literally the size of a                       
                  few football fields.                                
                                                                  
                                                 
We bought tickets. Then I                        
noticed the no in-and-outs rule.                 
                                                 
I tried to ask a security guard if               
they'd mind if I brought in some                 
water bottles.  He immediately                   
assumed I was asking if I could go               
out some time later to get them.                 
And in general he acted like a           I worked out a way to smuggle in

would have left right then.                                               
                                     


Later, inside one of the 
porta-cans, by the light 
of my flash light, I 
found a little wad of         You can take this as my 
cash lying on the floor.      life in microcosm: 
Enough to pay for the 
evening.                      To find this money, you needed to 
                              be anal retentive enough to 
                              carry a flashlight around with 
                              you, but not too anal retentive 
                              to pick something up off of a 
                              rather slimy, grimy floor. 
                                                            
                                    Like a friend said to me
                                    once: "You seem like a 
                                    weird mixture of laid-   And maybe I'm    
                                    back and compulsive."    also a mix of    
                                                             "cynical and     
                                                             idealistic". 



Overall my friend was much impressed:
"This looks like a scene from Blade  
Runner, except we're *here* we're    
walking around in it."               
                                   
                             
He was also much impressed by
the money involved.  You could
practically hear the sound of a
cash register, and see the
dollar signs lighting up his
eyes:                
                     
    At least two thousand people,
    at $20 each, that's a gate      
    value of at least $40,000.   
    He came up with a high       
    estimate of the costs to the    
    promoter of around $12K.                 I tried to argue that 
    $28K in profit, in one night?            he must be underestimating
                                             the costs, probably by 
                                             a factor of two or so, 
                                             as people often do.   

Later, he talked about this with             Could there be considerations

   So what's going on here?

   Are the major promoters                     
   price-fixing somehow?

Out on the dance floor, Vitamin B   
found me, and said something     
about how he was afraid this     
might have been like a big LA    
rave, but it was a lot better,   
the people were great, like if   
you touch them and it was all    
right... you know?               
                                 
I said sure, but I hadn't known it     
until he said it.  At that moment,     
I realized I was still warming up,               
I hadn't quite blended into the                   An uptightness example:

disappeared instantly.                            was shirtless but       
                                                  still dripping with     
                                                  sweat.  One of the      
                                                  women working there     
                                                  put her arm around me   
                                                  and hugged me.  So, I   
                                                  start thinking things   
                                                  like "does she want     
                                                  to sleep with me, or    
                                                  is she hustling for     
                                                  tips or what?"          
                                                                          
                                                  At a rave there wouldn't
                                                  be that sense about it. 
                                                  She just hugged me,     
                                                  that's all.             
      
      
  I said hello to some other   
  sfravers, and I wound up     
  over in front of the left         Compulsive: I've always     
  speaker column.  Time to put      got a handful of disposable 
  my ear plugs in.                  ear plugs in my jacket.     
                                    Still more compulsive:      
                                    I've almost always got      
                                    my jacket with me, no matter
                                    how hot or awkward it is.   
                               

Dancing in front of the speakers                                          
was an experience in itself.                                              
Moving your head completely 
changed the sound.                   
                            Up is treble down is bass... 
                            Dancing where your physical
                            attitude controls what you 
   With my head right       hear...                     
   down in front of                                     
   the woofers, it                I can imagine a literal            
   was easy to hear a             "sonic space", sound               
   buzzing distortion             beamed in different

         So yeah,                 it would provide the               
         the                      only modulation for the

Other people were crowded

feeling the vibrations on                                            
her body, while a guy                                                 
friend caressed her from                                             
behind.                                                              
 
                   Interesting people there all
                   right... could it be I'm one
                   of them?  Maybe not: they   
                   were all without ear plugs...         
                                                         


I was getting tired of the weight of
a can of jolt cola banging on my    
hip.  My friend didn't want any, so 
I went over to the the next circle  
of people in the "chill" region.    
                                    
I started talking to the guys,      
rather then the girls to diffuse any                                   
anti-pick-up paranoia.  "Do you                                        
want some of this?"  I said, and                                       
opened it in front of them so they            (Just bringing something  
could see that it had been sealed.            to give away is such an   
The guys turned me down, but the              easy thing to do, but    
girls on my left took it from me.             people are so impressed  
And one of them says "Can I ask you           by it... "Thanks a lot,  
something? Is there any acid in               that was really cool...")
this?"                                        
                                    
Later on, a tall, pretty, dark-skinned
girl wearing a silver back-pack came  
by and smiled at me again, and        
offered me a drink of her Cranberry   
juice.  I said "Is this straight?"    
as I took a sip.  It took her a       
moment to figure out what I was       
asking, but then she was emphatic     
"No, no, there's nothing funny in it!"
                                      
           Maybe there's more drug paranoia
           than drugs around.                                
                                           
                                           
                                           
Not far from the speaker column, 
a woman started doing things          
like clearing a space in the          
crowd, and getting people to           I've got no problem with     
play catch with a couple of            silly ice-breaking games,    
water bottles with glow-toys           and I'm a great joiner-inner,
inside them.                           so I start playing along.    
                                 
Just as we were getting into   
playing catch, then she        
suddenly decides that that's           So I could see that she could

them toward a different game.                             
                                                          
Some guys near by were dancing                            
with women on their shoulders.                            
I could've tried talking this             I don't know why I didn't

features -- trust, physical               felt intimated by The Queen,   
contact -- but I much prefer it           and I knew it wasn't my place  
to the strangulation ritual.              to give her orders.            
                                                                         
                                                                         


                               
                          All in all this was an interesting rave...

How about having one at some big drive-in, movie or not?  It would
be a good way for a drive-in owner to make a little money on a

I don't have too much to add to the reports on Townsend's IMAGINATION or
the GG Park Charity thing.  Both were very enjoyable.  As far as
IMAGINATION losing money goes, I have to disagree with whoever said
that it was packed.  It never really got crowded at all.  There was hardly
anyone around to see the three live techno bands, and there was plenty of
room to dance freely or chill out.  I think some of the hype scared away
a lot of hardcore ravers.  In fact, I'm not sure I'd even call IMAGINATION
a pure rave.  It was a technoritualconsciousnessexpanding happenning that
went a bit further that the standard trancedancelightshowchillout event.
Did anyone ever find out what all the ritualistic fire & brimstone on the 
upstairs of the main room was all about?  Anyway, it's too bad IMAGINATION
wasn't a bigger financial success as I would definately like to see more
of the same.

So did anyone else go to Basics at The Stone Sat. nite?  Talk about packed!
Wall to wall people, very intense energy level, great hard techno music.
Me and 2 friends found one spot by the railing next to the dance floor
and danced there for 5.5 nonstop hours.  It was very hot, but my only complaint
was the lack of lighting.  I thought $15 was high, but they were selling 
nice sized juice drinks for $1.

Anyway, it looks like I overdid it a bit this weekend and have come down
with a cold.  It was well worth it.  I`ll *probably* skip a week to be 
functional for Alternity.

YOWZA -- this sounds really cool, especially because I'll be in Hawaii at
that time for "work". Any other SFRAVERs interested in pooling resources
for this rave (e.g. sharing accomodations, rental cars, etc?).

PLEASE PLEASE post or mail mayer@hplabs.hp.com && prichard@well.sf.ca.us
any info you get on this event....

PS: For you computer geekoids out there, note that the HICSS-26 Conference
(Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences) is happening at the
Stouffer Waiohai Beach Resort, Poipu Beach, Kauai, Jan 5-8 1993.

PPS: When I was in Hawaii last March, I went to this club called "The Wave"
in Honolulu and they were playing pretty decent industrial/techno/dance at
3AM...  There were lots of dark-skinned local females wearing pancake
makeup, dressed in black, and acting like the deathroque pixies you'd find
back at the old Lipps/Underground.... This provided excellent cognitive
dissonance given that I was in the land of sunshine, bronzed skin, flowery
dresses, and Hawaiian shirts....

This is a good place for a rave.  One side is right next to the bay, the other
is surrounded by the freeway, and the rest is surrounded by warehouses.  The 
only houses there are on the opposite side of the freeway.
It also has built-in speakers. :)

Techniques" where they mention "the use of generators as a source of power
will also be examined"....

In addition to lots of academic/erudite presentations on things like
"Binaural Auralization: Head-Related Transfer Functions Measured on Human
Subjects" there are some cool/interesting tours that will make all ye
tech-heads go "oooooh":
	* Silicon Graphics -- digital recording and midi
	* Dolby Laboratories...
	* Fantasy Studios and Saul Zaentz Co Film Center
	* Ultrasound (the concert sound company used by the grateful dead)
	* Center for New Music and Audio Technologies @ Berkeley.

Advance registration (deadline Sept 17!) for non-memebers is $220.00,
students w/ ID -- $65.00, ($75 at the door).  Prices for exhibits only (see
lots of cool audio gear) is $25.00; $35.00 at the door.

The Audio Engineering Society, Inc. will FAX you registration materials and
an advance program by contacting them
	tel: (212)661-8528
	fax: (212)682-0477

I'm really looking forward to this conference (it'll be my first AES conf).

  I think there's an out-of-use drive in right on the border of Marin and sonomacounties, just off Highway 101. Since it's last incarnation was a big-screen
porn theater, maybe the neighbors would regard a rave as a definite step up
in the quality of performances held there.
  But then again, maybe not....
  Anyway, the location is worth looking into.

for that total-surround-sound effect?  And the building in the middle of it
all to sell popcorn and drinks, just waiting for a smart bar? And on and on...

There was this one movie "the scene" about the LA pre-rave scene
(90-91) with a lot (if not all) of the LA Dj's listed above in it.`

Maybe this is "the scene ii".  Sounds cool though, they could prob
make lots of money if they put it out on vhs for $75 or something :-)

Yeah, I went.  It was so hot in there I ended spending 80% of the time in the
alley on the side of the building.  I was pretty pissed that there were no in's
and out's.  I don't think I'll ever go to a rave at the Stone again.  The crowd
didn't thin out to a reasonably sparse density until after 5 am.  The music,
however, was fantastic.  The set that Garth played from 5 to 7 or so was the 
best I've heard from him in quite a while.

The only sfravers that I recognized were Pete Reiter and Dan and Rox.  I guess
the GG park thing wore out everyone else.

My theory is that Alcohol just doesn't mix well with the other preferred
substances, so the promoters don't go out of their way to sell it.  E and
booze seem to cancel each other out, or at least the booze lessens the Effect. 
Never tried booze and acid, but I imagine it would not be the optimal
concoction.  I used to wonder why people waited so late to take their E, like
at 2:30.  I think one of the reasons is that the bars are open again by the
time you're comin' down if you take it late.  Coming down from E into a nice
alcoholic buzz transfers the positive energies into that fuzzy funny buzzed
state, rather than down into the not-so-uncommon down doldrums.  Or so I'm
told.  :-)

Here, here.  My node doesn't get alt.raves.  I'd probably make the time for it,
but, alas, the point is moot.  I'd even *pay* for this service.  Well, not
much, but I'd say "thank you" a lot.

P. Couch pipes:
>(Higgledy Piggledy) was at Thunder Bay...

Really?  Up until very recently, Friday nights at Thunder Bay was a rather lame
18+ gay dance club called the Mix.  Were there any signs of the Mix?  I'm not
surprised it was lame, given the other types of events that they've held there
in the past.  Saturdays at this locale is the Dance Factory, put on by Page
Hodel of The Box.  Her music selection has been getting better over the past
year -- she's playing a lot more house, instead of hip hop and funk which she
used to play almost exclusively.

	Aaah... remember a time a month or so ago when I asked you all to
fill out a little questionnaire?  Well, things finally quieted down enough

This is basically a summary of the responses.  I have compiled everyone's
reply to each question in a file that will be in the soda archives (under

question, but I did collect everyone's replies in that file.  What follows

I'm making the compilation file available as any good researcher would make
his original data available, but of course without any attribution to preserve

God I hope not.

        Hmmm... good question.  I'm not sure quite what I think on this one.
I think the spirit/vibes/whatever is similar (although I can only know
second-hand with regard to the 60's), and that's probably more relevant
than any superficial resemblance or causal relationship between the two.
Would the rave scene have happened without the precedents of the 60's?
Well, I can't even really answer my own question, but I'd like to think so.
Although the 60's scene probably made it easier for like-spirited scenes
to come about again.

no (there are common attributes, but i think the primary ideals of
each "movement" are different)

There is definitely a connection.

I think that anything that happened after
that scene was influenced by it. The rave scene has its more obvious traits
in common with the hippy scene, but it is not the same exact thing happening
at a latter time period.

Hell no! I see raves as a reaction to the lameness of American suburbia.
Boring. And in the US you can't drink 'til you are old enough to know not to.
so fuck it! We reject alcohol and the clubs everyone has "fun" at.
It seems to me like hippies emerged from similar boredom with "Leave it to
Beaver" but had a very strong political component attached which we ravers
lack.

Raves are definitely part of a continuing scene for me;
the trips festivals of 30 years ago started it for me, but
in a larger context they are a continuation of the
Mediterranean trancedance music of the
past thousands of years, i.e., pipes of pan, Moroccan jujka, etc.

Not really. The focus is in the music and dance, there's no speech making or
  rallying around the causes that would have been a part of 60's gatherings.
  But, there's no denying the "gathering of the tribe" aspect, I think it's
  a descendant of a more primitive need for social gatherings with music and da
ncing.

There are some frightening Parallels

Yes, but Only in S.F.

Is it a 60's decendant..? I like something recently heard..history doesnt
repeat..it rhymes!

Always a bit cynical, here are some concerns about a Drive-In rave:

- You could have a HUGE crowd there and they are pretty well enclosed.  
  Whoever thought of this idea is a god, this is a great place, and there
  are more than a handful of places around here that are either out of
  business or would be willing to give it up for even (gasp) a weekend night
  for the right amount of money.

- I used to live near an old drive-in and we used to run around there when I
  was young.  Those screens are REALLY big.  You would have to have projectors
  right near by in order to make them even visible.  I wouldn't count on being
  able to use any of the professional display equipment owned by the theater,
  from what I understand the bulbs are really expensive and tempermental.

- The surface is usually gravel at these places, to "absorb" the oil and
  whatnot that leaks out of cars.

- You would have to have a "foot patrol" that would watch the walls, as you
  would get a lot of people leaping the walls to save $5 or $10 cover.

- You could do some REALLY cool stuff with lasers and smoke with that much
  space...!

- You might be better off cutting the whole area by about 1/3 and having
  people in just the front most area, near the screen.  You could use the
  rest for parking, as there may be a good chance you will not be able to
  park too many cars legally beyond the theater area.


I'd be more than interested in taking a pretty pro-active part of getting
something like this together if other SFRavers are hot to do this!

Not "stupid" at all, however, I find that alt.rave takes less time
to peruse in general than does the mail from sfraves. Besides, you'd
have to entrust someone to arbite what was "informative"...

Yeah, this can get pretty annoying.  My general mode of operation these days is
to avoid any clubs with "no ins and outs" rules.  It's very aggravating.  I
wound up listening to Green Day from outside at Berkeley Square.  Better that
than give them $7 to stand in a totally packed sweaty club barely able to move
and totally unable to sit.

What does this have to do with Raves?  Not much other than if they are held
at clubs ins and outs should be allowed.  And definitely at Alternity.  I need
my fresh air!  :)

Take Care...

I highly recommend subscribing to:

	and 

	alt.fan.ren-and-stimpy

Alt.psychoactives is great. If you take an interest in something ask
for a FAQ.  You will be surprised how may psychoactives are discussed
on that group, and how much detail you can get on a question. Tripping
is not for everyone, but those who it is for this can be a valuble
resource. You may develop an active interest in organic chemistry!

For my money sfraves is by far the coolest post.

Sounds about right. It's right by Red Rock and takes some rock scrambling
to get there. Yes it is a nudist hangout.
How about a nude rave - stark raving ? (just kidding)

Subject:      techno music / call for papers
To: Multiple recipients of list TNC <TNC@GITVM1.BITNET>

I'm new to this list, but have been reading up on the archives, and
it looks great.I teach postmodern theory and medieval lit at Colby
College in Maine, and am also a sci-fi and electronic music collector.
I'm particularly interested in the new techno/rave music, which is
actualy not all that new (the Detroit group Cybotron pioneered the
genre back in '83 with cuts like R-9 and Clear (available on Rhino
Records' Electric Funk samplers)) but has finally reached the point
where mass media outlets like TIME, SPIN (sept. 92), and Entertain-
ment Weekly have deemed it worth of attention.  Exported to Britain,
techno-rave/acid house has instigated a social mobilization of strange
proportions: the music -- which typically takes 1 or more 'found' sounds
(a clip of a Reagan speech, an Annie Lennox vocal, some grinding metal
a la Einsturzende Neubaten) and combines them with a high-bpm (beats
per minute) rhythm track -- is commonly produced at home by young kids
with cheap high-tech (Moby's remix of the Twin Peaks theme was done
this way, and today Michael Jackson is having Moby cut-and-paste his
latest cuts in search of a dance club hit).  The songs, in turn, are
played at warehouse 'house' parties -- illicit, fly-by-night parties
typically advertized with a phone # on a slip of xerox paper (though
I've seem some on the computer nets too), where light shows, mood
elevating drugs, and nonstop techno beats are the rule.  It's a sort
of apotheosis of post-Industrial rustbelt tech, a nomadic spectacle
on the edge of the burned-out unreal cities of the 90's -- and I'm
wondering if anyone out in the vectors of TechNoCulture has been
listening too . . .

I also have a call for papers, which in some ways overlaps with this
interest (laredy posted to PMC, but I thought I might reach still
more via TNC):



===============================================================
^WITHOUT ANY RULES: The POLITICS AND POETICS OF THE VERNACULAR^

We are seeking original, article-length essays on vernacular art-
forms in a postcolonial/postmodern context, including music, oral
poetry, post-colonial writing/criticism, vernacular festivals or
other practices, vernacular architecture, film, video, or other
appropriations of space/language/technology.  Some examples might
be: hip-hop music, graffiti, raves, dance parties, blues, jazz,
reggae, postcoloial fiction & poetry, home videos, sampling,
pastiche, photo-collage, xerox art.  Essays on vernacular languages
are especially sought which frame the question of the opposition
(ality) of the vernacular, as a language of resistance to hegemonic
forces.

Contributors at present include Ronald Jemal Stephens on the
vocabulary of hip-hop, and an essay on the vernacular by the
Nigerian novelist Amos Tutuola.

Abstracts, proposals, and/or papers may be sent by e-mail to

TimeBomb is the name of the current 808 State single.  Presumably the
SpinMasters (the DJ's from 808 State) will be playing it along with
whatever else they bring.

I'm going to be at this one.  I know where it is but I'm not sure if I
should say.  I'll tell you that it's not in the city, but it's north
of Santa Clara.  Suitably vague?  Good.  See you all there!

          THE FDA, NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND MIND MACHINES.
 
9/15/92
 
     There are four letters in this posting.  Possibly you should just
send the whole thing to your printer and then read it at your leisure,
you will want to keep the names and addresses for future reference.
 
     1.) A description of the FDA's proposed regulations as laid out by
the National Health Alliance (NHA).
     2.) A plea from the NHA that you write your congressmen.
     3.) Sample letters to handwrite to your congressmen.
     4.) A personal letter from me, if you can't stomach virulence just
skip it.
     5.) A personal letter from a friend who sells mind machines.
 
     I apologize for posting this all over the net, but sometimes you
gotta interrupt the scheduled programming with important late breaking
news.
 
     All flames to me, PLEASE DO NOT respond to the list that you read
this on.

                    THE FDA'S CAMPAIGN TO TAKE AWAY
                   YOUR FAMILY'S HEALTH CARE RIGHTS.
 
     Enclosed is information regarding the legislative action affecting
the dietary supplement industry, the natural health care community and
our right to choose wellness over illness.  The three main areas that
require attention are as follows:
 
1. The Nutrition Labeling And Education Act of 1990 2. Dietary
Supplement Task Force Report 3. The FDA Enforcement Amendments of 1991
(HR 3642 & S 2135)
 
              Nutrition Labeling And Education Act (NLEA)
 
     In an attempt to provide the American public with information
regarding the health-promoting benefits of foods, Congress enacted the
Nutrition Labeling And Education Act of 1990, instructing the FDA to
develop guidelines for how health claims can be made on food products.
FDA has proposed regulations that will do the following:
 
     Disallow health claims for fiber, anti-oxidants, unsaturated fatty
acids, zinc, etc.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                  PAGE 2
 
 
     Lower RDA's from 10%-80%, reclassifying them as RDI's (Recommended
Daily Intake).
 
     Dramatically reduce the potency of vitamins and minerals,
REGULATING HIGH POTENCY VITAMINS AS DRUGS.
 
     Eliminate supplements such as bioflavonoids, rutin, PABA, selenium,
inositol, chromium and other "nutritional substances."
 
     Eliminate herbs from the definition of "dietary supplement," thus
regulating them as drugs.
 
     Consider any educational material, whether product specific or not,
to be considered a third-party endorsement, and therefore any referral
to a book may be considered a drug claim.
 
     Restrict the use of truthful educational material in the promotion
of dietary supplements.
 
                  Dietary Supplement Task Force Report
 
     In addition to the NLEA regulations, the FDA Commissioner David
Kessler convened a Dietary Supplement Task Force to determine how
supplements could be better regulated  Preliminary discussions v.ith
members of the task force have revealed the following:
 
     Dietary Supplements will be categorized in three classes:
 
     Category 1: Potencies of multi-vitamins and multi-minerals.
Potencies of dietary supplements will be no higher than those found in
foods.
 
     Category 2: Amino Acids, with recommendations that they be changed
to prescription only.
 
     Category 3: All others will be available only by prescription,
including herbs, specialized vitamin and mineral products, etc.
 
        The FDA Enforcement Amendments of 1991 (HR 3642 & S 2135)
 
     These proposed laws are designed to provide the FDA with a
considerable amount of increased authority for taking action against
products without "due process of law." The FDA will have the ability to
embargo products, stop importation of herbs, levy fine of up to $250,000
per infraction for individuals and up to $1,000,000 per infraction for
corporations, and subpoena records without court supervision.  No other
agency has been given such broad and constitutionally questionable
powers.  The House version is sponsored by Congressmen Waxman and
Dingell, the Senate version is sponsored by Senator Kennedy.
 
     Because of the inherent bias the FDA has historically shown against
herbs and the dietary supplement industry, we have no doubt that they
will use these increased enforcement authorities to take unwarranted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                  PAGE 3
 
action.  In preparation for increased enforcement activities, the FDA
has hired 100 criminal investigators led by a 20-year veteran of the
U.S. Secret Service.

Dear Health Food Industry Member:
 
IT'S TIME TO ACT.
 
Gary Dykstra, FDA Deputy Commissioner, made the following statements at
the NNFA Show in Nashville:
 
"As most of you know already, and it's not been a well kept secret, the
Task Force is going to recommend in its report that amino acids be
regulated as drugs."
 
"With regard to taking actions against herbs as drugs or as new drugs,
we continue to do that on a case by case basis..."
 
"The Dr. Wright situation out in Seattle, I don't want to get defensive
about that.  Obviously we felt that we did the right thing."
 
The handwriting is on the wall.  The FDA intends to eliminate the
dietary supplement industry as we know it.
 
*    The NHA is moving forward rapidly.  The Hatch Bill, S 2835, is in
the Senate expecting committee consideration and the Richardson Bill, HR
5746, is progressing in the House.  It is URGENT that you support these
bills with letters and phone calls immediately.  WE ONLY HAVE FIVE WEEKS
TO ACT BEFORE THE END OF THIS SESSION OF CONGRESS.
 
*    The NHA has its own team of experienced legislative activists
working full time with our legislators in Washington.
 
*    The NHA has hired one of the top PR firms in the country, Rogers
and Cowan, to bring our message loud and clear to all concerned citizens
in the United States.
 
*    The NHA has just created a toll free legislative up-date hot line
(1 800-226-4NHA) to keep you currently informed about the Health Freedom
bills, the FDA enforcement bills, nutritional labeling issues, and other
important legislative and regulatory news.  Please call us today.  Let
us hear from you with your questions and recommendations.  WE ARE HERE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                  PAGE 4

professionals.  Most importantly, the NHA represents YOU and the 80
million Americans who enjoy the freedom of choice to take dietary
supplements.  WE NEED YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHTS AND
YOUR LIVELIHOOD.
 
IT IS TIME TO ACT.  Even if you have sent in letters in the past, for
the next five weeks send in ADDITIONAL LETTERS.  Call and visit your
senators and representatives.  Ask them to co-sponsor the Health Freedom
Bills in their house.  Motivate your customers to write letters and make
phone calls.  It may well be now or never.  Join our fax network and

          THE FDA, NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND MIND MACHINES.
 
                          Homer Wilson Smith
 
     The FDA is planning one of the scariest attacks on your personal
freedom and well being that has ever come down the pike, and the
scariest thing is, is that it will probably pass without anyone knowing
about it until it is far too late.
 
     You think the evening news has your best interests in mind?
 
     They exist on the advertising revenues for drugs and alcohol, you
ever see an ad for multi vitamins or Niacin during prime time live?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                 PAGE 6
 
     In fact, the new laws HAVE ALREADY BEEN PASSED AND ARE SOON TO GO
INTO EFFECT but if you act now, and I do mean right now, you might be
able to help countering legislation go into effect that will protect
your rights and freedoms which the FDA and the American Medical
Association and the other purveyors of drug and medicine addiction are
planning to take away from you and your children.
 
    This is all described in the preceding articles in clear detail,
and you should read every word of them, and then write and fax the hell
out of your representatives in the House and the Senate letting them
know just where you stand on the subject of your health.
 
     Put bluntly what the FDA wants to do is ban the sale of
nutritional supplements, like vitamins and herbs and amino acids,
except those that contain no more than what can be found in natural
foods.  They wish to regulate high potency vitamins, B-100's, A
10,000's, E 1000's, C 1000's, D 400's, and NIACIN 100's, etc as DRUGS,
subject to the laws governing narcotics and criminal possession
thereof.
 
     Such high potency supplements would only be available by
prescription from a doctor, that you would have to PAY to visit and get
that prescription, and you would only get it for as long as the doctor
said you could have it.
 
     If he thought some of his higher priced, medicines were more
suitable for you, well then he could take you off of A, B, C, D, E,
IODINE, NIACIN, CALCIUM and MAGNESIUM, and put you on something more
reasonable like THORAZINE, LITHIUM, VALLIUM, PROZAC, CHLORPROMAZINE and
other stuff that God meant only for monsters.
 
     All herbs would also be regulated as drugs, lest anyone get well
or stay well growing something that didn't generate a tithe to the
almighty drug companies and Eli Lily.
 
    Whatever happened to growing your health in the back yard?
Whatever happened to allopathic and homeopathic medicine, what ever
happened to traditional wisdom on the subject of health care, disease
prevention and cure?
 
     Do you REALLY think that some guy in a white coat making $150,000
a year knows more than your 90 year old grandmother about how to live
long and prosper?
 
     Or is their whole game to suppress the symptom with some crazy
drug and charge a buck for it?
 
     Have we all become computer robots so that only the assigned and
certified technicians of the body are allowed to dispense cures and
biochemical alignment and peace?
 
     Vitamins, as you all know, are not produced by the body.  Dogs for
example can produce their own vitamin C, but humans can't.  Ever try
feeding an orange to a dog?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                 PAGE 7
 
 
     Well my Joey would eat grapes...
 
     Anyhow, the B vitamins are used to catalyze the burning of ATP and
act as an important part of the energy cycle.
 
     Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant to keep everything else from turning
rancid in your body, and Vitamin C is used to help you clean out all
the toxins from your body.
 
     Smokers by the way have a much higher need of Vitamin C than non
smokers.
 
     Niacin, a B vitamin, is one of the most amazing substances known
to man, if you haven't tried it yet, GO DO IT.  If you are trying to
get off of cigarettes, niacin might help as it is related to nicotinic
acid.
 
     Niacin of course must be taken with a balance of the other
vitamins and minerals and iodine.
 
     Calcium and Magnesium are critical to the functioning of the
nervous system and the bone and teeth structure, and often a deficiency
of either will cause a person to be on edge continually.
 
     Anyhow, this whole god damn world is so polluted, the air is so
disgusting, the water so foul, and the quality of food is so depleted
and POISONED, considering how much processing it goes through to get
from there to here, that there is just no way normal doses of vitamins
are sufficient for many people to survive on this planet.
 
     One whiff of car fumes and I am dying like you wouldn't believe, I
mean it can ruin my entire day.  I used to be a heavy smoker, until I
quit, using A, B, crystal C, D, E, Iodine (from tincture), Niacin and
minerals.
 
     Gee and I though Iodine was POISONOUS!  Well don't go drinking the
entire bottle.  Just use 3 drops in orange juice with a teaspoon of
CRYSTAL C ALREADY mixed in it.  Just the reaction of the C and the
iodine is a wonder to behold, you just KNOW it's gotta be good for you.
Don't forget to take A, B, D and E along with it.
 
     Niacin in fact saved my life, along with Iodine and other
minerals.  I would be dead if it weren't for niacin.
 
     The DOCTORS wanted to cut me open and do surgery on my spine!
That would take care of the pain they said.  Right.
 
     Now there is another aspect to this, and that is mind machines and
bio feedback devices.  Again the AMA doesn't want anything to make you
well, stimulate your mind, raise your consciousness, tingle your toes,
or just make you feel better, that you can just go buy in a store.
 
     Or worse design for yourself on a work bench.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                 PAGE 8
 
 
     The FDA wants to either ban these machines outright, or make their
approval process so impossible that none would remain on the market.
 
     They want you to PROVE the efficacy of such bio feedback and other
mind machines before they are allowed on the market, as if inner well
being can be proven to a jerk in a white coat.
 
     Besides you gotta be a human being before you can recognize that
someone else is doing better in life.
 
     Anyhow, the FDA has already gone through this process with the
Scientology E-meter and they lost that battle hook, line and sinker.
 
     But did they learn anything from that experience?
 
     NOOOOOOOOO!.
 
     Except how dangerous freedom of religion is along with the freedom
to know about yourself and do what you can to improve your own life
WITH YOUR OWN HANDS.
 
     So now they are trying for another stab at the mind machine market
by going after everyone else.
 
     I mean are we cattle in their genetic breeding farm?  Are they
afraid we might harm ourselves and ruin their plans for world conquest
through making a buck if we looked into our own well being and took
some responsibility for what we want to ingest or take into our own
bodies?
 
     What would happen if all the cattle in the world just up and said
'No more hormones!, we are going to eat what we want to eat!'
 
     Would the economy go under?  Should we all just shut up and take
whatever the government in its almighty wisdom and CARING feeds us?
 
     You know people are always pointing out, 'Well if you just let
people do whatever they wanted to, just whatever came into their little
ole heads, they would just eat sugar and candy all day long you know,
and then turn to drugs and other horrible things and the whole world
would just go to pot!'
 
     You want to know what the world's biggest addiction is?
 
     DOCTORS.
 
     This is deadly serious business, in my personal blind, ignorant,
biased, and prejudiced opinion the FDA, the AMA, the WHO and the NIMH
couldn't give a damn about your health or your well being, they care
only about their own power and the pocketbooks of their masters.
 
     Entire companies will go out of business if these laws are allowed
to pass or stand, populations will be at the mercy of the AMA quacks
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                 PAGE 9
 
and psychiatric drug dealers, and free thought and experimentation on
the subject of health and inner well being will become criminal by law.
 
     You want this?
 
     Well read on if you don't, and for heaven's sake write your
congressman today, fax them, tell them what you think, give them a
piece of your mind.
 
     If enough people give their congressmen a piece of their mind,
maybe they will have a mind too!
 
     And by all means redistribute this posting to as many people as
you can who might care about our freedoms and personal free choice in
this matter of our physical well being.
 
    I am sorry if this posting has been a bit hysterical or off the
wall, but hell I have a reputation to upkeep.
 
     Besides some of my best friends are doctors.
 
     And now that I have written this, I guess I should consider making
friends with a few lawyers too, eh?

                     HEALTH FREEDOM IN AMERICA 1992
                   KEY POINTS USUALLY NOT DISCUSSED.
 
     This is written as an addendum to pro-choice discussions about
health freedoms which, it is assumed, properly speak for free choice of
dietary supplements and properly identify the pending legislation worthy
of attention.  This document is intended to do 2 things only:  (A) Point
out how important it is to frame the issue as a matter of Minority
Rights and tolerance of diversity and (B) point out how important it is
to preserve protections not only for vitamins and dietary supplements
but also for harmless devices.
 
     Health Freedom must be discussed as what it is if the communication
is to be effective: It is an issue of minority rights.  It is not an
issue about consumer protection, nor is it an debate about the validity
of health alternatives.  The FDA can counter many of our opinions.  It
cannot counter our primary point: that the FDA will not tolerate
minority views.  It decides what is legitimate and what is not, and it
will not allow products used by people holding dissenting views about
health and medicine to be marketed.  If the issue is discussed in these
precise terms only, the grassroots support for freedom will be enormous,
and we can defeat these important erosions of our basic freedoms.
 
     Currently, the FDA forbids treatments and products which it deems
unsupported by "scientific consensus" not just over questions of safety
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                 PAGE 10
 
but also EFFICACY as determined by the FDA.  MANY Americans disagree
with the FDA's reading of what is a "scientific consensus" particularly
regarding efficacy, and our rights to access alternatives we value are
already compromised.  The FDA tends to function in a way that enforces a
monopoly.  This monopoly defines the kind of medical care available in
the USA.  In the name of consumer protection, providers of any
alternative medical care, dietary supplements and health-related devices
are sometimes already, and in the future may be more fully and
frequently forced to prove efficacy to the FDA, a prohibitively
expensive and time consuming process except for large, well financed
corporations.  If alternatives are marketed without such approval, the
FDA can enforce its prohibition of alternatives without affording the
providers of alternatives "due process".
 
     There exists a "revolving door" between the medical/pharmaceutical
industry and the FDA.  FDA personnel tend to be hostile to healthcare
alternatives that don't come out of the mental set which they share with
the "orthodox" medical community.  They are blind to these biases, and
they freely enforce these biases to the point of prohibiting access to
alternatives they frequently do not understand.
 
     New legislation threatens to increase FDA regulation & harassment
of alternative healthcare providers and companies making and selling
dietary supplements and devices.  Other new legislation may help
safeguard access to alternative choices.  This is extremely important
legislation.  The primary supporters of the objectionable legislation
have been liberal Democrats (Waxman, Dingell, Kennedy & Metzenbaum) and
the primary opponents of the objectionable legislation (and primary
sponsors of the protective legislation) have been conservative
Republicans (Hatch).  This does not set out an appropriate position for
progressives (liberals and Democrats).  It is critical that Democrats
publicly break with Waxman, Dingell, and their anti choice legislation
and anti choice influence in Congress.  Countless voters care deeply
about this issue & the pending legislation.  Because it is a deeply-felt
issue, having to do with key choices about our own bodies and well-
being, it is highly emotional, and it will politicize many successful,
articulate people.  It will build as an issue & it won't go away.
 
     Devices are very important, too.  As our view of the human body
includes more and more awareness of electromagnetic mechanisms and
"energy" we will want to approach our own health not just via chemistry
but through physics.  Physics means devices.  Devices which are (1) non-
invasive and safe, and which (2) are not claimed to cure disease
conditions, need to enjoy protections similar to those we have won for
vitamins and are working towards for all other dietary supplements.  If
this is left out of our protective legislation, then we'll have missed
an essential dimension of our needed protections.  20 years ago the
Proxmier Amendment left out protections for various dietary supplements
when it protected vitamins, and now we are having to fight for our basic
rights yet again because of this omission.  Devices will be the next
"hole" in our rights if we don't get them protected now.

Subject: Fun toy for sale

        I noticed that there's a fun little visual/trip toy for sale today.
It's one of Bill Burroughs/Brion Gysin Dream Machines, a nifty little
twirling display with funky colors. It was (if I remember its history
correctly) designed to, when stared into for a while, engender really
bizarre dreams. Anyhow, someone in the For Sale part of the East Bay Express
is offering to sell one for $100. It's out of my price range, but it's
presumably something that would interest some people...

I think 808 State is one of, if now the, best techno sound groups
today. As a musician myself, I know how easy it is to make 'formula'
house music. 808 is not formula.

They are DJing at a rave in San Mateo tonight (Wish). I'm definitely
going.

Alley Cat (last night in the King St Garage) was good - I got there early
to get in before 11 ($5 before 11, $10 afterward).  The first DJ was pretty
good, but there weren't enough people there yet (only a few were dancing)
don't know who he was, but then Carlos came on at around 11:30.  He was
continuing the groove then there was a brief sound outage; afterward, he
came back strong!  He started with the beginning vocal from Led Zeppelin's
Black Dog ("Hey Hey man saw the way you move Gonna make you sweat Gonna 
make you groove" (I might have a couple words wrong there, excuse me all
you Zep fans)) and started working his crossfader magic (sacrilege maybe
to you purists, but it works for me) - switching between songs between   
beats, revitalizing our rave classics.  OK, a couple of times it didn't
work, but fun nonetheless.   

Some flyers:

Actually, I agree.  Perhaps I was being a bit vindictive there.  What I
was trying to relay was that the space itself has received a couple 
complaints as not being a good place to have an event, but that can 
certainly change if the right people are throwing it (and the Gathering
folk have their s**t together)  Maybe a few of us should go to see how
it turns out...

In a more general sense, though:  how much can we use past judgements as
criteria for judging which ones to go to?  I mean, if a new group of
promoters throw an event that gets busted, our mindset is to avoid any
new event they throw.  Maybe this is false.  Everyone is entitled to
make mistakes, and if we just go to parties thrown by established groups
of promoters, then we discourage new people from entering the scene.
This holds for everything: assuming that because the last rave(s) at Bonny
Doon were good doesn't mean that future ones there will always be good,
just because Spun and Carlos are on a flyer doesn't guarantee that
they'll be at top form that night, just because Feel-X is reviled by
a couple of us here doesn't mean that once in a while they might do
something right...  all I'm saying is, maybe we shouldn't be as vindictive
as we could be.  Believe me, I want as much for my $10-$20 as everyone
else; but we should be willing to experiment.  All 400 people at Connection
were willing to experiment.  I Magi Nation sounded like a gamble, but it
happened to.  I can think of about 40 cliches to use right now ("variety
is the spice of life", etc.) but I won't. :)

Brian's quite right in his last message -- after Derek's negative reference
to the Jama Rave, I should point out that I met the organizers one night
outside Come-Unity.  They seemed like decent, well-intentioned (if quite
young) guys.  When I mentioned the fights and aggro I heard about, they
explained that a KMEL DJ publicized their event on the night, against
their wishes, causing a number of undesired elements to show up.  If
that's true, it certainly wasn't their fault.

(BTW, they're planning their next rave on a beach somewhere -- Bonny
Doon perhaps -- and they're going to call it Tidal Rave... sigh.)

Another example would be the violent incident that happened at the
FMR in February -- it would have been absurd to conclude all future
FMR's were to be avoided.

Now, Feel-X on the other hand...

> All 400 people at Connection were willing to experiment.

Well, it's easier getting people to experiment if it doesn't mean
having to spend anything...

Sure they are.  808 State jumps on every bandwagon that passes by.  "Pacific"
was their shot at ambient house, "Cubik" was their shot at techno, and
"Reaper Repo" (the b-side of the current single) is their shot at tribal.
All of these tracks are very well done, but every one of them falls into
the formula that is trendy at the time.

All right then, let's do it this way, name your favorite recordings,

I would love to see a list of sfraves favorites. I'll start with
Psychic TV and 808 State.

Subject: One Step Beyond (beware)


	Regardless, of the promoters, One Step Beyond is a very unravey
	place. The staff who are working there are One Step Beyond
	employees. The typical events that go on there are thrash/metal
	shows. These people are used to dealing with a bunch of drunk,
	headbangers (yes, I'm stereotyping here) and that is what
	their policies are set up to deal with. Some of the crap I've had
	to put up with from them are:

	1. searches (reassuring at a metal show, rude and unecessary at a rave)
	2. no water can be brought in (so they can charge 50c a cup?)
	3. disorganized lines to get in (to the point where the only way to 
	   get in at all is to cut in at the front and force your way in)
	4. no ins and outs (they wouldn't even let me run in just after the 
	   rave ended and get a sweatshirt I forgot)
	5. no backpacks
	6. general rudeness

	This is not to say that there can't be a good rave there, and
	there have been, but after dealing with all the crap I usually
	have to go through to get in, I usually am not in a good mood 
	for raving. If too many people have the same experience, the rave
	never gets off to a good start.

	Note that the Omni and the Stone are run by the same people and
	I ran into the exact same thing at the Stone last weekend. The
	rave was great (albeit crowded), but getting in was hell.

	One more strike against them, they are a pay-to-play establishment.
	Most of the opening bands that play in live shows there are
	required to sell a certain number of tickets to the show. If they
	fail to sell all of their tickets, the money comes out of their
	own pockets.

	Sigh is right!

	I certainly hope that whoever decides to hold  raves doesn't
confuse Santa Cruz' so far tolerance of the occasional beautiful thing
with some sort of rave promised land......yet at least.  If Bonny Doon
gets shut down it will be all gone.  

	Right now, we are trying to work it out with the local powers
that be and unlike other communities, the door is open.  I really hope
nobody comes down here and screws it up like they have in other areas!

 Yes, although some of the prettiest ones are probably lipstick lesbians.
 ( You can look, but don't bother touching ... ) And if a gal is really
working out on the dancefloor, leave her be - she's probably more interested
in her altered state of consciousness than getting "picked up" or otherwise
hassled.

 I'd say yes, except that some people have different ideas about what a "club
-like" atmosphere is. Remember - the primary mission at a rave is to 
D A N C E ... everything else is gravy. The music at raves shares at least 
one quality with old disco - only someone who's deaf AND dead will be unable
to dance to it. At least there isn't a rave "dance step" yet, like the Bump
or the Hustle for old disco! Rave dancing is not dancing for the benefit of
onlookers, like ballet - it is for the benefit of the dancer. Synchronizing
mind and moving muscle to the music. 

>

 If you are a South Bay resident, I might suggest taking the train to a 
177 Townsend event. The train station is just 1.5 blocks from the club; from
the San Francisco depot, walk towards 2nd on Townsend. However, be prepared
to stay until after 4AM - the first train doesn't leave for the South Bay 
until 4:50AM. The cost is $4 one-way. Another option, diss'd as it is, are
events at One Step Beyond - probably within 4 or 5 blocks walking distance
from a #22 busstop on El Camino.

Being very similar to the original 60's rock shows with
extensive light shows and very energizing dance music,
utilizing both computers and 1960's technology, people of
all ages are expected to attend.

Proceeds will directly benefit Hurricane Andrew survivors in
Florida.

Smart Drinks and organic tea will be served versus alcohol.

DJs for the evening include Goa Gil from India (his last
U.S. show), Tumbleweed aka B.R.A.D from San Francisco (Mr.
Floppy's), and Brandon E. from Santa Cruz.  A massive
improvisationally based authentic 60's-90's light show by
Reed and friends of San Francisco (Toon Town and Carefree).
A Computer Animation and Video Show by Greg MacNicol
(SIGGRAPH) and Craig Larson (Toon Town) with computerized
lighting by Norton (SHARON etc.).  Smart Bar by Anubus
Warpus with support from the Nutrient Cafe (Toon Town etc.),
and Organic Teas by Satori.

There will be a beach party Sunday morning.

This show was coordinated by Computer/Video Artist Craig
Larson of the Earthquake Relief Concert Series and DJ Brad
Reichardt.

Went to Wicked last night to check out the space .

now I know why they call it Wicked.  It was as hot as Hell down there
(literally maybe 110 deg.)


But IT WORKED.

Wicked's angle is yeah it's hot,steamy, sweaty and WICKED, don't you love it.

LOTS of Gender Bending....

I fell in love with this 6 ft. Blonde GODDESS but alas .... she broke my heart. :)

Talked to MoonPup at the EndUp, he needs gigs and to get his name around
preferably paying, but he needs exposure. I just thought I would pass this on to you

listen, Brian, you and I have had our philosophic differences in the

thought-provoking post such as the above.

and --> a cynical remark re what difference does it make re voting.

I wrote a long reply.  I'll spare you.  it's in my archive.

just do it.

if you don't vote you give MORE power to the people who do,
like me, your average gun-totin tobacco chewin southern kkk
fanatic like me.  see ?  although we may not be able to assume
voting works, there's no harm in taking half an hour to do it
occasionally.  you don't even have to give them a street address
anymore when you register--all you need is a p.o. box.  so it's
not like they can use your voter registration to "track" you
the way some would suggest.  sure, they can track you via a
p.o. box, but that takes some effort.

Equinox was in a concrete bunker at Fort Funston above Lake Merced.
Rox and I arrived at 2:00AM to find three people dancing, there
were less than 100 people there sitting on blankets and standing
around.  Didn't recognize the DJ, minimum lighting (Radio Shack
strobes) and for your $10 there was not a drop of water or other
drinks to be found.  The energy level was low, we left after a
half hour.  I would be hesitant to attend future Equinox events.
We both feel we were ripped off.

PS - The site was wonderful a beautiful view of Lake Merced from
up there and well hidden.  A promising place for a future rave?

As I look back, I realize that I had a really good time at WICKED.
It would be even better if it wasn't so hot down there.  But for 
dedicated ravers, you learn to just incorporate the circumstances.
At one point, I came out to get some air, (in-out were definately allowed
and necessary) as I emerged into the out side someone said "look! he's steaming".  I had this image that this is what "raver hell" would be like.
Well as long as Garth is spinning it might not be such a bad place :@)
I originally went to WICKED to check out the space but eventually
there were little men in the bushes so I don't know  how objective
my observations were.

I've got a four story building (with enormous basement) for the 10th of
October.  Not only that, it is in the heart of downtown.  In short, this rave
is going to be massive.  I'll probably have two sound systems going on two
different floors, as well as a chill floor and concessions.

This is a call to anyone in San Fran willing to make the trip to Salt Lake.
If you want to do lights, DJing, whatever, let me know.  At this point I can't
guarantee any sort of payment, but if you are truly interested, let's talk.
It is about a 14 hour drive here or a $110 round trip flight.  I'll let
whoever wants to crash at my place.  I have a fairly spacious living room.

Preliminary (very little info) flyers are going out to the mailing list
tonight.  The final flyer will go out next week.  If anyone wants to
distribute flyers for me there (or anywhere else), mail me.

	Well, I had a great time at equinox. The location was incredible
	close to the city and yet in a deserted enough location not to
	bother anyone. Walk a bit in one direction and you have an amazing
	panoramic view of the city. Walk a bit in the other direction and
	you're at the top of a cliff overlooking the ocean.

	The rave itself was under an overhang at the entrance to a concrete
	bunker. There were 3 DJs. The third was Garth, I didn't recognize
	tho other two (nor did anyone I talked to), but they were great. I
	wish I knew who they were, so I could look for them in the future.
	There was an unfortunately low percentage of people dancing, but
	that left lots of dance space for people who wanted to dance, like
	me (I don't care if I'm the only one dancing). 
	
	Plusses for this rave. The music was good. It was very underground 
	(go to the map point, find a parking lot, then get shuttled to the
	location in the back of a rental truck). The crowd was friendly,
	if not particularly energetic. The location was wonderful. It
	didn't get busted.

	Overall, I had a great time, and I will look forward to future
	Equinox raves, but I can see how some people could have not

Anyone else here head down to Pull my Finger in Oakland.  When I got there,
there was salsa music playing in half the bar, and techno in the smallish
front room.  Looked like it might turn into a good party.  Sadly, some dude
whom I had never met, got into my face, yelling "What the fuck are you doing
here, man!" and "Fuck you," as I was beginning to blast. Rather than waste
perfectly good party supplies, I headed back across the bridge to Carefree
which was ok, but nothing spectacular.  Anyway, was wondering how the rest

1) Anything on the UK label Wonka Beats.  Everything I've heard on Wonka
is absolutely amazing, most of it being sort-of tribal house-ish stuff.
The records I have from Wonka are "Drum Attack" by Jambo, a double 12"
by Aquastep, "It's Just a Feeling" by Serendipity, and "Tribal Journey"
by Traveller II.  Most of Wonka's 12" singles have three of four different
songs (i.e. not just remixes of the same track).

2) Studio X: "Los Kings del Mambo" b/w "Join the Tribe".  The A-side is
a bit overplayed but I still love it.  The B-side is a very cool tribal
track and is often overlooked.

3) Sergio Mendez: I'm not sure of the title, but he has a 12" single out
that has some truly out-of-the-ordinary non-4/4 tribal percussion.

yes, it HAS come to this... alas, I'm thinking that if I ever see
anything overtly described as a rave, I'll just make sure I'm on the
other side of town. seems like the term has been cheapened to the
point where it's really not much different from yer average
KMEL-sponsored dance party. 

Like when i talk to some of my hipster friends from kawlich, they'll
say "you went to a rave??? since when did you become mainstream?"

Maybe we need to come up with a term longer than one syllable in order
to keep out the riff-raff. Maybe if they can't pronounce it, they
won't come.... (naaaah, they'll probably think it's something new from
Europe and therefore even trendier; next thing they'll be asking their
mommas for a bigger allowance so they can replace all their rave
fashion with the new stuff)... 

I'm fully expecting they'll soon have the Hairometer (tm) next to the
security droids at the door.... "Sorry, you can't come in, your hair
isn't regulation height."

On another sour note indicating where "rave" has gone... I saw the
following clothing ad in a surf magazine:

	Katin Anti-Rave Wear
		* No disco whitles
		* No stupid hats
		* No mindless house music
		* No detergent box logos
		* No silly sunglasses
		* No E-Tabs
		* No funky fresh anything

	Just serious high-quality surf stuff. Since 1959.

PS: maybe I'm just P.O.'d cuz some small-minded ravelet dissed my impeccable
sense of fashion taste and style -- "why would anybody wear THAT to a rave". 

PPS: fortunately, this is the bay area, and there's lots of good non-rave
events going on: 
	(1) George Clinton & P-Funk all stars (w/ Bootsy!) Sat Oct 3, 
	    Berkeley Community Theater.
	(2) Bob Ostertag and Fred Frith at the Great Am. Music Hall, Thu Sep 24

Subject: did anybody catch/record "Rave: the history of disco" on A&E channel?


It was on Sunday night at 8PM on the arts and entertainment channel
(cable).  Hosted by Ann Magnuson (sp?) of the band Bongwater. It had a
lot of potential, and it seemed to focus on the
music/fashion/sociology rather than trying to scare parents with "this
is what your kids are doing late at night..."

Unfortunately, 15 minutes through the screening, the sound died. 

Did anybody else catch/record the entire show WITH sound? Or does
anybody know when this is going to be shown again?  I can't exactly
call up the cable company and complain since my cable feed is pirated
off of my upstairs neighbors... 

They had interviews with lots of old DJs/producers from the early seventies,
then they started interviewing people in the house/rave vein, e.g.  
Dee-Lite, and  her DJs (Dimitri/TowaTowa (sp?)), Baby Ford, etc.

I recorded the video, but didn't get any sound. Lotsa nice pictures, cool 
video effects used throughout. But no sound... Bwwwwaaaaah!

In the part with sound, some of the old-timers described the disco
scene in 1972 -- underground wherehouse/loft parties, word-of-mouth
only, all night dancing, mixed race, mixed sexual orientation.
Basically, sounded just like the rave scene... 

You have to realize that there was a vibrant "black disco" scene going
on on the east coast (Philly, NYC) long before "the hustle" and
"saturday night fever" watered it down and made it palatable for
milquetoaste Amerikkka.

Of course, I was all of 8 years old at the time, and living on the
wrong coast too... Fortunately, I have some of the original albums!

and where did I put that Barry White album anyways?

I was predicting the scene would be stale by February. Was I off.  All
it took was for school to come back in.

Push the edge. That's what it's all about. The fact of the matter is
people have been partying out of bounds forever. I've seen several
articles on TV about the new 'Disco Revival'. Disco was more about
speed than psychedelics. Raise your consciousness by having fun.
Nothing could piss off the authorites more!

I frankly think there's a lot more steam left in this. If you are 
still pushing the limits you will too. This post is a perfect tool
for it.

   I've heard this about a hundred times over the past few months, and frankly,
I'm really glad to see the "scene" (as percieved by those who are into the 
"scene") DIE!!!  I thought the whole "rave" concept was that there was NO scene,
NO fads, and NO methods...  It was just a bunch of music enthusiasts (and drug
too) who like to dance, getting together with a bunch of other dance happy
music enthusiasts (and drugs too) to listen to the music really loud, and 
promote self-reliance.  Raves, or Undergrounds as they were called, have become
what they purported to reject in thier beginnings.  I'm really happy to see the
"scene" die, and see some really fun, interesting parties rise from the ashes.
Remember, if you truly love the music, and love the "unity" of a common love of
music and dance, then you'll find other things to go to.  People, and society
evolve...  Therefore, the "scene" (a mere product of the two) will evolve to.

Sorry for the sermon...  (I type it as I think it...)

Subject: Weekend Update


	I should have posted about this earlier...

	Friday night was, er, interesting, as I'm sure many of you can tell
from the posts made that night. "It's at the Gift Center!" "No, it's at 650
Howard", etc....

	What happened was this:  "Wish" was going to be at the Bay Meadows
Race Track (in one of the indoor lobbies or something, not outside).  ON
Friday afternoon someone called the poilce and said there were going to
be "lots of kids on drugs there", so th police called the owners of Bay
Meadows and said, "It would be in YOUR best interests if you DIDN'T hold
your event tonight."  Nevermind the fact that all the permits were obtained,
that this was going to be fully legal, and that this was the afternoon of
the night of the evnt.  So Bay Meadows called Gavin Hardkiss and cancelled.
At this point Gavin hadn't paid them any money, but having to find a location
at the last minute is next to impossible for the number of people they were 
expecting.

      By 10:30 Gavin had contacted a few people at the Gift Center at 8th
and Brannan, and that seemed like a go.  I had showed up early, so I offered
to help move furniture and stuff to set up the dance floor.  After myself and
the Hardkiscrew had moved about 2 tons worth of tables andhairs, the
owner of the Gift Center came up to Gavin and demanded $15,000 UP FRONT, in
CASH, before he'd let the first person in.  Gavin made some calls but couldn't
find anyone with that on them.  He would have had no problem giving the money
after the event, as he was expecting 2000+ people at $15-$20 each, but
he couldn't come up with it in advance (and with that amount of lead time
could anyone have?).  So after arguing to no avail, the owner kicked us out
and told the roughly 400 people outside the gift center that the rave was
cancelled.  Gavin immediately said, "don'tlisten to him, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.  The rave will go on as promised,  I will find us
a new space.  Call the number in 20 minutes."  And with that he and a few
others sped off, presumably to find us a space.

About 45 minutes later word came that it would be at 650 Howard, but we were
told not to show up until 2:30 or 3.  With that news most of the crowd decided
to turn in for the night and abandon "Wish" - fortunately they were they kind
who also said "aw, fuck it.  Let's just go get drunk."

At 2:30 I ent down to 650 Howard.  The club that was there earlier was just
letting out - nicely dressed, predominately black, hip-hop crowd, who looked
bemused upon the sight of the gaggle of ravers forming outside.  The light
guys showed up, the sound guys showed up, and then by three they started letting
people in.

When WISH finally got going, it really got going.  People were just so happy
to finally be _dancing_ that the atmosphere was great.  What was going to
be an event with 2000+people became a mini-event with 40 tops.  Still,
I got to meet the members of 808, which was a huge thrill for me personally.
Their DJ skills were better than I thought they would be, but they had an
annoying habit of saying, "Hello San Francisco!  C'mon, get going!", etc.,
that had the most peculiar effect on the crowd (about half started cheering,
the other half froze with a look on their faces like, "WHAT WAS THAT?!?!")

Jon Williams from LA was hard, skillfull, but not totally inspiring...

Spacetime came on after 808 State, around 5 in the morning, and started 
playing some incredibly fast, hard stuff (including digeridoo).  This
lost a lot of their energy and were ready for more mellow, funkier stuff
(gratefully supplied by Scott and Robbie Hardkiss after that).

By morning ti
time everyone who had stayed to the last song cheered, and
when I talked to gavin as I was leaving he said he probably lost $10,000 on
the night. :(

I was hoping to go to the get-out-the-vote event in GG Park, but I was
too pooped to go.  Anyone from the list go?  How was it?

Subject: Re:  Raves and pre-trendy disco


My girifriend also describes the scene at some of the raves we've been
to as very reminiscent of disco here in SF in the 70s -- not the yuppy
Travolta- clone discos, but the semi-underground ones, of which only
the End-Up and (until recently) the I-Beam survive.  Well, I'm a few
years younger, so my memories of disco are all people wearing polyester
and doing "The Hustle" (back then I was a introverted dweebie punker,
anyhow) (I'm still introverted and dweebie, but at least now I don't
mind dancing and making a fool of myself) (but I digress).  Some of the
Soulful Wailing Diva-style techno/house does sound like slightly faster
disco leftovers, to the discerning ear.  So whaddya think -- how long
until some crafty promoter simply re-releases the old K-tel "Disco
Fever" albums under the title "Techno Fever" and cleans up?

On the other hand (and going back to some discussions about Trev-baby Horn
a few weeks ago), do you think it's possible techno would have hit it big about
ten years ago if "Frankie Goes To Hollywood" hadn't split up?  I was actually
expounding on this very topic just last week, sitting in Hot 'n' Hunky
Burger's on 18th, and what song should come on the juke box *just as I brought

Subject: What's the real reason drugs are illegal?


This is long and it has little to do with raving so delete now.

What's the real reason drugs are illegal?

I've been trying to come up with a good answer for myself.  Why are drugs 
illegal in the U.S.?  Nature has been kind enough to us humans to provide us
with pot, shrooms, peyote catus, etc., etc. and yet an organization of humans
(the law people - law makers & enforcers) have semi-successfully prevented us
from easily obtaining what nature has given.

Why is that?  My first answer was to figure that the law-people made up these
laws to abolish the use of drugs to protect a citizen from destroying 
him\herself.  But that just doesn't jive anymore.  Alcohol is legal and so is 
food.  So if someone really wants to fuck themselves over they can easily 
over-comsume alcohol or eat too much or even take sleeping pills.

Someone suggested that the reason drugs must be illegal in this country is to
protect the public from someone who is irresponsible & on drugs simultaneously.
Some irresponsible person who is tripping could go out and mow down a sidewalk
of people because he is hallucinating that he's mowing down corn stalks.  Ok
that makes sense but some people still manage to exhibit extremely violent 
behavior even while sober.  If the reason drugs are illegal is to protect the
rest of society from mad drug crazed people then how come pot is not allowed 
for AIDS patients?  According to last night's news, currently 14 seriously ill
people in the US have been authorized by the FDA to take pot for medical 
reasons.  Fourteen out of several hundred thousand at least.  Why isn't the 
FDA allowing people who are going to die in a few years or months (and are 
probably no threat to society) from getting stoned?  There's got to be a 
reason behind this!

Ever notice that the legal rights of an inhabitant of this country has been
slowly eroded over the past few decades in the name of fighting drugs?  
Law-enforcers (cops) can search you or your belongings now much more easily
than they could in the 1960s.  All they need now is a probable cause within
their minds.  It seems like almost everything the government law sector talks
about (including the president) is this war on drugs.  I mean, the US even
invaded another country (Panama) on the "official" reason of fighting this 
war on drugs (by the way, this documentary I saw says that twice the amount of
cocaine is now funnelling through Panama than before the U.S. invasion).

I still can't figure it out.  Why are drugs illegal for the general population
and why are they illegal for terminally ill patients?  Excuse me for becoming
paranoid, but I'm beginning to think this war on drugs is some kind of plot.
Bush seems to refer to this war on drugs like every other sentence he says.
Yet the results from his war on drugs supply-wise are non-existant EXCEPT for 
the fact that the police now have more potential control over every individual
in this country.  And it seems like the media and a lot of foolish citizens 
are just eating all this up.

I've figured out one potential reason: the powers that be do not want to see
people enjoying themselves on drugs.  But I can't figure out why.  Are they 
jealous? Are they scared?  I can't figure this out.  Sorry for not providing
an answer.  Just more questions.

T                   A                        X                        I

ps.  anybody is free to agree or disagree with me.  I will make no attempt to
defend what I've said above.  I just want to stimulate some thought so that
someone can come up with the real reason drugs are illegal in this country. 
Maybe we can start with finding the real reason pot is not allowed for 
terminally ill patients in this country.

Money.  This really isn't a suitable discussion forum.  I suggest you
read alt.drugs or talk.politics.drugs where this thing comes up over
and over again.

Pot was outlawed because it makes very cheap paper and some very
prominent businessmen had just bought up a lot of tree pulp paper
producing mills.  Thus they wanted to insure that they had guaranteed
business.  Racism played a large part as well.

I suggest you read "The Emperor Wears No Clothes" by Jack Herer.

Eye think that it is true, we must have slack for past mistakes.  I'm sure
that the Creation planners didnt invite the cops to Creation at the
Waterslides!  OTOH I am _not_ going to _any_ raves in Santa Clara or San
Jose.  Sorry!  Why drive all that way when I know in advance how eager the

maybe it is a mistake to keep going back.  I never started slagging Feel-X

against Sharon, even though Electric Jellyfish ended early back in March [or
was it May?].   In  fact, I've had great times raving at Sharons since.  

I agree that Santa Cruz has been amazing so far and I'm holding my breath

Eye think "the scene" is up to you to define.  I count the scene as smaller
[or anyway more underground] raves.  I don't even consider stuff I can tell
is gonna be horrid to be part of the scene.  What it is is up to us.  I saw
that so clearly at Connection.  I think the exciting part is only just
beginning [for the night it still young!]  We just learned how to do a party
or actually I think we learned that it is possible.  Why worry about the
word rave being co-opted?  That happened a while ago, and was unavoidable.
Not to get on a rant [again!] but I truly believe that what we have is
robust and will live as long as we have energy to put into it.  It will only
die if not enough people care or want it enough to do it.
Just MHO!

It wasn't *that* small... when I showed up there must have been 100, maybe
150 people.  There were lots of people sitting upstairs and along the sides.
Still, a major letdown.  What kind of jerk would get ahold of a rave
flyer, wait until the night, call the info number, and intentionally
destroy this event?  In hindsight, maybe they should have waited
until mid-evening before announcing the location, legal though it was.

Maybe we on the list should refrain from posting locations in advance.

Excellent laser effects, sometimes shining on a mirrored ball, it projected
what seemed like thousands of green laser raindrops all over the place.
Heavy on the fog, it seemed to smother the dancers. Music sounded great,

Subject: Re: What's the real reason drugs are illegal? 

the reason why drugs are illegal are the following:

(1) illegal drugs mean artificially high prices, high profits for the dealers.

(2) The biggest dealer is the US govt. (CIA) -- they've been selling drugs for
    at least 30 years to fund covert operations in order to destabilize 
    independent or anti-US governments.
	* Before and during the vietnam war, it was heroin.
	* For the Contras, it's been cocaine.
	* the above are just the known facts -- we'll find out more after
	  Bush gets voted out of office. (Remember, once CIA, always CIA, and
          guess who our dear prez worked for and presided over?) 

(3) People would stop buying tobacco and alchohol -- an area where established
    power (and the $$$ that goes w/ that) has set and controlled government
    policy.

(4) Creating a "problem" ensures employment and funding for the "solution" --
    the police, the military, the FBI. Is it any wonder that Colin Powell says
    that there will be no peace dividend from ending the cold war because we
    have a war on drugs to fight?!

(5) All the low-level dealers and users that wind up in prison make for good 
    slave labor. Remember that the riches of this country wouldn't have been
    possible without slavery. With all this double-speak about democracy,
    we can't openly condone slavery, but we can ensure that we're the 
    country with the largest percentage of incarcerated population. Ever
    wonder who made your licence plate?

(6) Because the US govt. doesn't have to operate in an openly racist fashion
    any more in order to practice genocide against non-whites. Just throw the
    fuel (crack) onto the inner city fire, and let it burn, baby, burn.
    I don't know about you, but I can hear the gunshots in the night
    from across the freeway.... 

(7) A war on drugs takes people's attention away from the criminal actions of
    our own government. Bush wouldn't want the smoke to clear enough for
    people to realize that he was overseeing S&L deregulation during Reagan's
    presidency. Or his role in October surprise... Or his dealings w/ Saddam
    Hussein to leverage a victory against Iran, or...
    
And ya wonder what all the Rastafarians are talking about when they
mention the "Babylon System". I don't!

There's a belief among some of the rave kids (myself included) that the house
movement and the resulting raves are much more than "interesting parties".  To
some, these raves are a chance for humanity to come together and grow -- to
fulfill our destiny as sentient beings.  The positive energy and all-accepting
attitudes at raves are the key that will allow peoples of different cultures
and backgrounds to connect and communicate.  The fact that raves have been held
on multiple continents, attracting thousands of people, shows that this
phenomenon is more than just an American scene.

In Europe, India, Japan, the US, and Mexico, raves have grown.  I'm sure that
the only common themes are house music and Ecstasy.  But Ecstasy is what has
allowed it to happen.  The "warm fuzzies" that E induces allows people to open
up and accept everyone else as equals and as comrades.  All it takes is a
smile.  As artificial as the effect may seem to an outside observer, the effect
stays with people over time.  I have certainly become more accepting of others
and less judgemental after being accepted as part of the rave family.  Others
have had similar experiences, and have come to feel part of a family, so to
speak.  It is easy to fall into the E-mindset without haveing taken it that
night (or that lifetime), just by being around those who are up. 
Extrapolating, it's possible for everyone in a group to get into that
mindset just by realizing that it's the mindset to be in for that group of
people.  Extrapolate that mindset to all of humanity and we're on the right
track.

How many of you have been to a rave where there's an energy in the air; where
it seems that everyone has risen to the next plane of existence and is
communicating on a different level; where the whole is greater than the sum of
the parts?  With or without E, I've felt this sensation a few times and it
really is powerful.  Imagine that same level of non-verbal, non-visual, non-
definable communication on a global scale.  This is what the "scene" is all
about -- not partying.

Certainly, the promoters and egoists who jumped onto the rave bandwagon to make
a buck (or to make a name) have mired these unacknowledged ambitions with
commercialism.  But once the media attention dies down and the people who
are into this just as a party theme get bored, the collective philosophy will
remain.  

However, to put the whole movement into terms more suitable to a movement, we
need converts to the new religion.  The only way to get more people into the
"scene" is by expanding through these mega-raves.  People who try out this rave
thing, just to see what it's all about, may see through the commercialism and
realize that this is what they've been looking for.  They are the ones who will
seek out the elders of the "church" and join the cause to help proselytize and
evangelize.  Whatever happened to the Rhythm Society?  An organized (or at
least verbalized) realization of these ideas may have been too premature.

As much as I complained about that first article in the Bay Guardian about the
rave scene last fall, it did the movement good, even if it hurt the "scene". 
New people were converted through their initial trips to Toon Town.  I think
similar results will come from SFNet and any other means we have of reaching
people who would not otherwise find out about these happenings.

It's a shame that the descriptor "rave" has been appropriated and subverted for
purposes not remotely related to the house movement, but there's not much we
can do.  (There actually was a gay nude "rave" last August.)  As Brian Campbell
writes, "the scene will evolve."  New terms and ways of communicating the ideas
will emerge to fill the void.  

The Millenium is upon us, and just like every other society whose calendar has
reached a throusand-year mark, Millenium Fever will grip on us.  A society with
Millenium Fever either prepares for the apocolypse or prepares for a quantum
leap in the evolution of society.  We may be experiencing both symptoms here in
the US, but it's my hope that the positive side wins out.  Raves and the house
movement may just be what allow us to connect and make that quantum leap.

At this point, I won't get into how I think virtual reality, smart drugs, and
drumming enter into the picture, but some of you can probably make the
connections.  Speaking of which, I really did like the name of our rave.
Hope this wasn't too much for y'all.  Thanks for reading through to the end. 
See you all at the Promised Land!

Share and enjoy,

Tim

   The only 12" I know of off Sergio Mendez's new album is "Fanfarra
(Chabula le le)" [or is that the other way arround], b/w "What is
This?"  Fanfarra is a great song.  I've thought about using that and
some other live percussion like the Master Musicians of Jajouka at
raves.   But I'm not sure how well it would go over.
   I noticed that at the last rave (Millenium/Grape Ape II) I went to,
people stopped dancing if it wasn't a 4/4 beat.  ARgh!  I can't stand
a 4/4 for more than a few minutes before I get bored.

Tim, I welcome and pretty much agree with the spirit of your post, but...

The term "convert" implies the abandonment of one thing for another, i.e.
a form of escapism.  I personally like to think of the experience of 
raving as one where people bring who they are and expand upon it, 
finding connectivity and unity with other perspectives through a communal 
experience that fosters openmindedness and mental exploration.

>The only way to get more people into the

That's like saying that the only way to understand the teachings of
Jesus is through the Catholic Church.  Sorry, but that's one model I
would rather not see emulated.  In fact, I would say that the mega-raves
do more harm than good by creating a false idea of what raving is all
about.  I certainly didn't get into the "scene" that way.  In fact, I
almost left the "scene" based on some early mega-rave experiences.
But if you can go to something like The Promised Land and bliss out
without feeling manipulated and lost among the flock, more power to ya.

YES, 2000 is coming.. Sometimes I can feel it, like a wind sweeping me up from

Well, you should.  They rented Long Shoreman's Hall until 2 am and rented the 
Oasis from 2 am on.  They advertised that the rave was to be at Long Shoreman's
Hall without telling anyone that it was going to be moved to Oasis at 2 am.
The result was that at 2 am a *lot* of intoxicated people ended up driving
all over the place due to this slight omission of fact.

Face it.  Sharon == slimy irresponsible greaseballs out to make a quick buck.

Okay, now here's something out of left field.

We all love dancing, but how many of our favorite rave musicians can we
name? Interestingly enough, we can problably all name our favorite DJ's.

So at the same time I'm taking an interest in eastern religion. One of
the most fundimental principles is that that we have no soul (actually
it is referred to as having no 'permanent self'). We are all aggragates
caused by one thing or other that is constantly dying and being reborn.

What does this have to do with DJ's?

There is a perfect analogy here. The DJ is a vessel for the music. He
is simply bringing together the aggragates of musicians, only a few
of which we can name. And they are constantly dying and new ones
come onto the scene.

The DJ is what we would call our soul.

Think about that next time your meditating on the dance floor!

	Look at it this way. There are probably more, higher quality raves
	going on now than there were 6 or 12 months ago. It's just that
	with all of the mega-lousy raves clamoring for your attention 
	a smaller percentage of all the events going on are really good.
	Remember when there was only one event per weekend to choose from?
	Not every one of those was always so wonderful.

	On the other hand, I miss the days when I could go to a rave and
	expect to see 10-20 people who were always there. There's no sense
	of family in the community anymore, it's splintered off into
	a bunch of little cliques. But sfraves seems to have that feeling
	of family about it, sort of a scene within the scene. Maybe 
	Alternity will recapture the spirit of the community as it was 6 
	months ago.

	p.s. it's funny how you can feel like an oldtimer after only 6

  Kristian has raised a fascinating point.  I'll add a question/comment:
  Classical and jazz performing musicians respond to the energy and attention
that their audiences feed them.  If you're playing for a good audience, you
can take their energy, incorporate it in your playing, and give it back to
them, transformed into music. Musicians feed each other in he same way.
  Do rave DJs do this? Do they respond to the fluctuations of the moods of
the audience and adjust their own play accordingly?
  The last DJ I saw live, Moonpup, seemed to be oblivious to his audience.  
He played righteous music; but he stayed hunkered down over his dials and
records, and never gave the dancers a glance.

Subject: RE: The rave scene is not dead?


A friend of mine saw a program yesterday about the beginnings of the disco era.
He said that when it started out, they were just having underground parties
pretty much like the rave scene was doing before it went mainstream.  The music
was new - it was disco.  He said the people who went to these underground disco
parties pretty much had the same clothing fashion as the rave scene did a while
back - ie. wild & funky clothes.  These parties would go all night just like 
the raves.  He also said that some people interviewed for this program said 
that the atmosphere was a friendly crowd who -understood- eachother.  Drugs 
were also a major part of these parties.  This was before disco went 
mainstream.

After hearing this I made a prediction:  house will become as popular as disco
was.  There will be a house explosion just like there was a disco explosion.
(It's already like this in Europe).  The rave scene and the meaning behind
house music will be totally skewed from its original association by 
mainstreamers like modern John Travolas.  House will become as mainstream as
disco.  There will blockbuster Hollywood "house movies" maybe where boy meets
girl and dances the "house dance" the best to win girl.  Everybody will be 
wearing "house fashions" that are yet to be determined by greedy clothing
firms.  A majority of clubs will be playing only house music.  A  
"House industry" will crop up selling all kinds of "house trinkets" to the 
masses just like that which existed for the disco era.  The nightlife scene
which by some time in future will be only mainstream house will be a cliquey,
superficial scene where appearances mean everything.  Some form of house music
will dominate the music charts for years.  All the original meaning associated
with house music and raves of the past will be completely lost on the masses
thanks to ignorant media and greedy promoters.  Notice how the word, "raves" is
already often being misused to mean "party"?

Hey, didn't we talk about this on this list a while back?  Well it's happening.
Things have happened in this direction already since Toon Town got really big.
Not to fear.....  I'm wondering what the people with the original disco 
mindset were doing when disco became mainstream?  (grow wise?) I don't know.
But if the house scene ever reaches the prediction mentioned above, I'm gonna
look for raves with the original meaning intact and if I can't find one, I'll
start one in some future wharehouse that I'll call home.

NOW THIS IS THE KEY TO KEEPING THE SCENE ALIVE!!!   Just take a look at how well
Connection went.  Brian had this attitude, and it worked...  "Let's throw a rave
that will reflect the TRUE meaning of the 'scene'.  Furthermore, Let's make it
free!"  I used to worry about the really good undergounds fading out, or not 
being able to compete with the larger, more commercial events...  But no more!
People like Brian, and TAXI, and Pete Ashdown, and everyone else who holds this
philosophy will keep the scene, or rather, the new found "culture" alive!!!

I don't think we have to keep it alive at any costs, but I believe that we 
have to make the best effort to keep it fun and friendly so that we can 
enjoy it. 

If is going to change from "rave scene" to "whatever scene", it's fine for me.
I don't particularly care about the "rave scene" per-se but I care that
there is and there always be an "alternative scene" as opposed to a 
"commercial" one.

The "rave scene" made us to became friends and now we can't just say
"is dead" because we are still friends and we'll probably be friends for
a long time regardless of the "rave scene". May be is our responsability
to start a new scene or to drive the "rave scene" in the right direction
(I think that's what we did with Connection).

So Alternity is coming this week, let's all work together to make it fun so 
that we'll all be happy and willing to keep the "alternative scene" going.

Subject: scene talk

Hi, I'm a lurker...
That's my introduction...

This scene talk made me want to finally post to the list though...  I grew
up in Chicago, and was pretty heavy into the "punk" scene in the mid
eigties (after it first died, but before it was mainstreamed), and we had
to deal with a lot of the same issues.   Our once "intimate" shows became
overcrowded with annoying people who were just there to be cool, or
whatever.  Football types in the pits beating the shit out of people and
stuff.  It just became generally too much for me, and I dropped out of the
whole thing all together.  I'm starting to sense much the same feeling from
a lot of you, but one thing bothers me.  To me, the punk scene was a family
for those of us who didn't really have any.  There was also a unity of
thought (and action) in politics, and issues.  We attended rallies for
Pro-choice issues, and women's rights issues and freedom of speech issues.
 We were angry, at the system and the apathy amongst most people.  When
teeny-boppers started showing up, with no understanding of what I thought
it was all about, and when the shows went from being $5-$10 to $15-$20
shows, it was too much for a lot of us.  However, I don't see the same kind
of thing with the Rave community.  I can't find anything unifying you
except the desire to dance all night (and there is nothing wrong with
that).  So, although I can understand why you wouldn't want to have to pay
more for a rave, I don't understand how you can say that the scene is
dying.  What "values" of the scene are being diluted and warped by
mainstream corporate money-grubbers.  "Rave" clothes?  Most of the rave
clothes I have seen were already fashionable by the "suburban teen with a
parent's credit card" set.  I guess what I'm trying to find out is what
everyone considers the main elements of the "Rave Scene" are.  There is
definitely a community amongst you all, but as someone said before your
community is little more that a large group of friends, and no amount of
mainstreaming is going to change that.  I don't know, I guess I just want
more information.

Anyone who's been to a truly great rave knows the answer to this one, but
I'll quote from the Garth interview in the premier issue of RHYTHMOS magazine:

Garth:

    ... It's quite a spiritual event, when I'm playing records I don't feel
    like I'm sort of like, on a pedestal like some pop-star, and people
    are watching me like an audience.  I feel like we're all there doing
    it together.

Interviewer:

    But then, you are the controller?

Garth:

    In a sense but, if I'm not getting any feedback from the crowd, if
    they were all standing still, I wouldn't have anything to work
    with.  It's like everybody controls the environment.

Here's an example of what I think raves should be all about. I went to 
Fishbone last Friday night and tried (as I always do) to smile at everyone
I saw. Very few smiled back. At a good rave, almost everyone smiles back.

It's about a sense of community, like you said, a family for those who
have none. In mainstream society that sense of community and trust is not
there. As the rave scene becomes mainstream, or any scene for that matter,
the trust and community are diluted and eventually lost. And greedy promoters
don't help any, either.

=========================================

Infrastructure
for the Global Village

A high-capacity network will not be built
without government investment

by Al Gore

New technologies that enhance
the ability to create and under-
stand information have always
led to dramatic changes in civilization.
The printing press unleashed the forces
that led to the birth of the modern na-
tion state. It made possible the wide-
spread distribution of civic knowledge
that enabled the average citizen to af-
fect political decisions.

Now come distributed networks con-
necting a myriad of computers, ranging
from megaflop machines and work-
stations to desktop and personal lap-
top units. All are becoming less expen-
sive in each successive generation that
emerges. There is no longer any doubt
that such machines will reshape hu-
man civilization even more quickly and
more thoroughly than did the print-
ing press. Gutenberg's invention, which
so empowered Jefferson and his col-
leagues in their fight for democracy,
seems to pale before the rise of elec-
tronic communications and innova-
tions, from the telegraph to television,
to the microprocessor and the emer-
gence of a new computerized worldQ
an information age.

As in the past, original thinking is re-
quired to develop a system that will en-
able our civilization to make the most
sensible use of this potent technology.
There are valid concerns that computer
networks threaten the privacy and per-
sonal freedom of individuals. There are
equally valid worries that existing laws
do not adequately protect the rights
and liberties of computer users to ex-
press themselves in the new medium.

Even so, such concerns should notQ
and indeed, probably cannotQhalt the
sweeping changes that are already tak-
ing place. Just as information spewing
forth from the printing pre s was soon
protected in democratic states by a fair
and workable legal and ethical code, so,
too, a new body of common law is be-
ing built to cope with the new medium
of the computer network. Rather than
holding back, the U.S. should lead by
building the information infrastructure
essential if all Americans are to gain ac-
cess to this transforming technology.

The unique way in which the U.S.
deals with information has been the
real key to our success. Capitalism and
representative democracy rely on the
freedom of the individual, so these sys-
tems operate in a manner silIlilar to
the principle behind massively parallel
computers. These computers process
data not in one central unit but rather
in tiny, less powerful units distributed
throughout the computer.

Capitalism works on the same princi-
ple. People who are free to buy and sell
products or services according to their
individual calculations of the costs and
benefits of each choice process a rela-
tively litnited amount of information
but do it quickly. When millions of in-
dividuals process information simulta-
neously, the aggregate result is incredi-
bly accurate and efficient decisions.

Similarly, representative democra-
cy relies on the still revolutionary
assumption that the best way for
a nation to make political decisions is
for all its citizens to process the infor-
mation relevant to their lives and to ex-
press their conclusions in free speech
and in votes that are combined with
those of millions of others to guide the
-system as a whole. Communism, by
contrast, attempted to bring all the in-
formation to a large and powerful cen-
tral processor, which collapsed when it
was overwhelmed by ever more com-
plex information.

Computers are providing people all
over the U.S. with the ability to process
information and to use their creativity
to challenge the world around them in
ways never before imagined. More and
more, computers are replacing tele-
phones; more and more, computers are
able to communicate as well as calcu-
late. To realize the full benefit of the
information age, we need to take the
next step: high-speed networks must
be built that tie together millions of
computers, providing capabilities that
we cannot even imagine. Consider su-
percomputers. Although they are far
more valuable than their weaker pre-
decessors, they cannot be effectively
linked together over existing networks.

In laboratories across our country,
scientists and researchers armed with
powerful supercomputers are using
them to design more effective medi-
cines, safer aircraft and automobiles
and more efficient products. Scientists
studying the earth's environment can
produce complex climate models to
help understand global warming and
other critical atmospheric trends.

Suppose that we had a national "co-
laboratory" linking teams at different
geographic locations so that research-
ers could work together on projects in-
volving computational science. Suppose
that a scientist or an engineer design-
ing a product could immediately trans-
fer a design to the manufacturer, who
in turn could transfer it instantly to
computer-operated machines ready to
turn the idea into reality. The benefits,
both intellectual and economic, would
be phenomenal.

There have been advances in network-
ing technology. We have the technical
know-how to make networks that would
enable a child to come home from
school and, instead of playing Nintendo,
use something that looks like a video
game machine to plug into the Library
of Congress. It could be possible to gain
access to the most powerful supercom-
puters in our nation from every PC in
AmericaQand to gain access to digital
libraries, another key part of the nation-
al information infrastructure we need.

It used to be that a nation's trans-
portation infrastructure determined
success in international economic com-
petition. Nations with deep-water ports
did better than nations unable to ex-
ploit the technology of ocean trans-
portation. Canals, railroads, highways,
water and sewer systemsQthe list is a
long oneQwere infrastructure invest-
ments found, through experience, to
provide tremendous leverage for im-
proving a nation's competitiveness.

Today transportation is less impor-
tant compared with other factors, such
as the ability to move information and
to increase the value of this informa-
tion. At the same time, however, we are
confronted with massive and rapidk
multiplying quantities of information.
We are forced to deal with what I call
"exformation"Qaccumulated surpluses
of data that we know exist but are out-
side our conscious awareness.

Fields of specialization are becommg
narrower and narrower as the amount
of information continues to explode,
doubling every six months in some dis-
ciplines. In a sense, we have automated
the process of gathering information
without enhancing our ability to absorb
its meaning.

Our current national information pol-
icy resembles the worst aspects of our
old agricultural policy, which left grain
rotting m thousands of storage silos
while people were starving. We have
warehouses of unused mformation "rot-
ting," while critical questions are left
unanswered and critical problems are
left unsolved. For example, the Landsat
satellite is capable of taking a complete
photograph of the entire earth's surface
every two weeks. It has been operating
for nearly 20 years. Yet more than 95
percent of those images, which might
be invaluable to farmers, environmen-
tal scientists, geologists, educators, city
planners and busmesses, have never
been seen by human eyes.

Luckily, just as we confront this fan-
tastic problem of so-called exforma-
tion, all these silos filled with "rotting
data," we see the appearance of the su-
percomputer. These machines promise
the ability to configure or organize in-
formation into a form easy for us to
absorb. They can search through vast
fields of data to find those bits that
have special relevance at the moment.

But first we must build a way to use
it effectively. Typically, software de-
velopment follows hardware develop-
ment, and policy lags behind both. Yet
it is policy that can determine whether
we reap the benefits of this new tech-
nology. In too many cases, we have
mastered the technology but failed to
muster the political commitment and
the appropriate policies.

Federal policies can make a differ-
ence in several key areas of the com-
puter revolution. The U. S. Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA), the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the National Sci-
ence Foundation and the Department
of Energy have all spent millions of
dollars developing the next generation
of supercomputers. It is safe to say
that without federal seed money, Cray
Research and otber American firms
would not now dominate the world
market for supercomputers.

The funds from those agencies have
also built today's research computer
networks, such as NSFNET, and under-
written the development of software
for top-of-the-line machines. Additional
federal research funding is also needed
to develop easy-to-use applications for
supercomputers and networks (espe-
cially in mdustry and medicine) and
to tram people in computational sci-
ence. The massive amounts of data in
our information silos, much of it in
electronic form, could be made avail-
able to researchers over networks. But
resources are needed to put the data in
a useful format and to catalogue and
distribute them.

Most important, we need a com-
mitment to build the high-
speed data highways. Their ab-
sence constitutes the largest single bar-
rier to realizing the potential of the
information age. Present policy, which
is based on copper-wire networks, is
hindermg deployment of the new fiber
technology. There is a policy gridlockQ
some say a "graphic jam"Qbecause the
interests that built and still run our ex-
isting infrastructure resist changes that
might intensify competition.

Other countries, including not only
advanced nations such as Japan and
Germany but also many countries in
the developing world that are just now
building a universal telephone system,
do not have this problem. If we do not
break the communications gridlock, our
foreign competitors could once again
reap the benefits of U.S. technology
while we remain mired in the past.

The most effective way to break the
stalemate would be to show the Ameri-
can people what fiber-optic networks
could offer them. Most Americans are
only vaguely familiar with even existing
networks, yet they rely on networks
every day. Everyone, from shoppers at
the checkout counter to consumers
making a withdrawal from an automat-
ed teller machine, is dealing with a com-
puter through a network.

Thousands of researchers now use
megabit-per-second networks to com-
municate with computers a continent
away. A few hundred people, exempli-
fied by Robert E. Kahn, president of
the Corporation for National Research
Initiatives, are building even faster,
gigabit networks to link supercomput-
ers, allowing two, three or more super-
computers to work together as one.

Slower networks that operate at 45
megabits a second or less, like NSFNET,
are being used by more than half a
million researchers, educators and stu-
dents at colleges, universities and fed-
eral and private laboratories to commu-
nicate with their colleagues, to access
data bases and to collect data from
remote instruments. Several high-tech
enterprises, such as IBM and AT&T Bell
Laboratories, also depend on such net-
works. Banks and other financial insti-
tutions, many factories and other busi-
nesses now rely on networks that oper-
ate in the range of 50,000 to 100,000
bits per second to exchange electronic
mail, financial transactions, stock quo-
tations and other types of information.

Services like Prodigy, GEnie and Com-
puServe are now in use in almost half a
million homes. Children can use "elec-
tronic encyclopedias" to finish their
term papers, and their parents can
keep up with the news, check bank
balances and get consumer tips. Hun-
dreds of schools are linked by low-
speed (1,200- or 2,400-bit-per-second)
networks, such as Kids' Net, that allow
students to exchange electronic mail.

Networks thousands or even mil-
lions of times faster would offer
greater benefits. Today a child
can go to a library and use a computer
to get the title of a book. A faster net-
work would bring the book to the child
at home, pictures and all. But how do
we get there? It is estimated that more
than $100 billion of private invest-
ment would be needed to connect op-
tical fiber to every home, office, facto-
ry, school, library and hospital. Unfor-
tunately, the onslaught of technology
is causing fierce competition between
once separate entities in telecommuni-
cations. The telephone companies want
to transmit entertainment; the cable
carriers are asking to get into the com-
munications business. And businesses
are turning to satellite communications
carriers or installing private fiber-optic
networks.

All are regulated by vague, outdated,
conflicting, constantly changing gov-
ernment telecommunications policies.
The result is that the private sector
hesitates to jump in and make the in-
vestment. We face the classic "chicken
and egg" dilemma. Because there is no
network, there is no apparent demand
for the network; because there is no
demand, there is no network.

Consider the interstate highway sys-
tem. It made sense for a postwar Amer-
ica with lots of new automobiles clog-
ging crooked, two-lane roads. But who
was going to pay for it? There was no
private business that could afford it
and no entrepreneur convinced it was
worth it. Similarly, the private sector
cannot afford to build the high-speed
computer network we need and may
not even be convinced of its value.

But, like the interstate highway sys-
tem, once this network is completed
the demand for its use will skyrocket.
We are already seeing private and pub-
lic concerns building feeder networks
that, just as state roads feed into the
interstate highways, could make the net-
work more effective. More than 2,000
separate networks make up the Inter-
net, the largest national research net-
work. The amount of traffic is growing
at the rate of 10 percent a month.

For almost 15 years, I have been
working to change federal policy so that
as a nation we will invest in the criti-
cal infrastructure of information super-
highways. I have fought for funding for
the Internet and its successor, the Na-
tional Research and Education Network
(NREN), which will be almost 100 times
faster. Its development costs, about
$390 million in federal funds over the
next five years, represent less than 1
percent of federal research and devel-
opment expenditures, yet this network
could greatly enhance the productivi-
ty and value of the other 99 percent
of the research and education dollars
we spend.

The national network represents a
demonstration project that should build
public support and influence public
policy. I see it as an electronic battering
ram to knock down obsolete policies
and outdated skepticism. Already the
national network as an idea is serv-
ing as a catalyst for action by schools
and universities, businesses and re-
search centers and even state and local
governments.

Adequate federal investment and
leadership will give us the power to
leverage the millions of dollars into
something greater than the sum of its
parts. Federal leadership is needed to
provide direction and coordination. Fed-
eral dollars represent an initial, rather
than an ongoing, investment, intended
to spark the development that will cre-
ate the demand for this network as a
commercial enterprise.

The "demonstration effect" of the
national network will rapidly develop
enormous demand for the new infor-
mation services its high capacity will
make possible. It will link the humdreds
of computer networks, operated by
state and local governments, nonprofit
and for-profit corporations, universi-
ties and others, to a federally funded
"backbone," capable of transmitting
billions of bits of data per second.

Without federal funding for this na-
tional network, we would end up with
- a balkanized system, consisting of doz-
ens of incompatible parts. The strength
of the national network is that it will
not be controlled or run by a single en-
tity. Hundreds of different players will
be able to connect their own networks
to this one.

The potential benefits of a high
speed network are so obvious and so
great that a strong, broad coalition has
formed in support. The research and
education community, the telecommu-
nications mdustry, the computer indus-
try and other high-tech industries are
all enthusiastic.

But although there is much agree-
ment on the need for the national net-
work, there is still controversy over the
next step, the creation of a commercial,
ubiquitous, fiber-optic system that can
reach into almost every American home.
Various sectors of the communications
industryQthe long-distance telephone
companies, the regional Bell operating
companies, the cable companiesQeach
want a central role.

It will be up to federal and state pol-
icymakers to determine how best to
build a universal, high-speed network,
to reconcile the competing corporate
interests and to create a network that
maximizes the benefits enjoyed by all
Americans. Given the pace at which
networking technology is changing, our
efforts will demand more than just vi-
sion, leadership and commitment. Flex-
ibility and a willingness to change the
details of the plan while constantly
moving forward will be required.

Building the national network will be
only the first step. That done, we could
focus on a telecommunications policy
that would resolve the telephone-cable
debate, decide what the Baby Bells can
and cannot do and confront the chal-
lenge presented by other telecommuni-
cations issues. We cannot afford to re-
main deadlocked. The alternative is to
wait until other nations show us how
to take advantage of this technologyQ
and they will. We must move first.

Currently the only store that has it in stock is BPM Records in San Francisco 
(on Polk, between Post and Sutter).

I believe it will also be on sale at Alternity.

If you're not into vinyl, different mixes of "The Trip" will be appearing on

Subject: Introducing Rhythmos

 
As many people on this list know, the first issue of Rhythmos
hit the streets a few weeks ago.  I have found the spirit and 
intent of the magazine's founders to be very much in sync with 
that of the SFRAVES community.  In fact, some members of this 
list are active contributers to Rhythmos. The magazine is filled
a conglomeration of articles on technology, science, health, 
poetry, life in the Bay Area, cartoons, art, etc.  The contributors
and founders are nonprofessional locals giving the magazine, with
all of its typos and grammatical liberties, an honesty that makes
it read lke a community forum, similar to SFRAVES.  Right now, Rhythmos 
is struggling to break even through local advertising revenue.  
It sells for 1$, but most issues have been given away free.  I 
think it is a venture worthy of our support, so if you see it 
being sold (around the Haight and hopefully soon in Berkeley), 
buy a copy.  Below is the editorial page from the first issue.  
I think it gives a general idea of where the founders are coming 
from.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhythmos is an idea born to help a youth culture grow into a solid 
community able to help itself and others by providing an open forum 
for thoughts, ideas, hopes, and dreams.  We hope to encourage creativity, 
consideration for one another, and understanding that the earth is our 
home; and our home is a place to respect, not abuse and destroy.
 
A Note To The Community
 
Now that the rave scene has established itself as a viable part of the 
entertainment scene here in S.F. and the Bay Area, we must begin to look 
at our motives for throwing parties.  It seems that there is an 
increasing number of folks who have found the joy of the quick buck in a 
large party.  This attitude is counter productive and will eventually 
lead to a whole host of problems for party makersand goers.  The rave 
scene and all its trappings provide the present youth culture a new 
window of opportunity for growth in spirituality and community.  Abusing
peoples' good faith and trust by throwing parties that are not of the 
highest quality, promoters are in fact taking good creative energy and 
wasting it for the sake of money.
 
It is up to the community at large to demand the highest quality in 
house parties and accept nothing less.  Only a party that has been 
organized with concern for peoples' comfort and health can bring out the 
essential spirit that resides in us all and let that spirit climb free 
to explore and discover in the various realms of consciousness.  
Promoters must understand that people are consciously or unconsciously 
entrusting their bodies, minds and spirits in the good taste and judgement
of the promoter.  This is a responsibility that we should not take lightly 
and understand when plans are being made for a party.  So once again if 
you are going to throw a party or just going to a party bear in mind that 
everyone deserves to be turned on to an experience of great beauty and 
unity.  With love and understanding anything we attempt is possible.
                                Enjoy, Ammon and T

hmm... good question...
with hopefully a good answer

to me the rave scene really isnt about dancing all night long
that's just what happens there, its something that brings
the people together but it is not wholly what they are there for

if i wanted to dance all night long, i could do so at my apartment
with a lot of the same music, but it would feel pretty pointless
if i was just there by myself, sooo...
if i invited friends over, then a bunch of us could hang out all night long
if we did this every weekend and even sometimes during the week
we would probably get to know each other somewhat

now lets say we all took E every time we got together..
well then we would probably, _really_ get to know each other
or at least be really friendly with each other,
and it wouldnt be acting or faking it, although it might
be drug induced...

after a month or so of this, we would become great friends
and wouldnt really care about the music, but would
just want to hang out together, but dancing is always fun
(esp while under the influence of some drugs)

now if i had just been dancing by myself all night long
then i probably would have stopped after a week or two
if even that, and if some casual friends had just come over,
then they probably would not keep going after awhile

but if people come over and we become close and feel like
we are a 'family' then they will come back week after week

now why just limit yourselves to people you know,
why not try to meet new people, so just invite random 
people to come up and dance
well, it would make more sense if they liked the same music
so why not go to stores that sell mostly that kind of music
and invite the customers of those stores

now these people you dont know come and they either like it or they dont
hopefully if they dont, they dont come back the next week
but with those that like it why do they like it?
some like it just for the music, they will come back and 
dance in the corner by themselves and might keep coming back
or maybe not, but they stick mostly to themselves and 
arent really a bother to anyone
then there are some that just love the family feeling that seems to
be with the group of people who were there in the beginning
and they want to join that, and the original people want to spread that
feeling, so they just expand and make a larger family..

now as some drug use gets more prevalent, the people become 
closer and some of the dancers off in the corner get adopted
and people love each other not because they want to have sex with them
not because they are 'cool' and it will look good to go out with them
but because they do and thats just the way it is

people have been dancing for a long time in clubs and they 
are meat markets and they determine who is cool and who is not
and they are focused around alcohol and getting laid
hell if 10,000 people want to get together and dance until dawn
in a huge warehouse full of lasers and stuff like that
then they should go for it, but why anyone would choose that
over 100 people dancing in some basement or field where everyone
is friendly and accepting of you, now that i dont know

 ,
dana

ps i realize that you dont need drugs to become friends with people
but they often help, especially when you are dealing with
really random strangers off the street, 
_they are not necesary though_

pps in regards to what i just said, i was thinking about this
yesterday or the day before, and (boy am i gonna get shit for this)
i really think that one of the biggest problems with raves
is that not enough people are on drugs, specifically E,
it really does create an atmosphere of love and friendship
among total strangers and that is what is needed

I think that Dana has hit the nail on the head.  I'd much rather be with a
small group of people who are interested inbecoming friends with each other
than in among 10,000 people who rarely even acknowledge each other's
presence.  For me, the joy of raving is establishing connections and making
new friends-finding out how my life resonates with others.  The coolest
thing that ever happened to me at a rave was being tapped on the shoulder
and asked, Hey, man, would you mind giving me a hug?  E helps, tho I also
agree that it it NOT a sine qua non for having a good time.
Apologies to all for not quoting from Dana's message.  I haven't yet gotten
a good off-line reader-any and all suggestions greatly appreciated.  I guess
apologies are also in order for not remaining a lurker for the first couple
of weeks on SFRaves, but I love the scene too much not to get involved.
Hope to meet up with you guys at Alternity.

If I were you I'd be hiding my stash right now :)

Anyway, I think I understand what you're saying.  I think people need to be
in that _mindset_.  It is possible to get into that _mindset_ without the
use of E, certainly, and it's also possible to get yourself into that
mindset having only taken it once.  I know people who have done both of
those things, lots of people, and at a rave you wouldn't be able to tell if
they were on X or not!  (In fact I'm often asked if I'm on it on nights 
when I'm comnpletely clean!)

So let's rephrase you statement.  I think (we think?) people should be more 
open to that mindset that X brings about.  

My personal feeling, of course, is that you should try everything once...

Rhythmos is looking for someone to do reviews of raves on a continuing basis.
The concept they are currently toying with is a Siskel & Ebert type of column, 
where one reviewer is a 'bridge & tunnel' Toontown type of attendee, and the 
other is a hardcore underground raver.  The Siskel & Ebert rave reviewers would be fictionalized characters that represent extreme (and hopefully humorous) 
perspectives on rave events in the bay area.  Which is not to say that they 
won't be informative about things like what to expect from certain promoters, 
DJ's, locations etc.  A few reviews per issue would probably suffice.  There is no pay, just the chance to participate, and you can remain anonymous if you 
wish.

Subject: 48 Hour(s) Trip

Hello all-

I would like to preface this entire message with the following maxim:

Every problem is an opportunity (and vice versa).

So check this out--

Last night, I went to USF to help out with the latest incarnation of
Timothy Leary's "Brain-X-Change", a seminar on "electronic mind expansion"
featuring the good Dr. Leary, Genesis & Alaura P-Orridge from Psychic TV,
and Andy & Dave from Hyperdelic Video. The seminar consisted of about an
hour of Dr. Leary rapping about the hyptonic and hypnogogic properties of
audio-visual media like television. While he spoke, extremely rapidly
edited video produced by the Hyperdelic boys was projected on two large
video screens behind him. The P-Orridges supplied the soundtrack, a
combination of various tape loops designed to enhance the trance-inducing
effect. (If you'd like more details about the event itself, send me email,
or see a wonderful review posted by AstroBoy a few months ago--it's in the
archives...)

Anyway, the show was recorded by a crew from the CBS television program
_48_Hours_. They are in town for another week or so, working on an episode
about LSD.

During the course of our discussions with the producer, the issue of raves
was (inevitably) raised. I told her about how the scene has evolved over
the past 18 months or so, and also about sfraves. She was very interested
in both the computer and community aspects of sfraves. Indeed, we are
getting togther later today so I can explain a bit about how email works,
and how sfraves has evolved.

Since the crew wanted to check out a rave anyway, I suggested that they
might be able to come to Alternity on Fryday. I also said that I would
first have to propose the idea to the list, and that regardless of whether
we allowed them into the rave with a camera, people would be able to refuse
interviews and TV exposure on an individual basis.

So what do you all think? On one hand, I think it could be a great
opportunity to make certain that the rave scene is portrayed positively
(for once) in the national media. On the other hand, it is possible that
footage they collect could be edited in such a way as to completely subvert
our intentions (anyone see 90210 last week?).

My gut reaction is to let them come, and to portray the scene as honestly
(and favorably) as possible. I think sfraves is a unique community, and
represents an interesting glimpse of the potential of computers to bring
people together.

However, every opportunity is (potentially) a problem...

Logistically, I don't think their presence will affect Alternity much.
Everyone will be warned in advance, so they can avoid being interviewed if
they so desire. The crew have agreed to use only a small Hi-8 camera and no
lights, so disruption of the "rave vibe" per se should not be an issue.

Feel free to respond to me directly of you have specific questions...

I don't see how that would be a problem. After all, they can come with
or without _your_ permission.

My question is about the seminar. How did you hear about it. I'm wondering
how I missed it. 

We should all post announcements about events like this! Perhaps this 
was posted and I just missed it.

The "drug" is just to help take away the inhibitions. Alcohol, pots,
 E, etc does pretty much that with different emphasis, I have heard
the "I wouldn't normally do this, but I was so wasted" so many times.
 Once you have lost the inhibition( getting tattooed, going to a
 nudist beach, hugging strangers, etc), you don't really need the "drug"
anymore to do the same thing.

i think it's a great idea.  however, i am wondering why you brought
this up to the whole list.  it's not a democracy.  it's not even the
semblance of a democracy.  somebody like me who spends his whole work
day sitting at a terminal has a much louder voice, in list terms, than
someone who logs in from a 1200 baud modem once a day.

besides, what if someone *does* think it's a bad idea?  do we tell
them, "sorry, you can't come in"?  assuming we wanted to do that, is
it even *legal*?  (as the subgenii are fond of saying, "you may be

i was going to throw the line about having used it once in

just in the right mindset, and i think that being on
drugs once would help out a lot of people
some of them need it more

My opinion: I object to 48 hrs being invited to Alternity (or any other
rave) and negatively-associating "rave" with "LSD". You can try to endear
them to the notion of community, of getting back to tribal roots, but all
that is going to end up on the cutting room floor (/dev/null in the digital
age) because they have sensationalistic journalism as their goal.

48 hrs is not KPIX doing a fluff-piece on "Let Freedom Rave" -- they've got
to please a large constituency of Christian Midwesterners whose
self-righteousness needs to be reaffirmed, not challenged.

I cannot imagine they'll be allowed to do any kind of positive portrayal
(or even a non-judgemental portrayal of the issues from both sides).

I've seen 48 hours episodes before and they are full of sensationalistic,
heart-string-pulling pseudo-journalistic media hype. Remember, there's a
war on drugs to be fought. Also, note all the recent stories in papers/tv
about the reemergence of LSD amongst high-schoolers. How timely/trendy of
48 hours to decide to tell Amerikkka the TRVTH (*) about what is really
going on.

When it airs on TV, don't be surprised when they splice Jonathan's head on
top of someone else's body as they show you doing a ritualistic LSD-killing
of a litter of cute, fuzzy, cuddly 1-week-old kittens while chanting
mantra-like "DON'T DRINK THEE WATER. ALL-IN-ONE-GOD-FAITH DILUTE! DILUTE!
OK?"

So if you do find yourself on being filmed by the 48hrs crue, don't drop 10
hits of liquid and have an acid-spaz on TV, ok? And keep yer yammerings
about how each dead kitten further coalesces the universal collective
unconscious to yerself. :-)

In other words... I think it would be nice if 48 hrs stayed away from
Alternity. I for one don't like my face appearing on TV. I want to be free
to be me!

PS: (*) TRVTH is the special beaureaucratic way the US government spells
"truth" on the buildings in DC (roman stylee)... It is actually a
completely different word that is synonymous with "dupe" "lie" "dominate",
and "cheat".

TAXI here,

I'm prejudiced when I believe that media for the masses is very conservative.
But that's what I believe.  Now EVERYONE knows that LSD is illegal.  Whether or
not 48 hours shows Alternity, raving, drugs in a positive or negative light
it's still against what the law-writers in this country have set down.  That 
just means it's PLAIN illegal.  If 48 hours does a piece on acid and SF and 
Alternity and raves then I have a feeling they'll ALL be "guilty by 
association" whether we like it or not.  I believe that if 48 hours airs with
info about SF, and acid and raving - it'll probably be a few weeks before the
law-enforcers crack down HARD on acid peddlers and maybe even raves.  Are we
really aware of what "bad" national media attention can do to a city's 
law-enforcers?  Even good media attention on something that is illegal (LSD)
is bad media attention in my opinion.  IF only liberal people and young 
folks who don't care watched 48 hours there wouldn't be a problem in my 
opinion.  But old conservative people who seem to have nothing better to 
do than to restrict other people's freedoms will also be watching.  In my 
opinion, no mass media attention is always better than some mass media 
attention when it comes to matters like these.  If the 48 hour crew comes to
Alternity, I'll still go but I sure will NOT consider it a psychological 
sanctuary.  If the 48 hour crew came to party and have fun, I wouldn't mind
but we all know they have a show they have to do.

        I would also tend to stay away from this. The press today is
already sensationalistic enough, and I think it would be wise to stay away
from this. This show is about ACID. Therefore, most likely it will be a
piece on the resurgence of the drug among our "young people," and will have
very little if anything to do with the scene itself. 
	48 Hours in particular is one of those not-quite-so-serious news
shows that the big networks have created to compete with sensationalist
trash like "A Current Affair." It is intended to be much more pandering than
shows like 60 Minutes, and is nothing more than infotainment, not news. Even
if the producer likes what s/he sees, and films Alternity, this is what is
likely to happen:
	We (and the camera crew) would see a fairly close-knit community of
computer students, professionals, afficionados, and the like. They would see
us as a bunch of friends and acquaintances who like to listen to techno
music under cool lightning and dance all night. This, you must remember, is
generally how we percieve ourselves.
	This perception will disappear the second the film hits the editing
room. The people there will see a bunch of young hippie-wannabes in bright
clothes writhing all night to unbearable noise (NOT music) under
neo-psychedelic videos and lightning. All this will basically reinforce the
idea that the entire scene is just a rehash of the 60s, complete with flower
power and drugs (especially drugs).
	Even if they see NO drugs, no alcohol, no nothing, it will be
EXTREMELY difficult to have the entire scene shown in anything but a
negative light. Remember, this show is about acid. If they cannot show some
correlation between the rave scene and drugs, they will not show it, and
will instead cut to a clip of some alienated 15-year-old from Tulsa who
killed himself while listening to Alice Cooper, while he was also on acid.
They will make NO attempt to make this factual. It will just be another one
of those "wild, drug-crazed San Francisco hippie computer hacker parties" to
the people in corporate headquarters and, if we make it past the cutting
room, this is all that will be broadcast.

I think we need and can afford some honest--and not
danderous--talk.  In the spirit of "The truth will set
you free, but first it will probably piss you off" I
offer the following:
Hi Phoebe
Yer paragraph:
The "drug" is just to help take away the inhibitions.
Alcohol, pots,
 E, etc does pretty much that with different emphasis, I
have heard
the "I wouldn't normally do this, but I was so wasted" so
many times.
 Once you have lost the inhibition( getting tattooed, going
to a
 nudist beach, hugging strangers, etc), you don't really
need the "drug"
anymore to do the same thing.

My response:
I don't think so.  Based on more than 30 years experience
with the above (all the above except being tattooed) I
think there is a great difference between E and other
"drugs." I'm happy to see that Dana opened this us and
that to some extent it is part of this current rich
discussion about the significance of raves.  I wanna see
more serious talk about it and less casual shrugoffs.
Your comments are NOT the latter but could be construed
as such, I think IM not soHO!
Will
P.S.  While I meant "dangerous," I think "danderous" has
a more headscratching feel to it.

Hey Dana-
Thanks for your words of true wisdom (as opposed to
false wisdom, of course!). One thing that I appreciate
about some of the discussion currently going on in
sfraves is the reflective thinking in pieces such as 
yours.  As someone whose been involved in both education
and psychedelics for over 30 years, I know the truth
of what you say--about the rave scene, about E, and
perhaps most importantly about their context in ex-
periencing our common humanness, the joy and angst,
the weight and lightness of our psychoneurosociospirit-
ual journeying.  You are expressing aspects of the   
ultimately inexpressible, of course, of the realm
where the dance cannot be separated from the dancer.
I'm putting together my own private rave reader from
these postings.  If it comes to be a true reader I'll
ask people's permission, of course, and give them the
opportunity to revise and edit what they sent out at 
first blush.  But one of the proofs of the "suchness"
of where the "rave scene" is now--a rich place where,
say the first US psychedelic dances were (on a similar
spiral) back in '62 in SF at the Trips Festivals--is in
fact the writing, the discussions, the reflections!
Rave on!
Will
P.S. Pardon the misused "whose" (should be "who's"
of course)above and all the rather selfrighteous "trues,"
not to mention "of courses"!

Well, I've watched the discussion and I have mixed views.  I respect
wpenna's opinion cuz "he's been around" and seen it before. But I also
agree with (I can't remember who it was) who said that we weere probibly the
BEST people for 48 hours to talk to.  I think we can play  it a couple of ways.
Whatever we do, WE must be the one manipulaating the media, not the other
way around.  Examples to look at are the YIPPIES (Abbie Hoffman) in their
early days, Jello Biafra (in his latter days) and Frank Zappa, Ice=T etc.
These people get press coverage but basicly come through undiluted.

We need to PLAN what we will say, If interviewed, SERIOUSLY FOLKS.
We have to decide whether we want to give them such a load of shit that
most ravers will know that we hazed them and thus the word will get out that
48 hours got "Ganked" (to use a ghetto  term) and thus we sucessfully
gave the press disinformation, which will be so ludicrous that it won't
hurt things any more then they already are.

We could EMPHASIZE that this IS NOT about drugs, it's about consciousness.
And awareness, things that are lacking or at least on the wane in american
culture.  It's about togetherness and acceptance of different people and cultures, about respect for peoples choices and preferences.  So if we play
this angle and only give them positive insightful sound bite , either they
will not use our footage, (no harm done) or they will be forced to put
some "truth" in.

I believe we should go for the latter, this is harder to do though.
Please, please,please DON'T be dosed when you talk to these people!
It's the  last thing that the scene needs.  Remember, it;s close to election
year.  Also the last thing we need is Jessie Helms watching this shit in NC
and starting to mouth off about the "devil worship" going on in San Francisco.

distortions, you also get the BIG LIE, followed in due course by an apology
for the misrepresentation.  As an occifer of the court, I for one have no
intention of discussing any involvement with any possibly illegal activities
with anyone, especially a CBS crew.  And you can bet that mention of drugs
will far outweigh any discussion of consciousness; in fact, the drugs will

There was a heavily played story on NBC nightly news earlier this week
about 11 kids being suspended in some Atlanta public school for LSD, which
segued into a big scare piece on the drug.  By heavily played, I mean
a five-minute story about five-minutes into the broadcast.

Why on earth would we want Alternity and SFRaves associated so strongly
with the main subject matter of this report?  After all of our efforts

IMHO, this is perhaps the point of it all. ah yes, another lurker and
intermittnet helper speaks. nonetheless; sometimes you need to use
vehicles to get to a place you will later walk to. you could even walk
there. it may take longer (it may, infact, be the _wrong_ place for

Anyway, the show was recorded by a crew from the CBS television program
_48_Hours_. They are in town for another week or so, working on an episode
about LSD.

During the course of our discussions with the producer, the issue of raves
was (inevitably) raised. I told her about how the scene has evolved over
the past 18 months or so, and also about sfraves. She was very interested
in both the computer and community aspects of sfraves. Indeed, we are
getting togther later today so I can explain a bit about how email works,
and how sfraves has evolved.



..........Gee, maybe you can explain how she can subscribe to sfraves while
your at it.  She's probably "very interested" in knowing more about all the 
progressive high tech companies and educational institutions and misc. indi-
viduals represented here, not to mention the weekly calendar.......

Ummm. Like the rave scene is really "underground" anymore now that you can
find flyers for every big rave in most any haight-street store and posters
for toontown on the kiosks.

Like didn't y'all see the cover-story articles on raving in the SF Weekly
or Bay Guardian back in February?? Like y'all didn't see the various TV
reportage of raving?

It's old news!

The thing to do is to become friends/friendly w/ the reporters so that they
feel invited into the scene, rather than the feeling of being an
observer/alien/outsider -- unless they've got deep-rooted phobias against
technno/disco/house/dancing, they'll probably end up seeing something
positive about it and writing positive articles. Any journalist knows the
power of omitting a few unecessary details in order to help a cause.

Ooops... and I just put a NYC-based guy that writes for Option Magazine
(friend of my sister & her-husband & his-sister) in touch w/ a bunch of
ravers because he's writing an article on the "SF rave scene" for that mag.
(He was at the FMR too! ... I've also told him about Connection).

(I also took my 33-yr-old sister and her husband (visiting from NYC) to the
FMR -- it was their first rave ever, and they liked it alot. They were
especially glad they saw what the place and the people looked like in the
light after sunrise.)

I'm looking for people who would like to write about rave/techno

the philosophical/political/cultural issues surrounding it.
My goal to to assemble a 100% freelanced e-mail journal, which
will be distributed through a) A small direct-distribution
subscription list; and b) Via sfraves and other established
lists (such as Technoculture, aka TNC). There will be no money
in it, only the pleasure of writing -- if we get enough of a
'critical mass' together, I'm hoping we can get promo copies
of records for review purposes.

I've enjoyed reading the posts to sfraves -- as well as browsing
the archives -- and I hope that a journal might help dis-
tribute information (as opposed to mass-media disinformation)
around the country.

Well, before we make too many assumptions, we need to find out from
Jonathan what their angle really is.  If it's mainly a piece about
Timothy Leary and PTV and HDV, then we'll be in good company, and
it can't be too bad; on the other hand, if it is a story about   
"DRUGS in our schools and how the EVIL Mr.Leary is pushing it",
then there's a problem.  

I assume that since Jonathan and the other guys spoke to them, that
either they're OK, or they're extremely devious, although there is
still the possibility of a massive information warp once it gets   
into the CBS Corp. offices...  Then again, they might do a great
piece, and all that middle america will see is "DRUGS!" and  
remember that Nancy Reagan told them that "DRUGS ARE BAD" and 
forget the rest of the piece, and walk away thinking "AMERICA
NEEDS MORE FAMILY VALUES"

It really doesn't matter what the particular press venue is -- it's
almost always a mistake to "talk" to them unless you know who you're
talking to well, you have a spin doctor on retainer, or you have a
handle on who's doing the reporting.  There's no telling what they'll
do.  Even innocuous stuff can be misinterpreted, deliberately mangled,
or simply changed to fit somebody else's agenda.  I've based my
opinion mostly on the way the press & LBL interacted during Cliff
Stoll's career & the Morris Worm internet fiasco, one of the rare
times I could watch the interaction up close but without any personal
involvment.

I've never seen 48 Hours, but I was always under the impression that it was one
of those shows where they follow cops around for a couple days hoping to get
some gorey footage.  (Like the show Cops, which I have also never seen.)  If
that's the case, then won't this whole piece be to set the stage in order to
show how pervasive drugs are in the scene in order to justify the WAR ON DRVGS?
Are they going to have cops in tow behind the camera crew?  Or will they just
send the cops in at 5:00 am, after all the stage-setting has been done and then
film all the arrests?

Hope I'm off base here.

By the way, there is a big FREE parking lot one block away on Harrison

only check in the afternoon. To park with a free conscious you can
stuff $2 in a little box. It's called "Metro Park".

Hey, there's nothing wrong with a few little white lies.  Back in May,
I was at the second Equinox rave, and it got busted.  I was in one of
those *extremely* friendly states, and I started talking to one of the
cops.  He was a guy in his mid twenties, and this was the second
weekend of the LA riots, and he was telling me that all the officers were
working 12-hour days, 7 days a week, and that there was a lot of tension
in the air, and I felt bad that he had to be in the situation he was in.
But regardless of the extremely open state of mind I was in, there was no
way in hell I was going to tell him that anything illegal was going on in
the rave.  He asked me in a conversational way if there was a bar inside,
and I (truthfully) said that there wasn't one.  He didn't ask me about drug
use, but if he had I would have lied through my teeth and told him that
I wasn't aware of any.

	Terrific idea!  That reminds me of a video piece produced by Buffalo,
NY's 8mm News Collective about the construction of television news (Yup,
there's a lot of "construction").  Anyway, the idea was to follow TV newspeople
around to see how they operated.  The video begins with a fantasy journey to
the "land where the news comes from" (INSERT APPROPRIATE HARP SFX).  The
collective picked Buffalo's WKBW (ch7) as their subject of interest.  The news
crews thought the group's presence was cute at first, then they began to get
annoyed.  There's one scene where the two factions stare each other down with
their cameras running, posed as if for a wild west gunfight.  Eventually,  the
piece ends with the collective being hassled by the Buffalo P.D.  when they
head for the receptionist's desk at the front door of the Channel 7 offices,
supposedly in violation of a restraining order of which they were never
informed.  The final message:  they can't take what they dish out!

	Anyway, here's a few suggestions:

	1)  Bring your video cameras 'n bring directional mics if you can. 
Get as much of the crew's offhand remarks as possible.  Maybe even hide a
camera.  (It would be a good idea to call the organizers to make sure they know
what you're doing.)

	2)  Interview the crew!  

	2a)  Make your own video assessment of the rave scene.

	3)  For Bob's sake, record the _48 Hours_ article when it airs.

	4)  Find someone who can get access to an editing system.

	5)  Submit the resulting piece in festivals such as Buffalo's _Video
Witnesses_ festival, sponsored by Hallwalls gallery.  I can get an address for
anyone interested.

	Good luck, kids!  Make sure you take advantage of the situation.  Wish
I could be there to help.

    local independent bay area video group (that we know well) produce
    a report on "the scene".

2.  Come on!  Not everyone at Alternity will have read the last 2 days
    of sfraves posts.  We will have little or zero control of who and what
    the CBS crew records, and how they edit it.

Another opinion:  I think it's a bad idea to have the media come in.  We
all know that drugs are involved in raves and we all know that drugs are
illegal in this country.  The last thing that needs to happen is for
it to get out that drug use is common in raves; that could mean their
end and/or the presence of undercover cops at raves.  I say the media

is more likely than not to portray the rave scene in a negative light
and so should not be there.
There is so much love and community and understanding at raves, lets keep
it among those of us who focus on this.
Kindness,
Susie

I have been to many shows where there are cameras (to film the performers),

This is the first time I am (considering) going to an event where
the crowd is getting filmed. It makes me nervous (Stage Fright :) ),
and feel like I have to be on my best behaviour, which is the
 last thing I want to do at a rave.
But imagine your (conservative) relatives and professional collegues
seeing your face on national TV rolling around with a bunch of people
looking high while the sound bite talks about Drugs
 and the decay of family values.
I don't think I can live that down easily.
I am getting enough crap from my non-raver friends already.
Any lawyers out there know if they need to have your permission before
they put you on the box?
If I didn't know about the film crew, I wouldn't be so nervous, but I am
 glad that I have been warned.
If there won't be camera there, please ignore my ramblings.

Subject: Re: CALL OFF ALTERNITY

This was the reply I made last night to Will's message, which I accidentally
sent just to him rather than to the list in general.  My attitudes have
changed slightly since then.  My revised outlook will be made tonight after
I talk with Kathleen, the producer.

My intent now is to let the reporters into Alternity, but as for cameras,
only allow them to ask people if they want to be interviewed, and to 
interview them outside or at a later date.  No one will be on national
TV who doesn't want to be.  I will allow the cameras to take shots of
the DJ, the visuals, etc, but not on the crowds in general.

One thing we should remember:  we can't control who finds out about raves
and who doesn't.  As many people have said, the mass media is bound to find
out about it.  That doesn't mean we should be welcoming them with open
arms, but think about this:  what got the raves shut down in England was the
fact that the media hooked into them, that disinformation was spread around,
and there was basically no one from the rave community who was willing to
stand up and dispute these rumors.  So the rave community thought they could
just ignore the media and it would go away.  Believe me, I would like to
ignore 48 Hours is if I knew their intent was cast a dark image on raves.
But as others have noticed, we have a _real_ opportunity here.

Regardless, their presence at Alternity will be muted at best - no filming
will be allowed other than what I mentioned above, and like I say below,
chances are they'll probably peter out around 3 anyways.  It should in no
way keep us from having a marvelous time, and please don't let it scare
you into not attending.

	Brian


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternity will _not_ be called off.  Period.  

As soon as I can more clearly devine their intentions (I got a call from the
producer tonight) I will post to the list.  I will tell you all right now
that this list means much more to me (and the rest of you out there) than
appearing on any national TV show would, specially something with a 
hatchet-job-history like 48 Hours.  I am _not_ thrilled in the slightest
that the main topic of the report is on lsd, and we are considered a 
corrolary to that.  I will _not_ be appearing on national TV expressing
any views on LSD.  I've got too much of a future to worry about doing  
something like that.  The ideal setup is, of course, that we show a 
positive front much the way KPIX did with Let Freedom Rave.

I would go on camera saying that I think the percentage of people at
raves on intoxicating substances is _less_ than what I see at frat
and co-op parties.

So they go to Alternity.  One of two things happens:

One: They go there at the beginning.  They introduce themselves to people.
They keep a low profile.  People are friendly with them. They take a few
pictures of the pretty visuals.  They get bored around 4, and leave.  No
problem.  If they figure at that point that they have to invent a story,
they really won't have much to go on that would implicate SFRaves.


Two:  They go there at the beginning.  They introduce themselves to people.
They start talking to more and more people, and maybe they start understanding
what a rave can be all about, about what is essentially an extended family
coming together a couple of times a week (more or less), they start getting
in tune to the rave ideals.  The next day, someone hands them a copy of 
Rhythmos, maybe Jonathan shows them a couple archived posts from SFRaves 
showing the aspect of community.  Maybe they start getting a clue.
                                                            
           

Yes, this is optimistic.  Somebody shoot me.

But I think this is maybe our chance to express to the media how we feel the
rave scene is.  If we play our cards right, I think this is a real opportunity.

I'll find out much more tomorrow about what they have in mind.  I will _not_
let my ego or anyone else's ego play a part in this.  At one point tonight
I was considering calling home and saying, "Guess what, mom! I'm gonna be
on 48 Hours!" and then I realized how utterly foolish that mindset was.  That's
exactly what they want, because that makes it easy to exploit us.

Look gang, let's not let paranoia sweep over us.  It has before, and I think
we've weathered it pretty well without too much trouble. All those arguements
about how the size of the list endangers the concept of small raves is bunk:
Equinox was on the calendar for 2 weeks, and still only 100 people showed up
there.  I think that pretty much shows that we weren't responsible for the 
FMR May fiasco either.

One last thing:  if they truely are serious about doing a story on the
community aspect of raves I can't think of an event where the sense of
community will be much higher.
                                                            
           
I know they will lie to me about their intentions.  I know they may try
and twist my words or any other SFRaver's words around on them.  I can
be extremely cynical about things if I can, and I will be when dealing
with them.  I won't them them walk all over me, sfraves, or the rave
scene in general.

For those of you who are coming down to the Lighthouse rave on Saturday

intersection of those two sets is not null ;^), you may be interested to note
that Little Feat is playing an acoustic show at the Catalyst on the same
night, mere blocks from the Civic & the subsequent rave.  They'll play
from 9:30 pm til midnight, at which point there'll still be 8 solid raving
hours, not including the post-rave beach party.

Subject: The 48 Hour(s) Trip - mutated

34 messages totalling 59k on a single issue in a single day. Not bad,
folks...

On the basis of all this input (including a lengthy telephone discussion
with Brian), as well as a conversation with the producer for the show, one
Kathleen O'Connell (age 32), I think we have reached a decision everyone
can live with:

It looks like *some* part of the 48 Hours crew, perhaps just the producer,
WILL be at Alternity. A camera crew MAY show up for the first hour or so,
but will be not be allowed to tape at random. Anyone who would like to be
interviewed may so volunteer. But the crew will NOT be allowed to roam
around randomly with a camera, and in any case will not be allowed to stick
around for the whole evening.

Of course, it's not ultimately up to me. If anyone strongly objects, we can
ban them entirely, or refuse to cooperate. But I don't think that's such a
great idea. If you want to know why, read on...

Our Illustrious List-Meister rightly claims:

>what got the raves shut down in England was the
>fact that the media hooked into them, that disinformation was spread around,
>and there was basically no one from the rave community who was willing to
>stand up and dispute these rumors.  So the rave community thought they could

>But as others have noticed, we have a _real_ opportunity here.

I was there when it happened. It's true. The main story that was told, in a
nutshell, was "evil drug-pushing rave promoters are destroying the minds of
Britian's teens with the extremely dangerous drugs ecstasy and LSD..." (or
something like that - it's late...).

After reading lots of your excellent postings today, I had the opportunity
to speak once again with Kathleen, the producer for 48 Hours. I started
prodding her to find out exactly what angle she and her crew were trying to
portray. She mentioned mandatory sentencing requirements, the inequity of
busted acid dealers getting nailed for the weight of the paper as well as
the drug itself, and the huge rise in LSD consumption in recent years by
kids aged 12-19.

I shuddered.

She went on to cite statistics from three different sources in support of
her claim.

"OK," I replied. "But do you have the breakdown by actual _age_, or just by
demographic group?"

"Well, I don't have the numbers here in front of me..."

"Hmm. Well, doesn't it seem to make a pretty big difference whether those
numbers are concentrated at 13 or 19? And doesn't the way the data were
collected make a difference too?"

No response. Or at least nothing intelligible or useful. Just evasiveness
and more questions...

I could go on, but I'll spare you. The upshot is that this woman (a) is
pretty clueless (which I figured out Tuesday when I first talked to her),
and (b) has the usual sensationalist mass-media axe to grind.

Having her at Alternity could be a problem, I thought.

Or an opportunity.

Quoth bbehlen:

>The ideal setup is, of course, that we show a 
>positive front much the way KPIX did with Let Freedom Rave.

>One last thing:  if they truely are serious about doing a story on the
>community aspect of raves I can't think of an event where the sense of

So very true.
Let's run with the ball, and do what we can to inject OUR movie (or at
least bits of it) into THEIR movie.

This means we must be careful about what we say, and how we say it. If
you're not confident that you can speak in non-sound-bite material, don't
talk to the crew. Pretend they are not there. They won't tape you without
permission, and you will likely not even notice they are there. Just go
mental. Dance like a flower. Whatever...

But if you can tell a good story, go for it. Talk about the importance of
community in the rave scene. Talk about the synergy between body and
technology that raves make possible. Or talk about the ways psychedelic
experiences have enriched your life (if you want to). Be articulate. Make
yourself understood. Explain that raves are not merely underground drug
parties. Tell 'em about the Bandshell Charity Rave.

YOU be the propagandist!

You get the idea. I'm too tired to say more right now.

	Everything is in motion (which wasn't too hard for us, since the
parts that we worked so hard on at Connection, i.e., security, etc., will
be automagically taken care of by the 1015 Folsom crew).

	As for visuals:

	Andrea Parra will bring a couple small vats of flourescent paint,
a bunch of brushes, and a large white piece of paper, and anyone who so
wishes can come up and create any sort of image upon the paper.  By the
end of the night we will have a very vivid, living mural...

	I will be bringing in my roommate's 486 with a couple of VERY trippy
graphics programs.  The cool thing is they are somewhat interactive, meaning
the user can control very easily the action on the screen.  It just seems
appropriate for our shindig.

	Steve@mtxinu is bringing a simple 8mm film loop he's made.

	Chris Beaumont will be bringing smart drinks for sale, and possibly
the oil and water projection setup.


	Now, for what we need:

	FANS.  I can go rent some big 2 foot fans for $16 each, but if people
could bring some floor fans from home that would be mucho better.  If you can,
please get back to me about it tomorrow before 3pm.  I'll even let it serve
as your admission in. ;)

	I shoulda kept the list from Connection... can anyone spare the effort
to bring a blacklight or two?  They have one or two there, but they may be 
used for the muraling, and another two would be great.  Again, this can serve
as your admission in.

	Water will be provided, so we don't have to worry about bringing Lake
Arrowhead like we did for Connection.


	Cameras _will_ be allowed in from anyone who wants to bring one.  To
ease the confusion, if you know you'll want to bring in a video camera, let
me know before midnight tomorrow night so I can give the security guy a list
of names of who can bring them in.  And if you decide at the last minute, just
ask the doorman to ask someone to get me, and I'll come out and say it's fine.
I just want to put up a cohesive front if the 48 hours people try to sneak
theirs in.

	About 48 hours:  like Jonathan said, we'll let them in, sans camera, 
and we will allow them to ask people if they'd like to be interviewed on camera
outside the club or the next day or something.  There really is no reason to
fear them - I'm going to make an effort to talk with them like I would talk
with anyone else at a rave, and I encourage you to do the same.

	I encourage EVERYONE to bring something with them: a trip toy, cool
necklaces, Cheerios,... you know what I mean.  


	And yes, the cover will only be $5, so there won't be a very big
"guest list" (those on it are those setting up, and the DJ's - I will send
you all mail.)  The first $500 goes to the DJ's, the rest to be split among
the DJ's and whatever costs the painting and oil-and-water projections might
have.

	I am _very_ excited about meeting you all.

So, the die is cast, the decision has been made.  Sounds like a reasonable
solution:  no one appears who doesn't want to.  No random taping, they're
gone by 4am (I'm probably won't be arriving 'til about then -- who wants
to be at the first couple of hours of a rave???)

I'll have to admit that if any group can make an articulate case for the
higher ideals of this movement, it's us (well, you guys anyway).

One things remains puzzling to me:  if Kathleen and crew are as clueless as
they're made out to be, how did they manage to stumble onto the least publicized
and most obscure raves (Equinox and Alternity)?  I'd expect them to have
latched onto Planet Groove or Promised Land or whatever mega-promoted
blockbuster is on offer for tonight.  I guess they deserve credit for
doing their homework...

If you do manage to be interviewed by them, best of luck!  Try and
sneak a mention of the charity rave for me (and Martin and Gavin...)

'til then... some sleep, anyone?

A question:  what makes *anyone* believe that 48 hrs will stick to their
promises about no random taping?  Especially when "cameras are allowed";
the agreement seems meaningless, since 48 hrs are not our friends and we
can't possibly know who is taping for them.

If I have to be on my best behavior, I can do that at home.  Oh well,
I hope there's something good in all this........

I have a friend who may go with me to Alternity (I haven't read all of the SFR
mail to read whether 48 hours will be there or not), but she usually gets some-
what claustrophobic at Raves.  Does anyone know if there is a chillout room or
equivalent at 1015 Folsom?

Anyway, take care and rave on...

Subject: Sound Bites for Alternity

	Potential Ideas/sound bytes for Alternity
	-----------------------------------------
Ok. I've talked to some people in some organizations that I have dealings with
who deal with the media on a regular basis.  They offered the following advice:
Producers want interesting, to the point statements also known as sound bites.
If we give them really interesting, insightful and quality sound bites, they 
will be less tempted to opt for the "junk food".  We must give them an abundance
of good ideas, one liners, and brief explanations.  Don't run on for several
sentences, you will either not make it in or be edited.  Refrain from using
"Um and Uh".  Be ruthless, don't let them put words in your mouth, if they
interpret something thay you said and you didn't say it. Say "NO, that's
not what I ment/said"


Below is my personal list of ideas/sound bytes that I've been playing with.
I DON"T CLAIM ANY OF THIS TO BE TRUE FOR THE SCENE AT LARGE, THIS IS JUST
WHAT I THINK.  PLEASE MAKE YOUR OWN LIST UP.
You don't have to bring this list and read from it or anything like that
but making a list will put certain ideas fresh in your mind and you will know
what points to stress.

Stress that we are dealing with awareness and consciousness. Not drugs.

Sound Byte:"A new form of consciousness"

The Rave scene is about everyone comming together regardless or race,
sexual orientation, or class to participate in a group awareness exercise.

When people dance at a rave, they are experiencing a form of body/mind
integration, sort of like the "peak experience" that some people have when they
ski, run or play other types of sports.
(emphasize physical/mental health and fitness not drug taking, it's hard
to dance for 4 hours straight if your drunk)

Raving is NOT about getting drunk and getting laid,  its about becomming
intune with your global family and becomming aware.

Eventhough some people have spiritual or religious experiences while they
are dancing, there is no "rave religion" (This is indeed debateable
but to middle america, if it ain't jesus, it's devil worship, so be careful)

Very few folks use drugs at raves.  (Say this A LOT!)

Emphasize that we have a life and community outside of raves.

Talk about the benefit rave in the park, the money went to Battered Children's
Shelter, Rain Forest Action Network and ?? (Let's get the names straight!!)

Emphasize that we ALWAYS cleanup behind ourselves when we have a Beach or
outdoor rave. 

Sound Byte: "Leave the place cleaner then we found it."

Raver's exhibit family values, it's out intention to extend the family to be
the whole planet.

A rave is one of the few places that a woman can go alone and dance and not
be pawed or harrassed.

Subject: Re: Sound Bites for Alternity

Also (adding to Geoff's list of sound bites):

Drunk driving/etc is generally not a problem at raves.  Neither is fighting
or sexual abuse.

Alcohol or other drugs are not necessary to have a good time, as there is a 
lot of cathartic energy from the crowd.

Rave crowds tend to be ethnically diverse, with very little or no racial
bigotry or homophobia.

Reporters don't scare us, were not hiding anything, all are welcome, etc.  :)

Subject: Not about 48 hrs

If you want smart drinks and even 500-mg Vitamin C's to remain legal, listen up.

The FDA has proposed to make most nutrional supplments
prescription-only, as noted in the massive post forwarded by Mike the
other day.  One thing we can do to oppose this naked power grab on
behalf of pharmaceutical cors (why do *they* get to call them
"ethical" drugs anyway?) is to call Congress today and Monday.
Amendments by Senators Harkin and Hatch which would require the FDA to
permit more alternative health care and delay the nutritional regs,
respecitvely, are currently under consideration as part of the
conference committee proceedings on the Labor and HHS approprations
bills.  So, call California Rep. Ed Roybal, who is on this committee.
I just called and his (awfully non-committal ) staffer said that thy'd
had 150 calls on the subject today.  Let's keep up the pressure.  
Arguments to consider include civil liberties, AIDS treatments, and 
health cost containment via preventative health.

Call the congressional switchboard at 202-225-3121.

More info on this issue, call Nutritional Health Alliance,
800-226-4642.  They may be just a lobby, but in this instance they are
defending an important right.

btw, is there a way to e-mail Congress.  It would sure be easier.
Over to you, Chris!!

Well, last night I could not go to Alternity because I have to do 2 midterm
papers for a philosophy class which is due Monday that I still have to work
on.  But, I really want to know how everything went.  Everything including
any strangeness or nonstrangeness that occurred with the 48 Hours crew.

A good thing that happened last night was that I was listening to UCSC's
radio station (KZSC 88.1FM) when the DJ announced that the second paid
subscriber to call up the station wins tickets to the Lighthouse rave
tonight in Santa Cruz.  Well, I took off to the phone and actually got the
ticket!!!! Yippee!! My subscription to that station has paid itself off
doubly already besides just by supporting the station. Well, I hope to see
some of you this evening!  Bye! -marlo:)

Subject: Alternity: 4, Not 48, HOURS


 My four hours at ALTERNITY was some of the best I've ever spent at a rave! 


 How many SFRavers decided not to come to ALTERNITY because of "48 Hours"? 
Well, the dreaded media manipulator vultures didn't show up, unless they 
were filming people from a parked van or some other idiotic thing like 
that. Not even the reporter showed herself. The crowd we got was estimated 
at 170 max ; maybe more would have showed up if not for the "48 Hours" scare? 

 The basement of 1015 Folsom is like a minature warehouse, except with a 
low ceiling, a bar, a pool table, and some light effects. We never fully 
employed the club's light effects - so the visuals were provided by two 
SFRavers - Chris Beaumont did neat oil projections, and [ insert name here 
] projected some homemade 8mm tape loops. It would have been an unbearable 
sweatbox, except that lots of folks brought electric fans. Those fans saved 
me from premature exhaustion many times.

[ QUESTION(s): Pool tables at raves, good/bad/who cares? Who should get 
the title of "SFRaves Pool Shark"? :-) ]

 Juice was being sold at the club's bar for $2.00. No smart bar, as Chris 
was worried that the "48 Hours" crew would make an unjust connection 
between illegal head drugs and smart drinks. As for water, I understand 
that the club's bar had H2O for free.

 The DJ's - Scott (?), Jon , and Eric - provided great music . After some 
initial problem with the turntables, the music flowed non-stop until 6AM.
Speaking of Jon ( and Mike and Jeff ), the UVC 12" - "The Trip" -  was
indeed available for sale. I just played my copy - sounds great!

 Were all the people there SFRavers or their guests? Some folks gave me a 
feeling of being neither - patrons of the club who had wandered into our 
gathering by error or curiosity. In any case , the mood was definitely up 
for the majority of the crowd. When not dancing, people could sit at tables
and couches at the periphery of the space, or go upstairs to the empty
part of the club. Given the time, some folks napped. I was dozing 
during the last 20 minutes of ALTERNITY - this one speaker cabinet had
some nice felt covering; it made a firm, albeit noisy, bed.

 We got to meet Cynthia's fiancee, who seems to be in aeronautics, by the 
look of him. Short fellow, nice scarf!

*******************************************************


 It was great to meet all the SFRavers that I know, and some new ones ( I 
was the guy wearing the big checked Goofy shirt ). Later on this morning, I 
bought a nice shirt at the Psychedelic Shop on Market - it's got a yellow 
sun on the front, and a blue moon on the back. I'll be wearing it at the 
Santa Cruz Civic LIGHTHOUSE charity rave tonight - if you see me, say/shout 
hello!

Subject: 4, not 48 hours!


	Yes, the rumors are true - 48 Hours didn't show up (I think they got
our hint).  Which is a good thing, because now we won't be any part of their
story (sorry all you camera hogs :).  I talked to Kathleen, the producer, over
the phone yesterday, and it became painfully clear that she was a Reporter
with a Story to follow, and she was going to find her Story whether it was there
or not.  She came right out and asked me how people could dance all night 
without the use of serious drugs.  I told her, in much more diplomatic terms,
to get a clue. :)

	If they want to come back and do a story on raves, then we'll be right
there.  But this episode is on _LSD_.  When I questioned her bias, she said,
"Well, I'll tell you, we'll be profiling two ravers, one who uses LSD and one
who doesn't.  Fair enough for you?" *sigh*


	As for Alternity - it was a blast!  So cool to meet more people from
the list, so cool to be in a space as creative as that was... the flourescent
mural painting was a smash, the oil/water visuals were cool, and at some points
people put their faces right up against my roommate's computer screen and 
zoned out on the fractals. :)  The music could have been better, but that was
mainly because the left turntable was misaligned and the speakers weren't all
plugged in the way they should have been.  If (when) we hold one there again,
making sure we have a solid sound system will be my first priority.  Kudos
to the DJ's, especially to Eric Lacy, who did a really excellent last set.
(He also fixed the turntables, albeit a few hours late. :).  

	Accounting:  179 people paid the $5:  $895
		minus $500 for the location:  $395
		minus $50 for the oil/water:  $345
		minus $20 for the piants:     $325
		minus $50/per DJ:	      $175

So $175 will go into the fund for Connection II....


	So let's have an impromptu, small vote - Alternity next month?  Same
space? (private response, por favor)  I think if we do it next week we might
want to do a little bit of advertising (flyers with the name & phone #) and
maybe one larger rave DJ, like Jeno if he's free or Tony or someone... any
thoughts?

	I'm going to LIGHTHOUSE tonight (and dreading the thought of the drive)
and to the after-party on Panther Beach (just north of Bonny Doon, actually, 
and they got permits!) in the morning.

 I just came back from LIGHTHOUSE in Santa Cruz - it's going great! I ducked
out at about 4AM, as I was feeling the effects of going to ALTERNITY and 5 
hours of work, with little sleep. So, someone else will have to report on the
rest of Goa Gill's set. I really like Goa's taste in music, although some
of the segues were jarring. Too bad we won't have him here anymore.

 I was really impressed by the mix of the Santa Cruz crowd, and their great
sense of accepting. All different "types" were there - industrial/goth punks,
'hippies', and modern youth, as well as a good representation of older folks.
I think I recognized Paula P. Orridge, and some other folks associated with
Psychic TV. 

 Other people there that I recognized were Brad, William Penna, Marlo, Brian,
and some others. 

--- I'm way too tired to write more - I keep on slipping into dream mode!
If you were there all the way to morning and back, please do a post about
it for us!

Subject: Hey there!

Well, I made it to my first rave, Quest, at the near-fossilized age of
26.  Great fun!  It was even less trendoid-poseur dominated than I
thought, and the occasional "look at me, I'm dancing" Club MTV
wannabes seemed more laughable than anything.  They also tended to
last about 20 minutes while the Bug-Man (my name for the gent in
glowing deelyboppers) and other ravers just kept dancing away.  This
really impressed me.  People weren't discouraged from posing, but it
seemed far more narcisistic in that crowd than it does even in a
normal club setting.  Wonderful.  The absence of alcohol was also
welcome - anyone who seemed to have a beer (and I doubt I saw more
than one) seemed to be drinking it for thirst or flavor rather than
for drunkeness.  

It was just really sweet to be surrounded by hundreds of people of
every shape, size and description not particularly caring to judge
anyone else or fear being judged.  It reminded me of nothing so much
as a good science fiction convention or a Shonen Knife concert - the
sweet goofiness of it was infectious.  

Happily, nothing about it even remotely suggested a "cyberpunk" feel,
whatever that might be.  It was too primitive for that, thank god.  It
was as if Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney had said "Let's have a rave!"
instead of "let's put on a show!".  

It took me a while to get into the swing of things.  For a while, I
was sullen about a personal problem unrelated to the rave, and the
deejays were playing mostly hardcore stuff, but by 2 or 3, with the
aid of some minor chemical alteration and more trancey music, I was
able to appreciate everything much more.  

Favorite images - 

	The "bug man".  Emerging from a foggy haze to see this
character strutting away filled me with joy.

	The dusky woman with a bandana on her head doing a more
sensual version of the herky-jerky rave dance - not narcisistic, but
not devoid of sexuality either.

	The fellow covered in glitter sinuously moving through the
crowd.  

	Various people in dark areas dancing with small flashlights or
cyalume sticks - an obvious trick, but effective.  

	The forty-something couple, in colorful clothes, who seemed no
more out of place than anyone else.	

Yes folks, it really is everything it's cracked up to be.  I suppose
the people selling "official" rave wear was a bit of a potential
bummer, but hey...It really did feel more like what I imagine a
Grateful Dead show is like than a night at a dance club.  

I didn't make a point of identifying myself as an NE-Raver, but for
the record, I was the sort of sullen-looking chap with long hair and
plaid wool jacket who didn't really dance much.  But I had a great
time.  

Ultimately, "Rave" is a good name for it - half the people there
looked like Buddy Holly :-)

Subject: LIGHTHOUSE

Still dopy from no sleep after LIGHTHOUSE.  I FINALLY made it to my
first rave.  I've been putting off driving up to SF for one, but when
I saw the Lighthouse was going to be right in my own downtown, I just
HAD to go.
  I sure wasn't dissapointed.  The whole experience of pounding
music, the light/video show, and the crowd really came together into
what can only be called a transcendent experience.  Really, I wasn't
on ANY drugs.  I am a devoted Deadhead, and the only thing I can
say is that going to a Dead show is like going on a slow
innertube trip down a lazy river.  Rave is like going over Niagra Falls.
Like a Dead show, though, it's one of those things that you just can't
explain to someone who hasn't gone to one - and you don't need to explain
it to anyone who has gone to one.  It's the experience.
   Maybe I'm being melodramatic about it but I don't think so (at
least not too much).  I really felt good about the crowd.  I went alone,
which is sometimes a little lonely, but it also opens me up to
other people.  It was so great to be out there on the floor immersed in
all of it and then make eye contact with someone.  There was this great
connection there.  At other events (like rock shows) people are into
themselves and you can never even make that momentary contact.
   It also looks like it would be a lot of fun to put one of these
events together.  The computer graphics and video was SO great.  I would
love to help put something like that together.  Well, as you can probably
tell, I'll be going to more raves as soon as I can.
   I've heard ravers say "keep it alive" and now I really know what they
mean.  I can sure see how rave could collapse under its own weight.
It seems like it's going to take a lot of work to keep it from 
happening.  
Just a final thought:
I have a friend who was around SF during the late 60s heyday of 
the "San Francisco Sound".  He remembers all of the bands trying
to "keep it alive" back then: the Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin,
and a thousand bands that we've never heard of.  To hear him tell it,
that whole scene would have collapsed under its own weight in
just a couple of years without Bill Graham.  What do you think - 
does rave need to find its Bill Graham to survive the decade?

Hope to see all of you soon!

Subject: 2 upcoming lectures in Santa Cruz


I don't usually post to this list, but I got a flier about 2 upcoming
events and I thought some people might want to know about them.  If
someone else has already posted about these, please forgive the
repetition.

The first is a lecture by Bruce Eisner, author of "Ecstasy: The 
MDMA Story", on Friday October 2, 7:30 p.m., at the Louden Nelson
Center, corner of Center and Laurel Streets, downtown Santa Cruz.
The title of the lecture is "Ten Billion Years of Psychedelics:
Their History and Future".

The second is a short workshop by Peter Stafford, local psychedelics
activist and author of "The Psychedelics Encyclopedia", Saturday
October 3, 10 a.m.-2 p.m, at the Pacific Cultural Center, 1307
Seabright Avenue (corner of Broadway), Santa Cruz.  The title of
the workshop is "Everything You Wanted to Know About Psychedelics . . .
But Were Afraid to Ask".  Pre-registration is advisable; call (408)
427-9455.

For info on either of these events, call (408)427-9455.  These 
events are put on by the Island Group, a local organization
dedicated to exploring the meaning, uses, effects and societal
implications of the use of psychedelics.  They have regular
meetings and also publish a very interesting newsletter.  Their 
phone number is above and their address is 1803 Mission St.,
Suite 175, Santa Cruz, CA  95060.

Subject: Lighthouse...

I thought I'd just have to add my few cents about Lighthouse...
*One of the happiest experiences of my life... (no drugs, honestly)*
I was going with a group of about 10 virgin ravers from UCSC, I've been to
quite a few and with the school year starting and new friends being made,
I was trying to share the joy of the whole experience, but unfortrunately,
When we found the price to be $19 at the door, they all turned on me and
grouply decided that it wouldn't be worth it for something so public as to
have tickets through bass and they left me there.  I wasn't going to spoil
my evening with their ignorance...  I have never raved alone before but I
must say the music, laser, videos and mood was all just so perfect that I
just danced and danced and danced and danced becoming entirely too happy 
for my own good.  I didn't see anyone I knew, I didn't have a Sfraves button
printed out and didn't see any around, but If anyone saw me I was the guy
with the 808 State whistle from last weeks Wish.  All I can say is that it
was pure bliss, until my legs actually gave out from under me around 3:30
because of overexhaustion from some serious hours of racquetball earlier
and so I had to go home and collapse.  I'm still having troubles walking
but I feel just wonderful....
That's all I have to say, thanks for listening...

Subject: SFRaves-planners list now set up


The SFRaves-planners alias has now been set up.  The idea is that those of us
who want to plan SFR events cathe planners list for logistical stuff
like, "who can bring firewood" rather than fill up mailboxes in Iceland with
it. It's certainly not an exclusive list, anyone is welcome to join, but
if everyone decides they want to be on it then a separate alias is
kinda pointless. :)

I will keep the normal disution list appraised at least twice a week about
any discussion that appears on the planners list, so not being on it doesn't
mean you can't come to the parties we'll throw or help out.  (wow, a triple
negative. cool.)

Right now I'm still taking suggestions for a good location for Connection II.

I checked out the Burlingame Drive-In and it didn't appear ideal.  Good points:
it had barbed wire around the perimeter, which would keep people from sneaking
in, and it was really close to the city.  Bad points:  it was REALLY busy on
the Saturday night I checked it out, which means it would probably be expensive,
and it was just so damn BIG.  So if anyone knows of a drive in close to the
city yet in an industrial part and hidden from view of the freeway, and which
is strapped for cash or even closed down, lemme know.  Projections upon a
tattered screen could be quite cool.

Oh yeah, the planners alias is sfraves-planners@soda.berkeley.edu.  If
you want on write to me (bbehlen@soda.berkeley.edu for those of you in
header-stripping-land :) or sfraves-request.

Subject: Alternity


Okay, well, I finally lost my virginity.  Went to Alternity on Friday
night, and had a really good time.  My first rave, I was surprised that
there weren't that many people, yet the advertising I'd read said that it
was a small affair.

Met some guy there, who asked me if I know "The other guy, Johnathon, from
Apple."  Nope.  Johnathan, hey dude -- feel free to call me sometime.

There was some dude there who looked totally stoned, who was selling all
sorts of flashy gizmos.  He claimed to have written WordStar (hell, maybe
he did, but he was saying "Man, gotta find a job..."  Hehe...).  Love
people.

The intensity amazed me.  It was obvious that the focus was more of an
innerly-directed personal thing than I'd thought -- pretty cool. :)

Someone gave me a flier on the pro's of using X. :)

Had fun with the flourescent paint -- came with a female friend, and
dabbled a bit on her... :)  Folks, she was the one who had all the pearls &
was in black & looked quite frightening (but beautiful when not under the
glow of the flourescent lamps!)...


Anyhow, overall, way cool.  I think that I could get used to parties like
this... :)  Didn't see any camera crews, etc., as I'd heard about, but I
had a really good time.

To those I talked to, "Hey!"  You were all very cool people.

To the dude who says he wrote WordStar, though, ... pass the bowl. ;)

This was probably one of the worst excuses for a rave I've ever been to.
A friend of mine from LA was visiting, and he had never been to a San Francisco
rave before, and I told him that Wicked would probably be a lot better than
Promised Land, but he already had had plans to meet someone else at Promised 
Land, and we did want to heard Carlos spin, so we went to Promised Land.

We arrived at 12:30 or so.  Tickets were exorbitantly priced at $25 a piece.
It was set up in a drive-in theater.  They had laser shows on two of the
screens, a video set-up on another screen, Digital Media was doing something
on another screen, etc.  Digital Media tried to get a Nintendo game to
project onto one of the screens, but unfortunately they were unable to get
it to work.  Overall, the video/laser setup was the only aspect of the rave
that I did not consider to be a complete failure.

The drive-in's concession stand building was open, making this the first rave
that I've ever been to where you could buy corn dogs and nachos and play video
games.  (I'm not sure if this was a pro or a con.)

The music was pretty lame.  We missed Carlos, who had finished his set 
before midnight.  The DJ that was on when we arrived was some LA DJ who was 
playing very generic 150 bpm chipmunk hardcore -- boring.  At 2am another 
LA DJ, John Williams, came on.  He was much better than the guy who was on 
before him, but he ain't no Garth or Jeno.

The Shredder sound system, which is supposed to be famous for being incredibly
loud and incredibly clean, was completely unimpressive.  The sound system at
Connection was much better.  I'm guessing that the Shredder never showed up
and that they had to get a sound system at the last minute.

The crowd was pretty lame too.  People didn't seem to be incredibly friendly.
There were at least a few thousand people there, yet I didn't see a single
slither pile (people on ecstasy laying all over each other).  And there was
*very* little energy in the dance area.  This was easily one of the lamest
rave crowds I've ever seen.  I get the feeling that a lot of the people there
had never been to a rave before and thought it was a very large outdoor pickup
bar.

My friend from LA said that the crowd at Promised Land had less attitude than
your typical LA rave crowd and that the music was about the same quality as the
music that you would hear at an LA rave.  If Promised Land -- easily one of
the worst SF raves I've ever been to -- compared favorably to raves in LA, then
I don't think I *ever* want to go raving in LA.

Subject: Psychedelic Lecture!


     Just to clarify the Island Group activities-


     Authors Bruce Eisner and Peter Stafford will speak on the topic,
"Ten Billion Years of Psychedlics:  Their History and Future" at the
Louden Nelson Center in Santa Cruz on Fri. Oct.2 at 7:30 pm.

     Ten billion years being the lifetime of the sun, Peter will begin
the lecture by covering the first 5.7 billion years and Bruce will field
the remaining 4.7 billion years.  On Sat., Oct.3, they will conduct a work-
shop entitled, "Everything You Wanted to Know About Psychedlics But Were
Afraid to Ask" from 10am to 2pm at the Pacific Cultural Center in Santa Cruz.

     Stafford is the author of three books including the Psychedlics 
Encyclopedia  (Ronin Publishing, Berkeley, CA) which has just released the
Third Edition of the book many call the essential reference to the entire 
spectrum of psychedlic compounds.  Eisner, psychedelic journalist, entrepreneur
, and psychological researcher has been nicknamed "Dr. Ecstasy" for his 1989
volume, Ecstasy:  The MDMA Story (Ronin Publishing, Berkeley, CA), the only
book to date to comprehensively describe the history, use and effects of MDMA
(Ecstasy is currently enjoying it's recent Second Edition release!).

     Tickets for the lecture are $6.00 at the door (no advance ticket sales or
reservations for this so get there early to be sure to get a ticket).  Workshop
tickets are $25 and $15 for students with a valid student ID.  Information and
reservations for the workshop can be had by calling (408) 429-1676 or (408)
427-1942.

     If anyone from sfraves wants to attend both of these events and has 
to come from out of town contact me paul@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.us (408) 335-3883

Subject: Alternity and Connection II


I thought Alternity was great, but I had one problem with
it.  The British dude at the door was unusually polite for a
goon, but he was giving some of my friends problems because
they were under 21.  I talked to Brian, he found Eric (?)
the owner, and they all talked it over, and the doorman
volunteered to "use his discretion", and he let us all in.
I was happy, my friends were happy (they seemed very
impressed by my "connections"), so I thought it was all
okay...

But I talked to someone else later (winston?) who told me
that some of his younger friends hadn't made it in.  So the
doorman was being arbitrary from that point on?  Had he made
an exception just for us? 

So that's my only problem with the place.  To have even a
fuzzy under 21 cut-off on an event without alchohol seems
really dumb.  

(It also seems to me that doing it monthly may be a bit too
frequent.  Maybe bi-monthly?  I'm not sure about this one
way or the other.)

Club Security practically defines the word "arbitrary."  I was
standing around outside one particular event watching the guy let
people in (despite the "no ins and outs" rule) based on nothing more
than his personal whim.  Cute girls seemed to have it easiest.

>So that's my only problem with the place.  To have even a fuzzy under

was the bar open at all when alternity was admitting?  i can
understand the club owner point of view - one single drink sold to an
underage person can cause them to lose their liquor license, and if
they're not carding at the bar, then you can expect massive paranoia.
no liquor license means no club, basically.

Yeah, it would be nice if we could do something really clear cut about
this, but when I talked to Brian I got the impression it may not be possible.

Hello SFRs,

A big thank you to all attended Alternity this past Friday. I had a really
good time. I can't beleive that the reality came for a simple idea and post.
I met some of you, I hope to meet more of you at the next Alternity
The owner of 1015 (IRA) really like us and wishes to have us back. I'm working
with Brain to solidify a date which may be the 23rd of October.
(By the way Wicked is on the 16th at 1015 so mark your calendars.) Next time
I'll make sure the sound will be better. Ira is planning on beefing up the
system in the basement at 1015.

As for Sacto... if any of you SFRs are going to be in the Sacramento area on
Thursay or wish to drive up, I'm DJing at a club called RAGE (directions to 
follow). According to promoters it's supposed to be really good. I'll at least
try to make it fun. Anyway, your support would be grateful.

Directions:

>From SF go 80E towards RENO
80E will turn into the 80 Business loop
take the CAL-EXPO exit
2nd light make a left onto Challenge
its on the right near a Circut City
the adresss is 1890 Arden Way (916.929.3720) <-- if you get lost


Hope to see some of ya there.

Subject: My weekend: Alternity // Home made techno/rave musiq


Alternity was great -- the kind of rave I like. As I alluded to before, I
think I'll be avoiding the big mega-raves in the future and keep on
sticking with these little roving underground jobbies. Kudos to Eric Lacy
and Jon Drukman for killer over-the-top DJing (got there too late to hear
the first DJ).

So we're gonna have Alternity every friday? Please?

I spent the rest of the weekend in my flat looping samples offa my old funk
CD/LPs on this amazingly cool sampler that just got released -- Emu
Emulator IIIxp with a beautiful front-end provided by a studio-quality
Apogee analog to digital converter. High-fi heaven, as one might
hope/expect for over $6000.00 worth of electronics.... Too bad it was all
on loan to me for 4our days and I had to return it today (waaaah)...

Came up w/ some interesting little techno-funk acid-{sp,j}azz tracks mixing
together loops of sped-up Kool und Das Gang's "NT" with that telltale horn
flourish from the Sugar Hill Gang's "8th Wonder" and midi sync'd resonant
filter sweeps of some techno synth goobers lifted from Fierce Ruling Diva's
"Rubb It In"...

Another loop mixed loops from The O'Jays "For the Love of Money" (sped up
to approx 130 bpm) with aforementioned telltale Sugar Hill horn flourishes,
a bass and grunts from Isley Brother's "Fight the Power" and Fierce Ruling
Diva "Whipped Cream" ...

Doing this shit (looping, syncing multiple loops so they beat-match and
don't clash key-wise) takes a *LOOONG* time (and I thought writing software
took a lot of patience) -- how much time (on average) do you techno-makers
out there spend on a track?

Copyrights? Copyrights... I don need no steenkin' copyrights ...

And then I listened to my recently purchased The Ultraviolet Catastrophe
"trip harder" LP and realized how far I still need to go...

Subject: Lighthouse


I got to Lighthouse in Santa Cruz a bit after midnight.  The price at the door
was $19.  I hear that it is really expensive to rent the Civic Center for a
night.  Regardless, I walked in and saw booths set up that were from locally
owned shops (Anubis Warpis, Free Exchange) instead of the usual Ameba and DNE
tables. It was strange to think of a rave at the Santa Cruz Civic.  When I
walked in the main auditorium there were people everywhere dancing.  I was
really glad to see that this was not going to be a standaroundandlookatpeople
rave.  I circled the entire floor to zero in on any people I knew.  Results:
zilch.  After dancing for awhile I saw one other UCSC geekraver besides the one
I came with and then Larry Ching and Brian B spotted me later.  I saw William
Penna and later on found Paul@cruzio.  I recognized Whit from Connection and 
saw a few people I knew from school who love to rave.  The music DJ'd by Brad
was wonderful.  It was really nice hard techno with really tweaked and twisted
noise (my favorite).  After him was Goa Gil.  I really liked his musical 
selection as well.  It seemed a bit less harder techno but was really groovable.
I talked to Craig also and he said that the decrease in sound level around 3Am
was because there was a noise complaint.  I also heard today from a friend that
the noise complaint was from the firemen at the station just next door who were
unable to sleep.  The visuals were amazing.  I was really happy to see the 
psychic cross in so much of the projections.  I also thought that the crowd
mix was wonderful.  There were a lot of people there I think may have either
been incoming freshmen to UCSC or high school students that looked like they
were having a blast dancing for hours.  In general the Santa Cruz raves have
seemed to attract a really diverse crowd which I think is WONDERFUL.  I had a
great time, but had to leave at 4AM because I had to rest up to get energy to
type out my papers the next day.  A rave lasting until the next day within
walking distance from where I'm staying and I have to leave early.......

  What you never want to do, is go to a *BIG* rave in LA.  Just like
you would never want to go to a big one in SF.  The smaller LA raves

Subject: LIGHTHOUSE was cool


     Well I think the LIGHTHOUSE was pretty cool myself even if I was
involved with it.  There were some obvious shortcommings like small crowd
and after BASS was through it became kind of pricey.  But the people who
did come were mostly very nice people to party with.  The artists who worked
the video and lighting and sound/music succeeded at their attempt to work in
conjunction with each other in order to create an environment conducive to a
trippy evening with or without enhancers.

     Thank you very much to the SFravers that came all the way down here.  Brian,
 I hope I didn't appear ingracious when you arrived.  I was taking care of a
chore and was unable to find you later on.

     The beach started late because the sound system that was supposed to be
brought down by Mr. Floppy   to the beach never arrived so the one at the Civic had           
to be taken out there.  That system was set up late waiting for the fog to clear              
a bit out of fear of the speaker cones absorbing moisture and getting damaged.   
Eventually we got enough cabinets out so that it sounded good anywhere you
went.  People danced in the surf, on the rocks, while they walked around, or
just relaxed and enjoyed the afternoon.  Also a small crowd, 40-50 at the
peak.

     I'm sure glad Alternity resolved itself for everybody.  See you all next
time!

Yes, there were some problems with the sound.  I found that there

speakers.  I tried to stay away from the bad sound and just listen
to the good speakers.  The sound was great from a lot of the dance

Ya, they were just aquaintences that I ran into so it wasn`t as
bad as if they were friends that I brought to get in with me but
we should see if we can take care of this for all under-age ravers.

This is not strictly related to rave, but, you know,
humankind does not live by techno alone...

I'm listening to the new Muslimgauze CD, titled "Zul'm".
Imagine ambient techno, with tribal elements thrown in
(i.e. substitute Middle-Eastern percussion for drum
machines)  -- this would sound ideal in a chill space!
Enough electronic processing to put it in a class apart
from most of what is called "world music".

In fact, one track, titled "Indian Summer of Benazir
Bhutto" does have a house-ish feel to it.

Highly recommended.

Some clubs, 1015 Folsom included, are 21+ at all times, just because it is
too expensive for them to get the permits (is it even possible?  Not sure)
to be 18+ after 2.

>I was even at one rave where they kicked out everyone who was under 21

This is because the police have found a new weapon - a law dating back to
many years ago which established a curfew of 2:30 in the city for minors.
They've decided to start enforcing it selectively... it's been on the books,
but never used until recently.

Hmm... time for some rave political action?

i love muslimgauze.  there's a loop from a muslimgauze track on the
ultraviolet catastrophe single in fact.  don't tell anybody.

understandable - it samples the drum track from psychotropic's big hit
"hypnosis."

>Highly recommended.

seconded.  "zul'm" is great, as is "united states of islam."  the
latter is more drum-oriented; it has almost nothing in the way of
melody.

the only caveat i would add is that muslimgauze is pro-palestinian and
there is some pro-palestinian propaganda on their disc's artwork (not
in the music tho).  if this makes you uneasy, you might wish to
consider whether you can live with yourself if you buy one of his
discs.

The music recommendations, techno or not, have been some of the most
useful posts on this alias. Please keep them coming.

My non-techno contribution is 'Spiritualized' (group and title). These
guys used to be Spacemen 3. The sound is incredibly mellow. Slower than
any Velvet Underground / Nico 'come down from your bad trip' tune, and
twice as effective! It's particualarly good for waking up at 2PM on a
given post-rave day while you stub your toes into the reality of the
harsh world.

Also, for rap listeners, 'Poor Righteous Teachers' is hot. Great
percussion, doesn't sound sequenced, mostly 4/4 quarter note rhythms
with sixteen-note rap. Great 'feel' to the music.

and before "usi" was the disc "iran" which is more tribal with revolutionary chants sampled from the many demonstrations in Iran since the revolution. I also have four of their earlier records buried deep in my crates somewhere. I think you make a good point that the music lets you interpert the politics rather that any overt fist waving. and one
should stick to books for reading rather than record sleeves.

If you like these guys or any other of the political rythmic-industrial-minimalist bands, check their common godfather: 23 Skidoo. some of best bass heavy music you can find and back in early 80s they were on fire. I find 23 skidoo to be the  the common reference point for bands such as Renegade Sound Wave, Fini Tribe and Meat Beat Manifesto.

while on this music thread, i got a copy of the new depth charge single called "Nectar". first single in almost 2 1/2 years. their first three singles were all gems of creativity, each time pushing the envelope a bit further with wild samples, lazy drum loops. however, time is much more cruel to artists in the fastpaced world of dance music.
a very solid tune with a bass line so think it should distort most speakers but nothing that stands up in the face of all the other releases and boast, top that.

another pleasant surprise is the new happy mondays. stinkin thinkin is Narc Annyms term for the urge. despite what i think of the mondays as people, this songs is bleak and strangely beautiful. it is remixed by pete heller and terry farley of primal scream and st etinne fame. all of mr. ryder trials and tribulations over that last year and their chaotic recording session with tom tom club has led to this ... and there is that curious line "the living dead don't get a holiday"

last but in no way least, the most original and eclectic house thingy i have bought all year is the double record by ultramarine. it is called "every man and woman is a star" this duo used to lurk on the hopelessly ecelectic belgian label le disc du crepescule until this british release. the songs here bring a tasteful modern feel to flamenco, free form jazz and host of latin styles. it is a record that always puts me and my "circulo du amigos" in a good mood. you may think of them as a more acoustic version of yello.

feed them soulbuds, they can never become full

i have EMAWIAS on the brainiak release (distributed by les disques du
crepuscule) and i think it's pretty good.  reminds me of a more
acoustic hippy version of The Orb.  drum machines and 303 basslines
with acoustic guitars and flutes.  i wouldn't compare them to yello at
all!  yello is all about bright flashy mini-dramas, whereas
ultramarine is relaxed and mellow spacy grooves.  incidentally, if you
like yello, check out "baby" which never got a US release but contains
some of their best work in years.

Here's a message on the 18+ situation I accidentally sent to
doom@leland.stanford.edu instead of the sfraves-planners list:

Here's the scoop on that:

When I was at Wicked on Saturday, I asked the promoter if he knew whether
it was possible to have an 18+ event there (this is the backroom of
Townsend, a.k.a. King St. garage).  My logic was: the bar is not a
permanent fixture in that facility, I'd been to an event there a few
months ago that didn't have alcohol, so with no alcohol, why not 18+?

The answer was somewhat disturbing.  Until a month or so ago, this would
have worked.  Recently, however, the city in its infinite wisdom and
concern for the well-being of our younger citizens (NOT!) discovered an
obscure ordinance on the books which states that, under the terms of
the cabaret license which all SF clubs must possess, all persons under
the age of 21 must leave by 2:30am.  Therefore even an event with no
alcohol is off-limits to the 18-21 crowd unless it ends before 2:30.

So it sounds like the doorman at Alternity knew what he was doing, but
decided to look the other way at his "discretion".

It's nice to know that an 18 year old can be drafted to go die in the
halfway around the world, but can't dance after 2:30 in San Francisco.

How many people at Alternity had someone (who you don't know) ask for drugs?
I had two people who didnt't seem to be sfr people (because they were asking
for drugs).  They tried to persist with "This is my first rave" and "me and
my girlfriend just want to split a little X" and "what about acid?" types of
lines.  I got weird vibes from them but maybe they were just ignorant.

     Is the recent thread concerning "Muslimgauze", and related bands about 
that Moroccan/Indian style of really fast music...  I can't verbalize it, but
I went to this Moraccan resteraunt about 3 years ago, and it was then I realized
that this indian style of music was the ORIGINAL ACID!  If anyone knows what
in the hell I'm trying to say, please inform me of things available on CD that
would have this style of music...  

Thanks

	I think you're refering to rai music, a form of pop music extremely
popular in Northern Africa, much of it originating from the Algerian city of
Oran.  As for performers, I can only name two off the top of my head:  Chaba
Zahouania and Cheb Hamid.  Zahouania's album is entitled "Nights Without
Sleeping" and is published on Mango Records (div. Island Records).  Hamid's got
an album called "King of Rai", but I couldn't tell you what label it's on. 
Both albums are a few years old.  Try asking at a record store that specializes
in world music.  I agree that the rai sound is infectious.  Yum!

Some guy in a black tee shirt, white pants w/an Aussie accent asked me
twice if I had any drugs, and wouldn't take no for an answer.  I noticed him
hanging around for several hours, but I NEVER saw him dance or mix it up
with anyone.  Hmmmmm.  Anyway, thanx to the discussion here in the past, I
gave him my new stock answer to strangers who ask for drugs..."Naw, man,
that stuff is BAD for you!!".

Fellow SF_Ravers


I was very pleased to have met some of the folks on the list last week at alternity. I would like to invite all of you to come to a block party on Hayes Street this Friday from 7 to 11. These block parties consist of co-ordinated art openings, sidewalk plays and comedy routines. Hayes Valley ( Hayes Street between Franklin and Laguna) is a nest full of many little furniture design shops, alternative art/media galleries, clothing and eats. There will be about 45 store open serving food, frolic and fun. 

I will be spinning in my store Nomads(556 Hayes) during the party. I usually play a grab bag of fringe house with a slow beat and some old/new acid jazz instrumentals. I would think that this might be a good launching pad for the night voyage.

hope to see you there. if you need better directions just email me.

I won't get on a long winded....  Anyway, I agree.  I think acid was
inspired to some degree with Indian music.  The Beatles music certainly
was from the time when they worked, lived and prayed with Ravi Shankar.
And btw, acid was the drug of the day....

Also, musically there are some similarities....  The continuousness of the
tablas (sp?) equate to the repetitiveness of the beat; the harmonium provides
that "sheet" (as I call it) of sound that pervades the background much like
the rhythym line that is usually layered on top of the basic beat; etc.

I find both hypnotic to some extent:  only one makes me dance and the other
makes me meditate....

  The two most popular Pop-Rai artists that I know of are Chaba Fadela
(the Queen of Rai it seems) and Cheb Mami.  Cheb Mami has a really
popular song called "Rah Eddani" (quite an infectious song) and Chaba
Fadela had a hit with the song "Do the Rai."  There are also a few
Pop-Rai compilations out.  I can't remember any of the labels for
these albums off hand but I can provide it on request.
  There is also a *lot* of this Popular techno middle eastern music
coming out of Egypt, Israel, Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Ofra Haza is probably the most known but there are comps of other
artists avaliable.
  The popular music of India is basically 'Filmi', or music from
films.  It's neat stuff but more "cheezy 70s meets techno" than the
Pop from North Africa and the Middle East.

  BTW, what label is Muslimgauze on?

A good place to start exploring Rai is the two volume compilation
on Earthworks "Rai Rebels".  It features tracks by Chaba Fadela,
Ched Sahraoui, Ched Hamid, Cheba Zahouania, and the ever-popular
Cheb Khaled.

Muslimgauze is on Extreme, out of Australia.

It's been a long time since I've started a thread this long  ;^)

Re: Brian's comment about political action

I'm volunteering for Terry Hallinan's election campaign and I
do mean to use my insider status to lobby him on various SFPD
enforcement issues (especially the fact that cops are hassling
me on the street just for campaigning for him).  FYI, Hallinan
is the most liberal SF supervisor and he's torn into SFPD many
times in his first term.  Unfortunately, his power to effect
reforms is pretty minimal.  But if anyone is going to listen
about police abuses in the SF rave scene, he's the one.  I'd
like to hear about the most egregious cases of crackdown and
what their tactics are for leaning on raves; strict
enforcement of permits is the most obvious, but what else are
they doing?  Don't bother to bitch about drug busts.  There's
just no way to stop SFPD, DEA, FBI, etc. from going undercover
at raves and trolling for dealers.

I'll sum it up and pass it on to Terry.  BTW, if you see a big
guy with a ponytail working a Hallinan table in the Haight,
that's me.
