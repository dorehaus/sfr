If I am not confusing two things, try Sonic Solutions in San Francisco.

Even if I am confusing two things :-)  , they probably know where to send
you.

But I seem to remember that they digitally cleaned up the famous Grateful
Dead album
"Live/Dead" for transfer to CD when the master tape had deteriorated...

I'll check out my CD liner notes later today.  If I have the company name
wrong, look for
a second message in the same batch of mail.

ps it might be more $$ than you have -- although maybe they have a budget
process.

Using your logic, all 7000 USENET newsgroups should be abolished and
replaced just with one "alt.save-the-planet".

>Free your mind and your planet might follow.

You say this, but you don't understand the implications, which is that we
need to discuss "mind-freeing" techniques, not the details of problems.

Since rave is a "mind-freeing" technique, discussing the next FMR is
MORE important for saving the planet than the endless details of all the 
problems of the planet.   (Which Fraser himself has agreed with.)

Hello all you beautiful sfravers,

	This is Greg from Harmony. I would like to first thank everybody 
who helped make last night a dream come true!!!!!! Mostly everything 
worked out great, (one problem with one of the locals.) I really send my 
extra special thanks to all of you who showed up, and brought love to 
the party!!! You guys/girls were amazing!!! I had a beautiful time, 
(after dealing with the stress!) I didn't get to make it to the after 
party, so would someone please write to me and tell me how it was? Also 
I want to say thank you very much for respecting our location the way 
you did!!!! There was not one tag anywhere!!! That is soooooooo cool!!!! 
I didn't really want to spend the day painting the walls. They (owner, 
manager) were very pleased with the way it turned out!!!! So are we!!! 
We did loose a good bit of money, but that's what makes it fun!!! We 
will be back in the very near future!!! If you haven't been put on the 
mailing list yet, please send me the ness. info! (If you want to be on 
our list!) Keep your ears open for a free party from our direction, 
sometime soon!!! Once again thank you, we hope all of you who went had a 
spectacular time!!!!!! I know I did!!!

Peace love and harmony to all,

Shroomy

ps. How did you like the river of life?!!

I guess where I was heading with this thread was a point about Raving with
Intention. So conclusions reached on the dancefloor and inspirations
grasped in the ambient room translate into activity outside the rave. So if
we end up raving to save the planet, we can at least do some practical
stuff too instead of forgetting what we did during the night dreamtime
visionquest.

This is regarding the bad old albums.

You can purchase a peice of equipment from a company called BBE Sound.
The model 462 is really good for bad albums. It helps keep the bass
without distorting the mids(very important for records.

It costs around 400 or less and you get them at K&K music in the city.
E-mail me direct and I'll get you a discount.

Hello everyone,

	This is Greg from Harmony. At Friday night's Harmony party 
someone intentionally/unintentionally made off with one of our most 
meaningful, important props! At the party we had a stuffed animal room, 
where you were free to keep whichever animal you wanted as a companion 
for the night and the rest of your life. However, there were two stuffed 
animals that were not part of this adoption policy. If you noticed on 
the stage above the dj table, there were two Sesame Street charactors. 
Elmo was one and Ernie was the other. At the end of the party while I 
was spinning, I guess some people found their way up to the stage and 
adopted Ernie. Ernie and Elmo were not up for adoption that night, 
infact we tied them to the stage so they would get to cought up in the 
party and disappear!
	The owner of Ernie is very upset that someone has adopted her 
Ernie without her permision. Ernie was a birthday present given to her 
from her fiance. This gift meant a lot to her and him! Ernie was and 
still is a tremendous influence on both their lives! Ernie means a lot 
to these people, please help find him!!! If you know anyone who was at 
Harmony who might know where Ernie is please write back or call the 
Harmony voicemail @ (408)486.9591
	Ernie is about two and a half feet tall, he has orange 
complection, black hair, big eyes, blue sneakers, a stripped shirt, and 
a big smile!!!!! Last reported sight of Ernie was on the stage at 
Harmony, kicking back with his good buddy Elmo. 
	Please, if you have any info. on this incident respond 
immediatly!!!!!! We need all the help we can get in finding little 
Ernie. 

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Shroomy

Well, aren't there political parties in the UK ?

You've never heard of political parties lying and creating propaganda?

Maybe not, since you describe that post as "info".

Well, here is some info:

- There are NO cuts in the school lunch program, despite endless Democrat
propaganda.  The Republicans are proposing a 4.5% increase in the school
lunch program, Clinton's budget proposed a 3.1% increase...

- A majority of "poor" people - using the government's definition - own a TV
and a microwave oven.  A sizeable plurality own cars as well.

- I've seen truly poor people in India - hardly anyone here is that poor.

Obviously, this should be in alt.politics NOT on sfraves...

respect to all,

Saving the planet is a positive activity, BUT
saying that there is very little hope for the planet shows little faith in
Goddess.
Remember - matter is a subset of mind, not the other way around.

Dear Sfravers;

		OH naughty Wicked
		OH wicked Wicked
		Oh Wicked, why are you so bloody fuckin wicked?

	Well folks besides being in a venue to smal, waiting in an 1.5
hour line to get in, DV8 control people shining flashlights in my eyes,
and due to the line having to stand outside while peaking on $80(4X$20)
wEnk wEnk, if you get my drift, it was a great party. The 1.5 hour wait I
mentioned above was kinda an understatement due to the fact that I jumped
a head in the line twice. 

	The basement of DV8 is one of the 1st places I went to when I
arrived on the SF scene, so it was kinda nice going back there, less the
stuff mentioned above. The music was great, the highlite for me was the
music/video show, I'm not sure but in what I guess was da chill room they
had a group of TVs, wrapped in mesh(nice effect), with everything from old
B&W outter space B movies to computer graphics, and with some euro TV in 
there to.

	The vibe of da people seemed really positive & energetic, in fact 
I sure da one room is still opened and quite filled, it was a good one 
despite the obiviou mistakes.

	Well anyway see ya's at Sunset, gonna try and get some sleeo in 
between know and then, and don't forget to set your clocks a head an hour.

Peace & Love
Brian Darkness

 Well ,you're welcome! I brought my wife Mary ( we were the older couple -
asain male in big sun/moon tshirt and large white gal with the tshirt with 
the black celtic design on it ). We both had a good time , for the short time
we were there. ( I had to work on Saturday , so we left during Ethan's set ).
My wife usually doesn't get out to dance as much as I do , so it was great
to have her with me! We were the folks who brought the bananas , the chocolate,
and the date bits. Did they get eaten?

> You guys/girls were amazing!!! I had a beautiful time,

 I felt a little bit guilty about not telling your parking lot guides
about the complaint I had received from onee of the apartment tenants
earlier. She asked me to move my truck out of the tenants' parking,
which was the very area your parking lot guides were telling people to
park!

 Just don't get into the habit of such economics for future events!

Hello everyone:

We at Orbitrecords have some extra inventory on our first single, so if
you haven't heard it yet, here's your chance.  The record is the first
Induction 12", featuring the songs "Attempt" and "Electrostatic". 
Though they're hard to classify, both songs can be considered melodic
acid breakbeat.

Also still available from us is Induction's GONE album, on cassette
only.  This album was recorded about a year ago, and though we initially
decided to stop producing the tape, requests for more of them have
prompted us to produce more.

I know people on the list have both of these things, so if you like what
you heard, let us know!

Also, if you have a WWW browser, you can listen to the tracks before
deciding whether or not to purchase.  Here's the URL:

    http://hyperreal.com/music/label/orbitrecords

Here's how to get the stuff:

    o The OR001 12" is $4 plus $2.50 shipping
    o The Gone cassette is $5 plus $2.00 shipping.

    o make checks payable to Sami Khoury

    o send to:

        Orbitrecords
        1600 Walnut Street, Apt B
	Berkeley, CA 94709

If you have any questions, please feel free to call us at our voicemail
box: 412.392.1505

Thanks for all the support so far, and look for our new record in the
month of May.

	Sami

sunset, actually.  Got shut down while the sun still had a good 2.5
hours before hitting the sea.  The space was pretty amazing--a random
park in Richmond, a big bay-level open space of thick soft thistles
and grass.  MANY people there by the time the police showed, which
was a good six hours after things began.  It couldn't have been a more
beautiful day, no way, not possible, and the many smiling moving 
ravers were digging it completely... the beats generated some great
surrounding energy fields that some of us noticed while feeling the
rhythm flow through.

Now it's getting towards dusk and I'm back home, and wanted to share
some of this springtime vibe with you all while it's still fresh. We
will keep it going, no matter what, and have the time of our lives
doing it.

I didn't say at all that there's very little hope for the planet;  indeed
if I'm accused of anything in the Uk and here it's that I'm far too
*positive* about it.  realistically I'd say we have a 50/50 chance at tbis
point, perhaps a little better. 

what I also say, however, is that we can't rely on truisms like "Truth 
must ultimately prevail".  How does lee or anyone know that?  it hasn't 
happened up till now, so why assume it will happen?  it *can* happen if 
wisdom prevails in time.  I actually believe that we, WoMankind, has 
been on the wrong competitive track for a very long time and we ar now 
running out of time and space, and that's why there is a hope, for the 
first time in history and the last time, that we can raise our voices and 
our banners and actually *change* the system. in our lifetimes, even mine.

what lee says about RC is almost the same as I'm saying - only I'm giving
it all a much shorter time context because that's what I see and believe. 
hence all the news about system collapse that zippies seem to revel in
sometimes.  for the system to be actually changed an increasing number of
people have to see clearly that it is not working, is collapsing (whatever
our opinion about that may be) and that there's actually HERE AND NOW and
worldwide a new culture, RC, which is already spreading at warp speed that
is largely and fundamentalyy about another wqay of living and relating.
and can help to establish the positive cooperative fun-loving
compassionate cultural attitude that needs to become :fashionable" for the
main cultural establishment behind the system to bring about or at least 
accept the necessary change. 

in other words the culture that we need to change the old system is around 
us.  in the Uk it's a national affair and virtually the dominant social 
meme among a new generation.  australia too, as captain crunch has been 
telling us.  etc.  and it's going national here too - and, I repeat, 
america is both the greatest threat to and the best hope for ... the planet.

what happens with RC here is crucial in the world picture. also because 
from here the new meme gets broadcast around the planet.  do we really 
want america to spead a culture of beavis and meathead?  does that please 
and reassure the goddess that all is well?

see you on evolution's barricades. (actually everyone on sfraaes is 
already there - not all realise it fully yet is all.)

fraser.

um actually Sunset never got shut down.  the cops did come but 
only to tell people to move there cars from spaces that were
marked "No Parking"  and then they left.
  what can you say about the vibe?  very very nice.  I just spent
a lot of time smiling and dancing and taking some pictures also :)
i was upset about that cause i dont think i was able to get the 
emotion of the party on the film but for a first try at it not that
bad.
  but phunky vibes, good toonz, beautiful sight.  It was all good.
peace and cee ya around

jumping ahead in the line, is that really something to be gloating

Hello,

The further away you get from a major metropolitan area, the less "rave" and
more "party" you get.

I went to an odd little house party last night out here in the boondocks.

Seems that someone who's parents were away knew the local promoter, and a
party was created by simply getting a few DJs and posting the info on the
hotline.

This house was like one in Pacific Heights (except that out here, what would
be $3 million in S.F. is probably ~$600,00), ie 3 stories on a hill with a
room on the bottom floor half built into the hillside and half facing out
over the pool.  The result being that, when the door to the patio was shut,
you could barely hear the sound system (full volume) outside.  Ideal.

Also ideal were clean restrooms and free water (in fact some people helped
themselves to the refrigerator contents :-(  ) and  ( the Captn would like
this) clear air - everyone took their smoking outside.

And the party was free - in honor of someone's birthday who hardly anyone
knew. :-)

Everyone was very friendly (no one was treated as a stranger), but not much
ravey hugging and "significant eye contact" (actually too dark for that -
usually not much in the way of dance lighting out here).  Plenty of beer and
patio conversations...

Over the past year, the house music around here has gotten significantly
better/ more advanced.  It used to be strictly happy house discoey divas,
lots of vocals.  Last night had few vocals, lots of aceeed and tribal
rhythms.  Still mostly 120-125 bpm.
The best DJ was Paul J.  Unfortunately most of the best stuff had very
cryptic labels (I'm dreaming of a "scratchable" CD turntable with an LCD
screen with artist and track names), but a few tracks that I did notice were:

The Love Tribe - Together   (this did have some vocals)
Marco Polo - A Prayer to the Music  ( I like that name )
Speedy J - [label said "7" but that might be the label name - anyone know?]

Anyone familiar with any of the above?   Are these ancient history in S.F.? 
Cheese Wiz? :-)

	Hey all, as usual I apologize to those of you who see this
message more than once.
	I'm helping put together a party (well, many parties -- check
out http://www.mbc.umt.edu/~ogd/aaxz/raves/ for more information)
coming up in May. We _were_ going to have Derrick Carter come and
spin, but he just called us up to cancel his date. He says he wants to
go party in England for a while.
	I'm bummed, but I'm not down. I was wondering if you kind
souls could link me up with any way to get ahold of the following
people (for booking):

 o Richie Hawtin (yes, I know he's booked until the end of time, but
   I'd like to check and see if he's got an empty hole on May 6th)
 o Jeff Mills
 o Doc Martin
 o Robert Leiner (oh, it is to dream!)

	I'd be most appreciative for any information, and if there's
any interest, I'll post a summary of the information to whichever
lists want it.

thanks in advance,
ozymandias

WOW, what a beautiful first sunset party.  Couldn't ask for better 
wheather, the vibe was great.  Friendly smiles everywhere and a nice new 
spot.
The high lights of the party was the spontaneous cheering and shouting 
when the sun set, increasing everyone's energy causing people to jump up 
and down in rythmic joy.  Another beautiful high light was the forming of a 
big circle as people first joined hands, then danced in the circle.  As 
the energy of all the togetherness and sharing mounted, everyone rushed 
to the center jumping and hooting with extatic pleasure. 
Another great thing I like about the sunset parties is that people also 
get to know one another a little more intimately.  Very nice atmosphere 
for friendly conversation, which I find very difficult in clubs where 
there isn't any quiet spots and you have to shout in someones ear to be 
heard.
Springtime is definitely here, there's that special feeling in the air.

Yeah, yeah yeah. Sunset is Baaaaack!!!  So am I.  I hadn't been out in
months, with the exception of my trip to Frankfurt a month ago which left me
with a near-pneumonia case of bronchitis which means no party, definately no
smoke, just rest -- very boring, but  I can go to....Sunset was beautiful in
every way (though I wished the sound system was facing the other way and
further out in the park so that everyone was facing the sunset.)  Those big,
happy cheering moments sent chills up my spine and over the top of my head
and up -- told ya I hadven't been out in a while :-)  I'll write something up
on my Frankfurt experience one of these days too.
C-ya next sunday!

Recent dicussions about Rave Culture's (RC)* role in improving the global 
situation have inspired us to form an organization whose purpose will be to 
propose specific RC-based solutions to the many problems that now plague us.
Seeing how little time there is to affect change and save this planet, we 
feel that it is no longer satisfactory to simply sit back and wait for 
our "meme" to spread or for PLUR to become fashionably mainstream.  This 
memorandum will be the first in a series of concrete proposals that will
force humanity to take better care of itself and its environment. 

Proposal I: Mandatory Bean Bag Laws
-----------------------------------

1.a. Starting in 1997, all new cars will be required to use bean bag chairs 
for all seating.  The added cushioning should help reduce injury in case of 
accident while maintining (if not improvng) comfort to passengers.  This 
measure should also help drive down insurance rates and the resultant 
lighter weighted cars should see a boost in fuel efficiency.

1.b. All airline carriers to be completely retrofitted with bean bag chairs.  
In addition to the increased safety padding, bean bag chairs with Styrofoam 
beans make excellent floatation devices.  As an added benefit, airplanes 
completely laden with bean bag chairs will no longer need seatbelts, 
eliminating wasteful seatbelt instruction time during takeoff.

1.c.0. All schools, stadiums, restaurants and workplaces in earthquake-prone
areas will be required to have all seating converted to bean bag chairs
by the end of 1998.  Our government's ineptitude in making our buildings
quake-proof can no longer be tolerated!

1.c.1.0. Other mass transit seating - as per section 1.c.0

1.d. The government will finance the free replacement of all wheelchairs 
for the handicapped with new, high quality, *wheelbags* (patent pending).

1.e. The resulting demand for bean bag chairs that will result from these
laws will create much economic opportunity.  Economically deprived areas
will be given the exclusive rights to establish bean bag chair manufacturing
plants, creating a multitude of jobs and capital influx for these troubled
neighborhoods.

1.e. Realizing that imposing one style of furniture on an entire population
conflicts with an individual's right to free expression, bean bag chair
manufacturers will be required to offer bean bag chairs in a variety of
colors and patterns, to be voted upon by local community representatives
who will be selected in special bi-yearly elections.  Airlines will be
exempted from this, since bean bag floatation devices will have to be a
bright orange or pink in order to be easily spotted at sea.

Next: Proposal II - Mandatory Hugging Laws.

luv, for a Rave New World.

amused, dog walkers confused, tow truck operators enthused.  Cyril played

A great rave... John Howard was my fave DJ, but maybe that's just
because i was happiest during his set...

Also we got a bunch of it filmed on hi-8 video. One of these daze, i'll
compress it into MPEG and put some snaps of the rave up on the world
wide web. I'll cut out a few interesting stills so that those with
bandwidth-disability (or rather, those specially bandwidthed) will be
able to see some GIFs...

Does anybody think people will be bothered by having random partygoers
at this party "displayed" on the web without their consent? Please
complain now or forever hold your piece.

glad to see you're on the move, lee. but at this rate, bit by bit (which I
thought we'd agreed will never work)we calulate, here at Megatripolis,
that it will be the year 2100 before it has serious effects. maybe there's
a faster way - just a suggestion? 
fraser

PS  a young raver here suggests making our new lifestyle fashionable 
would be a *lot* faster.  I pass it on - what does the commitee think?

I just wanted to thank everyone for an absolutely BEAUTIFUL weekend.  A 
sunny Saturday afternoon with Mother Earth Sound System and a great group 
of friendly smiling people.... A great time at Wicked (although I heard 
horror stories about the length of time some people waited in line...also 
too crowded until late in the night).  A bigger space for an anniversary 
party would have been more appropriate (but I did appreciate them 
kepping it going until about 8:15).  Back home to chill for a few hours 
and off to Sunset.  What a wonderful way to top off an already great 
weekend.  These parties made my summer last year and I'm so glad they 
will be happening again this year.  Summer is here!! 

Keep smilin'
Andrew

oh at last it's back!  i forgot all about how much fun it was to go to the
sunset party on a sunday afternoon and dance for hours.  i would rather do
that than anything else.

let's all make an extra special effort to clean up when it's done, shall we?
i guess i don't really have to say this to you guys, because people on this
list are usually the Responsible Ones.  sorry!

here's a suggestion, though, in case you haven't thought of it already:  lets
bring flashlights to future parties so that it will be easier to find trash
that people have left behind on the grass.  

who were those folks who showed up wearing big masks and were blowing 
a cardboard tube?  they said it was a "didgeridon't."

well, bye.  see you next sunday, i hope.

Hello Beautiful People,

	This is Greg, and no I didn't loose my bag at sunset! But I know 
a good friend of mine who did!!! It was a green back pack with a 
black Nine Inch Nails patch on the back. It had a "Harmony" laminate 
from our Bouldercreek party on one of the zippers, and an "Inneraction" 
laminate on the other zipper. It also had some sort of "Elmo" sticker on 
it somewhere. And inside it had a keropi note book and a blue stuffed 
animal (bird.) Please if you have seen this bag contact me via, 
ascend@netcom.com or (408)486.9591 
	Also if you have any info on the Ernie from Harmony please call 
me at those numbers!

Thanx
Peace, love and harmony to all

Shroomy

Subject: Another Wild Weekend!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I flew in Friday morning from Portland and arrived in so-so weather,
which was kind of disappointing after the nice weather at home all week.
But no matter (and actually the weather was quite nice all weekend!).
Did a little spinning at Ameba in the afternoon, chatted with Markie,
Jeno and Terrence Toy (who is producing a new house release called 
"Everybody Is a Star" featuring an excellent "OOBE Astral" remix by
Ameba's own OOBE/Andrew, I got to give Andrew a pleasant surprise by
playing it as he was walking back in after a break :).  Gavin Hardkiss
came by with copies of *his* new CD which also looks really good.

But the big news at Ameba, I have-ta-tell-ya, is ELECTRO.  Yes friends,
the Electro Revival is now in full swing, dust off those old Herbie
Hancock disks and catch the new ones from artists like the Jedi Knights
and Deluxe.  Allen Ameba says (perhaps only half in jest) that he wants
Ameba to be the West Coast's electro headquarters.  I told him why stop
there?! 

I went down to the lower Haight to help gather materials for the New Moon
party and stopped in briefly at Zebra Records, an interesting shop which
has good hip hop and acid jazz and, over in one of the bins, the *only*
West African 12" singles I've ever seen in the States.  I snagged two
Francos, a Pepe Kalle and a Zaiko Langa Langa, ah soukous!!

Michelle drove Mona and me up to the New Moon location up in the hills
of West Marin, the area of Inverness to be exact, north of Olema which
in turn is north of Bolinas, out on the coast.  The location was a house
at the top of a narrow drive up in secondary growth redwoods, a really
nice area.  Greg and Ann also were there and soon we had boxes of
decorations into the house and began setting up around 11.  

I know there were problems finding the party, but many people did manage.
The only difficulty then was that the sound system was late showing up.
Someone brought in an amp and I started playing tapes from the January
New Moon to fill in, and finally the real system arrived around 2.  I kicked
off with about a two and a half hour set that I thought went over very well.
All over the musical map as usual, a little ambient at the beginning, some
trancey house and housey trance, and a half-hour of dub which went over
amazingly well.  There were two main party rooms with sound from the DJ
setup, so it was kind of a guess as to how things were going in the other
room.  In addition, due to the late start it seemed like the party vibe
had a very hard time getting going.  But no matter . . . anyway, DJ relief
arrived at 5 am and I went outside for some fresh air.

Shortly thereafter we were faced with one of those situations where we have
to stop paying attention to what we are enjoying and instead deal with what
happening in real life.  And what was happening was two different and
particularly difficult to deal with bad acid trips.  It freaked out a lot
of people and put a damper on the vibe, to be sure, but . . .

But what happened was in itself quite amazing.  It took a long time, and
we were clumsy and somewhat uncoordinated in our efforts, but eventually
an amazing gathering of people and energy occurred, with many people
offering help and suggestions in a *positive* fashion, and the crisis
eventually passed with, at least in the case I'm most familiar with, no
bad effects.  I want to offer my sincere and deepest thanks to all who
helped us through this struggle to help our friends.  The situation called
on all of us to push our envelopes of reaching out and caring and working
for a good solution in a situation that was difficult to comprehend and
even frightening at moments.  The sight of two dozen people gathered in
a circle and offering their hands and hearts and voices has to be one of
the most powerful things I've ever experienced.  We need to take care of
each other in many ways, and sometimes in ways that are hard to imagine.
I am so thankful that, regardless of our uncertainty and inefficiency,
the most important thing of all happened, which is that many people 
gathered together and *stuck with it* for as long as it was needed.
And when it was over we went out into a beautiful and sunny if suddenly
windy and chilly morning (the wind having shifted right around sunrise).

I know for myself it's important to learn a bit more about the right way
to deal with the personal emergencies that can happen at our events or
really at any time.  What happened that night was not really anyone's
fault, but it can happen to anyone who alters their consciousness knowingly
or, as in the case with those who are unfortunate enough to have innate
chemical imbalances or other problems (epilepsy, for example), who are
simply subject to the changes that their bodies go through regardless.
We all have our physical and mental frailties and incompleteness to deal
with, and it is so important to remember that we all need help with those
sooner or later.  So, as the I Ching so often instructs, No Blame, and
move on to those actions which the Superior Person should follow to move
forward . . .

The remainder of the party was actually very enjoyable, I especially enjoyed
the sets by Charlotte and Manny, who brought us excellent hip hop and
'70s funk flavas.  The New Moon continues to chart its unpredictable and
ever-rewarding course!

We drove down to Bolinas and spent the day just hanging about and had
a couple of trips to the Bolinas Bakery, which I'd never visited but is
run by a couple of longtime Deadhead friends of mine.  The drive from
Olema to Bolinas was just amazing, running right through earthquake
country with all these little jumbled hillocks and curvy roads and the
greenest Oregon-green foliage thanks to the excess of rain over the
winter.  Finally we drove back to the City around sunset with a
spectacular view from the spine of Mt. Tam.

Saturday evening I was pretty worn so not into the expected heat and
smoke and crowding in the DV8 basement for Wicked (besides they are
coming to visit *me*, er, Portland in a couple of weeks :).  Instead 
I went to a very cool little gathering at the Cafe Bastille down in
the financial district, put together by Sunshine and Moonbeam of Dub Tribe
and Corey Black.  It's a nice place with an upstairs bar and a downstairs
dining area where the DJs were set up, including Sunshine (whose old skool
deep house set I missed) and Corey and others.  A nice house/discoey kind
of thing without the usual club attitude and the nice price of $2 . . .
I think they'll do another one like this (it was called Vanilla Fudge)
every so often.  

Sunday we made our way over to Richmond to a new site for Sunset at
Point Isabel Park, right off the Central Ave exit of 880.  What a *place*!
I liked it even more than the Marina (although the Marina has nice
features too).  It's right next to the Bay Area post office bulk mailk
center where all the mail going in and out of the area is processed.
The park itself is basically designated as a dogs-run-free thing, so
all the local dog owners were out with their canine pals running around.
Sunset was set up basically in the center of a several-acre CLOVER field.
Those who don't know, lissen up!  Clover is the BEST outdoor dancing
and hanging-out surface ever.  And this *particular* clover field faces
the Golden Gate Bridge, with a perfect view of San Francisco to the 
southwest, Marin to the Northwest and the Berkeley Hills behind.
The cops came around 5, mostly concerned about cars in the no-parking
areas around the BMC.  I won't steal Ronan's story about this from him,
but suffice it to say they talked for some time, checked out the scene
and then left once it was clear that cars would be moved where needed.
In the meantime we had beautiful sun and cool breezes and, finally, thje
sun set directly over Mt. Tam, slipping behind the peak as a great shout
went up from the massive, and then the thinnest sliver of the new moon
with the rest of the darkened disk still visible high above in the western
sky.  And Galen, Solar, John Howard (who played 'Mobilize', yay!) spinning
the good ole groovy SF zoundz.  I don't know how often this site will be
usable, there must have been 500 people and this is only the first Sunset
of the year, so handling what is inevitably going to be a bigger and 
bigger crowd is a serious issue.  I'd hate to burn out this site, perhaps
the Pacific crewe will use it sparingly this year because it's a great one!

To round out a great day, of course, the ever-reliable Libo Lounge at 
Il Pirata, it's a great way to relax and just hang out informally and
enjoy good music and dance a bit.  Don't forget to ask the bartenders
for something good to drink, you never know what they might suggest but
they're all good (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks).

Don't know when I'll be back in town, sometime soon I hope.  But it was
an eventful (sometimes amazingly so) weekend!

Hello,

SO what are your favorite Jeno DJ tapes?

Probably recent ones will be easier to find, but I'm interested in knowing
about past faves, too.

I'm especially looking for ones that are representative of his better sets at
events.

Thanks!

Okay.  Whereas action to save the old-growth forest, etc. is a positive step,
I think that Fraser's idea is more progress is made by spending one's efforts
trying to uplift people rather than trying to fix all the problems
individually (and
I definitely agree with him on this point).

I think that the only point I disagree with you on is "we are running out of 
time and space".  (And I think giving us a "50/50" chance is just being less
negative than others :-) rather than being positive).

To me any attitude or action taken because "we are running out of time
and space" is thereby happening out of fear, rather than a positive
celebration of life.  Even if only 400 people (rather than 4 billion) were
living
in negativity, the feeling of compassion would still dictate the same desire
to extend the "vibe" to them.

In the Vedas (the world's oldest known writings/sayings), time is said to
be a cycle of 4 eras or "yugas".   These eras run thousands of years.
The current one, "Kali Yuga", is the spiritually darkest era and began about
5,000 years ago or so.

I think that if one believes that mind/spirit is an accident in a material
world,
then fear always exists that it can be eliminated.
But, if one discovers that matter is just the playground of mind/spirit,
then,
as Zero the Hero says in the Planet Gong trilogy "You never blow your
trip forever".    (although you can really mess it up temporarily :-) ).

>and can help to establish the positive cooperative fun-loving
>compassionate cultural attitude that needs to become :fashionable" for the

>accept the necessary change. 

If you like I can private e-mail you some paragraphs from Newt about how he
is
trying to help establish a positive cooperative compassionate cultural 
attitude in society (he feels that the bureaucratic dispensing of compassion
in the form of money (eg the "dole") whereby the compassion is supposed
to come from people who are only interested in how long it is until 5 PM, 
doesn't work, and needs to be replaced by private volunteer action by 
people who are really interested in the disadvantaged in society).

All of this may be true but bear in mind that if your car stalls on
the train crossing, all the positivity in the world won't eave you
if you don't move the car or yourselves before the train comes, being confident
that the engineer will see you in thime (or can stop the train in time is
clearly irresponsible on your part)  Basically I think fraser is being 
optimistic when he gives us a 50/50 chance, I guess the place that we differ
is in the ultimate outcome, I believe that the planet and most of it's life 
forms WILL survive but homo sapiens may be gone. (those pesky hairless monkeys)
We humans actually believe our own bullshit and think that because we are at
the top of the food chain, that gives us some form of divinity.

Well lets be realistic, no every human will not die but we may loose 25% - 50%
of the population, It may not be so bad here in the industrialized countries
(although white folks won't be able to go outside anymore :) but in Africa
and other parts of the world it will be a living hell, where so many dead
bodies lying around that diseases will multiply and make it _very_ uncomfortable
for the people who do survive.

I think Fraser is try to get people to realize that we need more than
"good time dancing" if we want to save the planet.  Thew Dance is definitely
a ralleying point and out of that strong bonding and aliances are formed.
I think for many it was a wake up call and Gaia's last ditch effort to reach
here children before she let's her sister Kali have a go.

Umm, I don't believe so, but the most universal formats are probably 
.wav, .au, and MPEG.  These, incidentally, are the format our samples and 
most others in hyperreal's music archives are in.

> (It would be a help to me in selecting a sound card...)

This should not have too much to do with it, actually.  If you are 
worried about which formats you will be able to play/record, the software 
is the most important thing (assuming, of course, that you do not get 
shitty hardware ;), but most cards today can handle stereo/16, anyway).

The "de facto" standard audio format on the web is Sun/NeXT 8k format
(*.au). This gives pretty crappy audio quality, but it's the most 
widely used format out there on the web; most of the web browsers I've
used support this format by default... Be careful about using other
rates, since many older workstations can't support 16k, 22.05, 32k, or
44.1k sample per second sound files.

Sites like IUMA are trying to use MPEG2, but there aren't that many 
browsers set up to use this (or rather few people have the MPEG2
decoder nor have they set up their MIME types to run this decoder). I
occasionally see *.wav format "out there", but then you lose out on all
the unix boxes out there.

Your best bet is to support multiple formats for each sound byte.
Support 8k *.au format for the Unix weenies out there, *.wav for the
unwashed masses, and MPEG2 for those that want better sound quality. In
the future, we may even get the ability to automatically have the
server negotiate the kind of sound file it sends over based on  sound
playback capability information your browser sends to the server (see
also Simon Spero's MDMA web server -- Hi Simon!).... For now, you might
have something like
		Richie Hawtin's Expectorations in A-minor
			[click here to hear 8k Sun/NeXT format]
			[click here to hear WAV format]
			[click here to hear MPEG2 format]

Unfortunately, some of the better compression techniques out there,
e.g. Aware's Wavelet compression, aren't available for free, but can be
purchased for SGI workstations (with SGI's patented
shoot-yerself-in-the-foot-before-you-even-get-the-product-out-the-door
pricing structure added on to ensure that all SGI's cool software
remains out of the hands of the masses and destined for instantaneous
obscurity and obsolescense).

Coming back from a movie on Sat. nite, I heard on KCBS (740AM) that
a young man overdosed and died from taking two hits of Ecstasy at
a rave in SOMA on Friday night. His friend took one hit and was okay, but
after they returned home on Saturday morning, after a night of raving
the guy had a heart attack or something.

Does anyone know anything about this? It concerned me that one of
the few public mentions of a rave had to do with an overdose and
a death.

A friend forwarded this to me yesterday. We were both taken rather aback 
by it, given the repeated assurances of safety one hears in the scene. I'm 
pretty reluctant to take it at face value given the very general nature of 
the facts, but of course, names and places aren't necessarily likely to 
come out. I'm no pharmacologist, but it seems likely it was something 
other than E that was ingested.

Yes, it is very unfortunate that the public's knowledge of the scene is 
often limited to these sorts of incidents, often taken from very 
inaccurate reports. For that same reason, if anyone 
has any other - preferably more concrete - details, please post (with the 
sort of discretion Milton and Joe discussed recently).

take care!

Finally, more reasons why I've been saying "don't do X"  for the last
few years... too bad people have to die to provide us with evidence....

Don't believe the hype (from the religious-X-as-panacea fanatics). X
won't get rid of your colds (RE a previous ridiculous thread on this
list), it'll nuke your immune system just like any other amphetamine,
and just like coke. X won't make the world a better place -- better
people will make the world a better place... and it's hard to be better
when you're dead or ill. Amphetamines are amphetamines no matter which
way you slice them... Wanna find out how wonderful these speedy things
are for you -- read David Crosby's autobiography, or take a look at his
liver...

Your momma,

I got a call from a friend of mine in the SF Bay area this morning.  A 
friend of his went to a rave last night where he bought and took a hit of 
X. An hour later he wasn't feeling much, so he bought and took another. 
Effects hit him shortly thereafter. Early this morning, he walked into 
his kitchen and passed out. His roommate came to find him puking blood 
all over the place. He called an ambulance, and then when he found that 
he had no more pulse, he tried resuscitation. By the time the ambulance 
arrived, he was dead.

It sounds to me like he ingested ground glass. That would explain the
puking of blood. But why would he knowingly ingest ground glass?

Ok so after your friend went to the hospital, and some professionals 
gave him the "look over" why did he really die? Don't just reply, 
"because of the e". Blood from the stomach? or lungs? Sounds like more 
than the e was affecting him. Did he take anything else???

Sorry to hear about the loss of your friend, Jay. For a long time,
people thought that these deaths were a strictly British phenonenon,
and were related to heatstroke. Personally, I've always doubted that
thesis, and suspect that it was simply that more people were doing 
more of it here than anywhere else.

There just doesn't seem any way of predicting who might fall foul of
this horrible phenomenon. People who are going to take MDMA had better
be aware that this outcome is always a possibility, and is much less 
rare than people like to imagine.

Puking blood? Never heard anything like this. Did he also take other drugs
(alcohol, or smoked coke or speed, or something else)? Can you give a
medical reference for this? (Name of doctor in charge, his name)?

Since many people asked about this, let me clarify some things. First of 
all, I did not personally know the person that died last weekend. He was 
a close friend of one of my close friends. 

Now why is it important who the doctor was. By the time the ambulance 
arrived at the guy's place, he was already dead. BTW, this story made the 
news in San Francisco (and California), so anyone who wants "official" 
information, check the library. But he did not take anything else other 
than those two tablets, and six or seven hours later he was puking blood 
and died. 

Some people on here seem to take it for granted that drugs can be safe if 
taken responsibly. But remember that the people who make these outside 
the law don't have the same responsibilities. Perhaps the tablets he took 
weren't really MDMA. (I hear that most of the stuff that shows up at 
raves as "X" is actually speed or heroin.) Or maybe they were MDMA, and 
he unfortunately ODed or had an allergic reaction. I'm sure he wasn't the 
only one at the rave who took one of those particular tablets.

The point is that one shouldn't trust something they aquired from a 
stranger at a rave. I would never buy any drugs at a rave, but then 
again, I tend to stay away from synthetic drugs these days. Nothing but 
greens, mushrooms, and yeast-piss for me.

Puking blood might be from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) which
is a documented problem with MDMA, although very rare.

Judging by the replies in this thread, I can see that MDMA users in 
the USA are _still_ in denial about this increasingly frequent 
reaction to the drug.

It doesn't need anything more than the 'e'. For some people, this
just happens. There have been at least 30 cases in the UK in the
last few years -- possibly more.

Okay, lets get one thing straight.......
There is no heroine in tabs passed as E, it doesn't make sense to put

would make the tabs very very expensive to produce, so you'd be much 
better off just selling the smack, you'd make much more money....

The possiblity of this guy death being related to an alergic reaction is 
very possible. about 250,000 people die each year from perscription and 
OTC drugs in the US each year, MDMA is a very safe drug, very few ppl are 
actually allergic to it but it does happen, shit I've heard of death from 
asprin. So with out the death certificate or medical report ther're is no 
way of knowing what really happened but don't jump to the conclusion MDMA 
is a bad drug.... it's not....
There is an inherent risk with taking any drug, from asprin to heroine.

I bet it _was_ MDMA. It sounds like a classic example of death from
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation -- ie, your body overheats and
you start suffering from massive internal haemmoraging. I would also
bet that if someone was taken to a US hospital in this state, the A & E
crews wouldn't have the first idea how to respond.

If somebody that you know has a convulsion or passes out on MDMA, it is
vital that you try to keep their body temperature down. Call an 
ambulance immediately, and keep the body cool by sponging them with
iced water till the ambulance arrives, and tell them that you suspect
DIC from MDMA. It could save someone's life (and most people who get
this have died)

Ummm... just wondering, but did any other acquaintances of this friend also 
ingest any of this suspect "e", or just this person?  I suspect that it is 
also possible that what was sold to him as "e" was in fact some adulterated 
product... which is one of the reasons I myself avoid anything synthetic 
besides blotter acid.  This paranoia stems from a few "double-barrel hits of 
white mesc" I got a few years ago that actually felt like Strychnine.  
Needless to say, since then I haven't touched "mesc", and although sure, maybe 
blotter could be adultered or misrepresented DOB, etc, I still feel the threat 
of a lethal dose of something is much less...

It sounds like you are an insensitive, ignorant pud.  There are plenty of

I'm with you.  It's astounding how many people think that psychoactive drugs

First off, this was not a "story." This was very, very real, and a

He didn't, and neither does anyone else who buys drugs at raves.

No, he only had those two tablets.

I don't know.

No, I seriously doubt that. He wasn't a newcomer to drugs.

This was not a "horror story." Seems like you're in complete denial about 
the dangers inherent with taking drugs that were illegaly manufactured 
by a stranger.

I'm glad you find your sources trustworthy.

I never said there was. But "X" or "E" or however it shows up at raves is
not always in tablet form. I've seen "X" snorted, and that could be any
number of drugs. As for the tablets, it's quite possible to put anything
other than MDMA on them.

As the thread Neils posted indicates, this is a case where many people are
jumping to conclusions despite the lack of a full set of facts.  This is
certainly a tragedy, and I don't want to minimize that, but it seems most
unlikely that E was directly responsible for this person's death, although
it could have been a contributing factor.  The disseminated intravascular
coagulation effect seems more likely to occur when ventilation conditions
are poor and a person has overheated by dancing or other movement and not
drinking enough fluids.  But from the limited details reported here, it
appears that this person collapsed well after taking the E, probably well
after it had mostly metabolized, and at home rather than in a crowded,
hot club or warehouse.

Having seen some medical emergencies at events recently, it is important
to me anyway to be very careful about speculating as to causes and effects
without knowing the full story.  The characteristics of E and other drugs
are well established and documentation is widely available.  Not everyone
responds to any given substance or dosage level the same, not at all. 
And some people suffer dangerous reactions to things that don't affect
others.  This isn't just true of psychoactive drugs; I have a friend who
is so allergic to peanuts and other legumes that she could die if she ate
too many.  But one of the widely reported characteristics of E is that
it is considered relatively safe because the level at which unpleasant
but not dangerous reactions occur is well below the toxicity level.  

This is *not* to say that E or any other such drug is *safe*.  But the
particulars of the situation and contributing factors are at least as
important as the drug itself in the reported medical problems and 
fatalities that have occurred in conjunction with its use.

We owe it to ourselves to learn the facts about these matters so we can
recognize the danger signs when they occur in ourselves or our friends,
and know how to respond.

It's not appropriate to speculate about this unfortunate person's death.  
The thread you included makes it clear that X is risky; however, there is 
risk in just about anything worthwhile.  We need harm reduction, not 
scare stories.

I was wondering if anyone knew if this person had tried e before.  It is
possible that he had an allergic reaction to it.  Ecstasy may be illegal,
but it is almost as safe a drug as Tylenol, or milk for that matter.
Nobody knows what they are allergic to until they actually try a substance.
A friend of mine almost died when he was younger because he had a similar
reaction to milk.

What does make ecstasy from the black market unsafe are the extras that
manufacturers put into the tablets.  It could be adulterated with multiple
products.  However, it does not make sense for people to put shit like
heroin or a whole lot of speed into it.  Or crushed glass.  Who the hell
would take the time to crush glass so finely that he could make pills out
of it?  Why waste the effort?  And why drive up the cost of manufacture
with other expensive drugs like heroin, when a good starch filler will take
up the same space for a lot less money?

Anyway, getting off track.  This is one of the FEW ecstasy related deaths.
Unfortunately, media tends to focus on all that is bad in this world.  All
we will ever see on tv are the deaths from the drugs.  Never will the faces
of thousands of happy raving people be displayed on tv, for that would be
promoting the lifestyle of a censored subculture.  It is no of use for us
to create a mass scare about ecstacy.  You have as high a chance of dying
due to allergic reactions to prescription or OTC drugs.

We are constantly being fed biased information by society and government
like this every day.  Another example is with HIV(which doesn't really
pertain to ecstasy, but proves my point).  the Centers for Disease Control
have chosen not to publicize that the chance of getting HIV in heterosexual
males having unprotected sex is roughly 1 in 700, while in women it is 1 in
500.  A lot lower than the media would like you to believe, although still
a dangerous level. What would happen if the truth were known?  A lot more
unprotected sex.  This is the same reason we are not given a full
description of effects of ecstacy on users.

Well, i think that's enough for me.  Just remember to treat information
from the media as a viewpoint from a biased source.  If you want a more
impartial view, go to the library and check out a *bunch* of the latest
articles on the subjects of your choice.  Listen to the hype, but use your
head and the resources around you to check things out.

Luv y'all,

Keep in mind it's also assumed that what these poor people ingested was 
actually "E" when it could have been anything sold as E. Like Phred says, 
it's doubtful that the direct cause was the E.

on sat morning a reporter called us and wanted to know if we could tell him 
something about a girl who had died of ecstacy at a rave on valencia. Andrew 
told him we knew that the press would intentionally create a story bashing 
raves. The next day a marin press, which we only heard about from a friend, 
reported a story about the death of a male and interviews with a parent.
The reporter tried to convince us that it was not going to be rave bashing. 
He was very slimey as reporters tend to be and we could tell him nothing 
anyway. I would like to know if anyone knows any first hand info or if 
someone could post the article (a paper from marin).

This might become non-SFR relevant soon, but I think any interested parties
should look at the MDMA FAQ on hyperreal. While MDMA is in the amphetamine
family, it's methods of action are quite different than those of plain
amphetamine, methamphetamine, and other stimulants and has different
physical effects on your body. Indeed, MDMA affects different
neurotransmitters and receptors than most other amphetamines. (serotonin as
opposed to dopamine) I know of no studies that indicate that MDMA is as
toxic as amphetamines and it is generally not used in the same patterns as
other amphetamines (i.e. increasing dosages and frequency of use leading to
heightened physical and mental stress) due to tolerence to it's
empathogenic effects.

A decision to use any drug needs to be made responsibly, however,
generalizations may only confuse the issue.

As far as the tragedy this past weekend goes, to much information is
missing for any of us to come to any conclusions just yet. Until the
specific drug(s) he ingested has been identified and any pre-existing
conditions have been ruled out, it might be wise to hold off on making
judgements.

That may be true, but there were also a whole slew of sicknesses/deaths a
couple years back when people had severe allergic reactions to a non-dairy
creamer that was supposedly tested and safe.  I know that Ecstacy, or any
other drug for that matter, is not 100% safe.  There is a risk involved in
everything we do.  I just think that people are jumping to conclusions that
e kills everyone dead.  Make sure to know about what you are using if you
do use.  There are a lot of good articles at the library for everyone to
read.

Niels,

What you just posted just chewed up bandwidth on the net.  Has little to no
facts.  There was no actual cause of death attached to those facts.  E is only
peripherally involved until medical examiners have determined the cause
of death.  The only thing you have proven at this point is your ability to
cause mass hysteria.

I respect your personal conviction that E is not a good drug for you for X and
Y reasons.  But respect others convictions that it is an enhancing drug for
them.  There is absolutely no reason for you to sit up on your pedestal and
preach to the masses.

Sorry had to vent frustration,

Ron.

Hate to revive a long dead thread, but a while back we were talking about
using noise cancelling technology (i.e., speakers using negative phasing) to
block the thump heard on the street generated by a rave.  It seemed too
difficult to use outdoors at the time.  Now I see that BART is using this
technology to silence the noise made by its cars on portion of track.  So
maybe someday...

Yes, one of the few, but nonetheless a tremendous tragedy for the
person and his family and friends (I'm starting to gather this story is
correct in the outcome, if not the cause). Phred's post brought that back 
into perspective for me. Even one avoidable death is too many.

Yes, the mainstream media distorts and promotes the negative. However, 
most of the supposedly objective literature I've read would have you 
believe that the only side-effects you'll ever experience are a sore jaw 
from E and an upset stomach from 'shrooms. I'd hate to find myself 
parroting this in a moment of hightened enthusiasm to a first-timer 
friend.

Now that summer's arriving and things are getting underway, would
some "knowlegable" person care to post a list of reasonable dangers 
and how to watch out for or react to them? Or perhaps a just pointer to a
WWW/FTP source?

Thanks!

Disclaimer: What follows is a bit off point from the E thread and you may 
already know this but...

Please please be careful out there, no matter what drug you're taking. 
Even if you're prescribed something, don't assume that the doctor knows 
what s/he is doing. I was prescribed Inderal (a beta-blocker) a few years 
ago. Twenty minutes after I had taken it, I had a full-on convulsion on a bus. 
I'll skip the gory details, but suffice to say my doctor had made a huge 
mistake - one that cost me a transfusion and four days in the hospital 
and nearly my life.  In hindsight, I wish I had asked more questions, 
read up on the drug and trusted my own intuition about what was going on 
with my body. I'm not standing on a soapbox here, nor am I castigating 
all doctors. I just hope sharing my experience can be helpful.  

You're all precious. Please take care of yourselves.

Love,
Kathryn

While it may be true that MDMA is unlikely to cause toxic effects directly,
the book E is for Ecstasy (the entire text is available at hyperreal) has
extensive discussion of the medical problems associated with its use.
Generally, it appears to be quite safe (safer, for example, than skiing,
in terms of mortality-per-million uses), and while the toxicity (LD50)
level is fairly low, cases of people taking the equivalent of several
dozen doses with no lasting effects have been recorded.  Generally, taking
more than a couple times the typical dosage level, according to the
literature, produces enough uncomfortable "speedy" effects that people
aren't tempted to severely overdose in any event.  

The biggest problem area is the question of overheating (or probably much
more rarely, overchilling).  Both lab studies and general observation
indicate that people react less strongly to heat or cold while on E, and
that can be dangerous in cases where strenuous exercise and lack of fluid
intake can trigger collapses or even death.  The following excerpt from
E is for Ecstasy gives a synopsis of this:

E Is for Ecstasy, Appendix 1, Reference 51
 
Toxicity and deaths from MDMA from The Lancet by John Henry et al. August 1992
 
...
 
Reports from the USA suggested MDMA was only mildly toxic. The main cause
of death was cardiac arrhythmias; rhabdomyolysis and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC). Most cases the authors were consulted
about had mild symptoms. There was a clear pattern of toxicity in the most
severe cases. Death was probably due to heatstroke "in which severe
hypothermia was accompanied by DIC". There was no evidence of drug impurity
being responsible for toxicity. All fatalities occurred after the user had
been at a crowded party or club. Sustained physical activity, high ambient
temp, inadequate fluid replacement could all reduce heat loss and the
direct effect of the drug may upset the thermoregulatory mechanism.
The authors conclude that MDMA is capable of causing severe toxicity and
that the pattern of acute toxicity witnessed in the series of cases studied
may be due mainly to the circumstances in which it is misused.

------

I really suggest looking at the entire section on MDMA
effects on the body in the E is for Ecstasy text.  Although people often
report that the MDMA in a supposed E dose has been "cut" with other
substances, the very limited reports in the literature indicate this is
probably rare, and it would be much more frequent to get a completely
different drug such as MDA being sold as E -- and then you could have
some serious side effects and health problems, especially if the person
is not prepared for that prospect.

The only "rave" happening in SOMA on Saturday night that I know about was
Wicked in the basement of DV8, so I don't know if this was the event
referred to, but regardless of that, it is surely a warning once again
to all of us to "be careful out there" and watch for the warning signs
in ourselves or others and be prepared to help when needed.

see ya

> What you just posted just chewed up bandwidth on the net.

No, sounds more like you're grasping at straws for reasons to dismiss
my posting. I figured those w/o news access might be interested in a
summary of the posts that have transpired on this case. Yes, I
editorialized, as I often like to do... Don't like it? Hit delete now!

IMHO, the subject seems alot more relevant to raving than the 500
messages of mostly bullshit, that I had to wade through after I got
back from vacation. (And too much of that bullshit was people posting
about what people shouldn't post about -- the bandwidth wasted on
people getting all huffy about that dwarfed the bandwidth of any
off-topic posts...)

> Has little to no facts.  There was no actual cause of death attached to
> those facts.

What the hell is a fact? People used to think that it was a "fact" that
X rays, ultraviolet radiation, nuclear radiation, or pregnancy hormones
like DES were harmless. Facts are only as deep as our understanding,
and our understanding, pro-X or con-X are very very limited. Yes, we
may know the minutiae of how X affects us at a neuronal level
(serotonin this versus dopamine that). But, I  maintain, such minutiae
are irrevelvant when looking at the overall systemic, immune, or
hormonal effects of X. We still understand very little about that. So
don't blow "facts" at me.... Just cuz the facts don't fit your belief
doesn't mean the info was irrelevant.

Also, what of the "facts" of all the X related deaths (admittedly from
overheating) in the UK. What of the "facts" presented in the postings
mentioning DIC? Seems like those are good "facts" for people to know.

And whose facts are you believing? I've read parts of various pro-X
books like "E is for Ecstacy" and much of it reads like a bunch of spew
from a religious tractate (selective quoting from scientific articles).
Much of the "literature" that people point to in claiming that X is
100% safe seems to lack objectivity. It's easy to preach to the
converted, but that shit don't pass for "science"... It's bad science
to just look for the positives suporting your point, and skip,
gloss-over, or minimize any negatives.

> I respect your personal conviction that E is not a good drug for you for X and
> Y reasons.  But respect others convictions that it is an enhancing drug for

Since when does expressing an opinion equate to lack of respect?  Or is
it somehow uncool to post opinions that are politically incorrect here?
Is "respect" to you making me your "yes man" -- if so, I politely
request your permission to diss-respect you. 

I, for one, am getting real sick of hearing about "respect" because,
IMHO, it is often just a code word for "don't rock my boat"... But it's
not like I'm calling you a worthless slob or anything, I'm just
expressing an opinion about a topic, intellectually. If you disagree,
then fine, you disagree, tell me why. But don't lay this "respect" crap
on me cuz I'll just laugh back.... The day we can't express opinions 
for fear of "lack of respect" is the day we might as well roll up and
die, because that's a big part of being intelligent and human.
 
I know lots of people that do X and I sometimes tell them what I think
and many still do X (and many are still friends). My opinion is that
people get a bit too dreamy in the shorts when describing how wonderful
X is, and they seem to lose objectivity. Yeah, and I was totally
dissing that stupid thread a while back about how people were claiming
that X had cured them of their colds, because I think that's a big load
of hooey, in my not so humble opinion (IMNSHO).

--------------------

I first did X back when it was legal, it was real, it was interesting.
But for me, I have a been there, done that attitude (aka learning,
experience) about my past experiences that lead me to believe it isn't
a very good enchancer. For the following reasons:

(0) X is too expensive. Fuck designer fashions.
(1) The effects wear out over time, your 100th trip won't be anything
    like the first, or even the tenth. (So you end up upping the dosage
    and eventually incur the risk of ODing...).
(2) The crap that passes for X nowadays is a joke. It's much like playing
    russian roulette.
(3) X makes me depressed and emotionally listless afterwards, and you're 
    wading into dangerous addiction territory if you need to do more X to
    make yourself feel ok...  (i've spoken to a handful of people that feel
    the same way).
(4) I have seen empirical evidence indicating that X fucks w/ your immune 
    system, leaving you susceptible to colds, flu, bronchitis/pneumonia, 
    and making recovery a lot slower than normal. (Why is it that so many
    X users are perpetually sick or recovering from "nasty colds")...
(5) I watched some heavy users in college lose much of their emotional affect
    for an extended period of time (like 1 year). They eventually became
    fun to be around (aka normal) again once they stopped using/abusing X.
(6) Emotional hallucinogens are a bad way to fall in love/like. Because when
    you're down, you may still think you're in love/like, but the reasons for
    feeling that way turn out to be nothing but a mirage. I'd rather be
    a bit more objective and sober when investigating love/sex/friendship.

These are opinions, and you are free to ignore them, or whatever. I
really don't care. The only facts I ever write are programmatic source
code. Everything else is by definition an opinion, because facts are
slippery business.

Some information I came across:

E - is well known for having a low LD-50 (lethal dose 50) which means that
the dose at which its effective is pretty close to the dose at which 50% of
the rats in your control group die.

Two tabs of pure MDMA could probably kill you, which is why they say its a
good idea to administer E in the following way:

Instead of swallowing a whole lot of the substance, snort a small amount
thereby administering the substance directly to the right place, and
avoiding high dosage.

Always wait a while to monitor effects.

Never take another E, just because you're having a great time on the first dose.

Try to keep the dosage as low as possible.

Charlie Grof, one of the few people doing MDMA research reccomends that you
take an antioxidant as well, like betacaratene, vit e, to minimise dentrite
collapse. (yes, you can flatten dentrites with high doses)

- also be very careful of taking anything from a stranger, or ingesting any
substance you're not sure of.

Just say KNOW.

I like a lot of what Neils has to say on this.  I'd only point out a
couple of things.  First, MDMA is not merely anecdotally an immune
suppressant, this has been widely reported in the literature and again
anecdotally from my friends and FOAFs who get "raver flu" sometimes
after doing it.  But it happens also with pot and alcohol and lots of
other things.  

I also disagree somewhat with the characterization of E Is for Ecstasy
as merely a pro-X "spew" selectively quoting the literature.  This may
be true of certain other well-known books about this substance, but my
reading of it is that it is very fair and reasonably complete in its
coverage and conclusions.  This book certainly does *not* claim that
MDMA is 100% safe (as the excerpt I posted just now indicates).

The point is, we are not dealing with an unknown here.  There is plenty
of readily-available documentation on the benefits, drawbacks and even
dangers of this substance, as there are with many others we may encounter
directly or indirectly through the experiences of our friends and
acquaintances.  

I don't happen to agree with Neils' essentially negative opinion of MDMA,
but I greatly respect that opinion and I think he laid out some clear
reasons for why he holds it.  All of these things are worth considering
when deciding what we are going to do in regard to this whole issue.

Ob:rave, MDMA has been and continues to be a part of this scene, but it
is not the defining characteristic that the media seem to want it to be,
nor was it ever, even back in the day of 1991 (or 1987 if you were in
the UK).  And this is not surprising -- not all Deadheads have taken
acid, despite what you'd think from what is said in the media.  I'm
Exhibit No. 1 in that regard.  But there's no question that acid put its
stamp on the Dead as a musical outfit and on the Deadhead scene in
general, just as X has done with the house/techno/rave/underground.
So, regardless of whether we do this particular substance ourselves,
it is something we have to deal with for our own understanding of what
it is we're involved with, and to respond appropriately when the media
comes calling as it did with Ameba this weekend.

And every so often we are faced with a true tragedy within our scene.
At times like these, for surely one or more of the people on this list
knew the person who died this weekend, knowing about these things makes
it much easier to comprehend their meaning and to take the necessary
steps to minimize the loss of health or even life that can happen, so
ironically and arbitrarily, in a scene devoted to the proposition that
we support *life*.

nice letter.
one tip for dealing with people on bad trips that' I've picked up over 
the years:  try to sit the person down (not totally necessary) and 
looking in the general direction of something nice, a mountain, a painting 
etc (but a boring wall can do as well) and then say:  look at that [?].  
did you ever see such an interesting [?]  isn't it beautiful, amazing 
whatever.  the point is to get themoff their negative track and into a 
more positive one.  doesn't always work but often does.

ken, to take the only point on which you disagree (2 actually):
we *are* running out of time.  and space.  in the old days ( at least 
till all your foremothers came out here to america) there was enough 
space that if things got bad enough in this valley with all the greed and 
powerheads the intelligent sensitive and cooperative could always move to 
the next valley.  now there are no valleys left.  ipso we have run out of 
time and space.  now our species has to change or die. 
I think we have a slightly better than even chance of changing.  and I'm 
not doing it out of fear.  before Rc spontaneously combusted, during the 
"wildereness years" of the '80s when the world was just quietly 
disappearing down the plughole and nobody seemed to give a fuck) I was 
(more or less) content to live gracefully on little funds and just write 
privately. (except that I started the Encyclopaedia Psychedelica 
Internztional a few years before it erupted, prediciting that a "new wave 
of consciousness is about o break out among youth" - this is all well 
documented)  now I'm full of *hope*.
the reason I say the odds are about even is because so-called "spiritual 
types will often tell you that it's all outside our control, that the 
goddess (or Truth or Spirit or Rhythm or  whatever) will sort it all out 
and all we have to do is polish our inner mirror or whatever.  I don't 
believe that.  nobody knows any of this for sure but I judge a 
pilosophical viewpoint by its likely effect on people.  telling folks 
that they don't have to do anything doesn't strike me as healthy.  and 
besides, I believe we *are* the goddess - her finest blossoms. and *we* 
the goddess in each of us is gonna sort things out now, having learned 
only too well the folly of competitiveness.
ok?  >:-)
fraser
PS  just beause I don't use the word spiritual etc don't get the idea k'm 
an atheist or I see matter as primary because I'm not and I don't. in 
mahayana buddhism (which was a reaction to the long-established but 
mostly then corrupt hindu "religion") there comes a stage where you have 
to "get rid of the stench of enlightenbment".  >:-)))))

it is.  here's one way I make the point sometimes:  which would please 
the goddess more - to spend 3 hours a month recycling your garbage or 
spend the same three hours calling people in the phone directory 
persuading *them* to do it?  not the best example, I'm sure, but phun.

or how about:  RAVE LOCALLY SAVE GLOBALLY  ?  hence:  Raving the Planet.

nor will "goddess"  "Truth" or "Rhythm" save your car.  you gotta do it,
whether you're imperfect and not very spiritually advanced, and
whether you're indestructible like some assume the goddess/planet is. (the
simile is with the planet situation today, of course.)

not divinity, responsibility.  and I'd love to hear a scenario where the

every living thing *survives* except them.  it won't do (despite some 
well meaning eological warriors saying it).  the fifth principle of the

this is one for david dei.  I think he'll say (and I'll agree) that 
things will be a *lot* worse in the west.  a *lot* worse.  
and I would add:  who will earth people *blame*?  and what will happen 
then?  and what will happpen here if "25-50%" of humanity dies (it's 
probably already well on its way)  and once the culture breaks down into 
opposing sides burdened by guilt and outrage ...?

I'll make it easy for people. I'll write responses to all topics in one
message.

RE:x-overdose

two views x is bad-there have not been enough studies done on the
psycological aspects of x-ing. All drugs are bad. Even too much vitamin
C can cause a urinary tract infection. To much salt causes premature
high blood pressure.

x is ok- like any other substance our bodies are designed to handle
abuse from drugs such as x. But these things are best taken in
moderation. Besides if you wait a long time before each dose (more than
2 months) I've heard that only one dose is more than enough to get you
going all night. Someone posted something about MDMA is not the same as
MD with MA (the whole is not as bad as the sum of its parts)wrong. I
talked to my uncle(a pharmasict and instructor) and he said that
whenever you have an accelerator with a mind altering drug, It has the
same effects to the body(raising temp., high blood press.........) but
it does something worse. It increses the amount of brain damage. even
candy can cause brain damamge though. BE SAFE. USE IN MODERATION. DRINK
LOTSA WATER.(Even if you dont take drugs)


RE: SUNSET

I'll make this simple. WOW.

It was a lot of fun and I just liked being there for the sunset itsself.
It looks like all of you would agree. This is a start to a great summer.
I didn't see one frown the whole day. I met Bryce, Andrew Lawson,
Ethan..... and someothers whos names I have written down but they are in
my car.(SORRY) but anyways. Time for bed

LOVE YOU ALL

I'd *guess* that the black propaganda has begun. it started in the UK 3
years ago and the govt started publishing the number of deaths thru
ecstasy.  Zippy Times did a study of the first 8 deaths and we found that
*none* of them were caused by ecstasy - car crashes, loadsa booze & other
drugs, falling off rooves etc.  I actually appeared on a tv program in
Manchester with the mother of a boy who had supposedly died on e. a
difficult appearance, I'll tell you, but the truth was her son was doing
*lots* of different drugs, most of them more dangerous than e. 

not to say that ecstasy is not quite toxic on the body - it is. and then
there's the thing about dehydration, no water available at raves etc

fraser

PS  I don't know what kind of radio station KCBS is but it might be a good 
idea for someone to give them a call and see where they got their story 
from.  a hospital?  a govt agency?  a "dodgy" press company?  the bloke 
he was with?  if the facts turn out to be inconclusive it *might* be a 
good idea to let the station know that hundreds of thousands of young 
people don't need BAD unresearched information, especially on a saturday 
night.
these are all just off-the-hip reactions, of course, maybe it *is* 
genuine, in which case we thank the station for its good work.

started off the weekend at freaky at komotion.  weird crowd.  it's sposed 
to be a queer space but a possibly confused straight guy came up to a 
(queer) friend of mine and exclaimed, "Where are all the girls?!"  back 
pain was bad so i was cranky, but i wound up having fun hanging out 
behind the bar and then working the bar (and i even got a tip!)  left 
when bryce was done with his set - he had played some bizarre DJAX 
techno, and then lots of latin house and somewhat poppish stuff.  have to 
congratulate him for getting the mostly standing-around-smoking crowd 
dancing for a bit, tho'.  

saturday i hadn't planned to go out but i heard about a small event 
starting at 4:00 byt he beach so i went to check it out.  gorgeous 
sunset, but no soundsystem, and then no speaker cables.  the organizers 
did a ritual for shiva, tho', with lots and lots of flowers.  it was nice 
to be at a party starting with a ritual.  but it was cold, so we left.

sunday was sunset, but first a VICIOUS attack of pms, so i didn't feel 
very social (an understatement - at one point i wanted to sacrifice the 
most annoyingly perky raver), but i went.  and again i remembered that 
marijuana IS medicinal :).  nice site (point isabel in richmond).  i 
found the music pretty boring, tho', but this is IMHO (i like a basic 
house groove, but not for more than half an hour.)  thought i heard some 
acid as we were leaving (just after sunset), but i wasn't sure.  nice to 
watch the cops come and go :).  

but one complaint: i thought sunset was s'posed to be a park clean-up.  
the site certainly looked a bit trashed as we were leaving.  (and it's 
frustating to be a virgo and not be able to bend down and pick up trash!  
i DID pick up a diazepan (valium) wrapper as we were leaving.  thought it 
was really tacky that it was there in the first place.)  anyway, maybe 
the message needs to be made more clear to some kids - like, if it's a 
park clean-up the least one could do is not trash the place!  hope it 
wasn't just ann and the sunset people left dealing with it at the end...

looking forward to bleeding

Dear All;

	Offering 1st Aid Services at raves, and when I saw this
immediately called the E/R at John Muir Trauma Center, Walnut Creek and
Posion Control at the 800 number and this is what these two conservative,
but very reliable sources told me, contraindications for amphetamines: 

	1. Anyone with a known or unknown cirrulaorty system defect.
		Heart Attack
		Stroke
		Heart Defect
		Hypertension....etc

	2. People cuurently, or recently taking MAO-Innibitors

	3. People with a known or unknown allergenic reaction to amphetamines

	Amphetamine overdoses is usually chacracterized by hot dry, skin, 
rapid pulse, dehydration ..etc, and can lead to heart attack, stroke, 
hypertension, tack-a-car-di-a, kidney/renal failaure due to rapid muscle 
fiber breakdown. These symtoms mentioned above can happen in a subject 
who has ingested amphetamine for up to 24 hours after inital ingestion. 
An overdose is consituted by/as anyone using the drug for recreational 
use. This means they consider one E pill an overdose, or one line no 
matter how small.

	AS far as vomiting blood, don't believe the hype, only if the 
subject ingested a lot, grams, and grams.

	I strongly encourage hot and heavy debate on this topic and how 
it effects us, ravers, users of a lot of amphetamines. Please do detailed 
research siting your sources as I have done here, get the facts as they 
pertain to you, PLEASE!!!!!!! 

	I want to meet you all with a smile on you face, not in tears, and 
scared that your gonna die. THanks

		Peace & LOve From Across Cyberspace

ps If you are gonna trash me on this one make sure you site your source, 
I will more than happy to admit I made a mistake when it comes to peoples 
lives.

Yes X does cause epolepcy which is why if you are a known epoleptic you 
should NEVER take X.  But the problem is that a lot more people have some 
form of epolepcy then they realize because they think that all fit's 
consist of a person rithing around on the floor with white foam coming out 
of their mouth's.  This is only in extreame cases usually you just feel 
a bit giddy for a while.  But this is when you are not on X; because when 
you do have a fit on X it is as above but you are bleeding instead.  This 
is what obviously happened to the man in question.
I know this from my own personal experience too.  When I used to live in 
London I used to sell X for a living.  Once I was at a festival where I 
sold some X and forty minutes later I looked over on the dance floor and 
noticed that he was rithing around on floor in pain and week blood was 
coming out of his mouth.  All the other raver's stood around not knowing 
what to do but I went in their, turned him on back, pinned his arms be 
hind him and sat on him in such a way that he could not move; this way 
he could not injure himself and there was no danger of him chocking on his 
own blood.  I kept the person in that position for the duration of the 
fit and told somebody else to go and call for an ambulance.  This is the 
correct thing to do when some body is having an epololeptic fit and every 
raver should know what to do.  
Remember: epoleptivc fit's can be easilly tested for by a doctor and I 
urge anyone who is taking lots of X to go and get themselves checked 
out.  Because you may have always been epoleptic but it was to minute for 
you to notice until you started taking X which puts a great strain on 
one's nurological system which will agrivate your epolepcy.  Also: watch 
about for strobe lights because they too can bring on fits, especially when 
you are on X because UV lights are that more intense.
Remember: this info about epolepcy is important because this, together 
with de-hydration, are two main thing's that people die of when they are 
on X.  Dispite the media telling you otherwise none has ever died from 
taking X or overdosing on it (and by X I mean pure MDMA).  Providing you 
take precautions and educate and regulate yourself X can be one of the 
most amazing experiences going.
Tristan.

Dear All;


	I was just looking at the Hyperreal information on
X/Amphetamines/Overdose, and does concur with the information I received
from the "conservative health care community", its good information,
refering to the facts, they basically say the same thing, rhadomyolysis is
the proper name for kidney/renal failure. Again the only way according to
them that someone would vomit blood is if they ingested grams, and grams, 
or if the person had an ulcer, and did the above mentioned to a lesser 
degree.

Sincerely
B. Darkness

ps I still want to see people read it for themselves, PLEASE, Its your 
life!!!!

I believe it's around 30 deaths since 1988. I'm pretty sure (i could get 
the correct statistics) that only 4 were allergic reactions, most were 
from dehydration and eating things that weren't mdma. It's a fact. There 
were no cases where they took 'too much ecstasy' and died.

That's why you buy from people you trust, you know what you're getting, 
you are assured that you're not getting chalk dust...

When someone is having an epileptic seizure, it is very important to 
protect their head so they don't end up with a concussion or worse.  This 
is more important then pinning their arms behind them.  One should also 
be careful when sitting on someone, which can make it difficult to 
breath.  Never put your finger in their mouth to try and keep them from 
swallowing their tongue, because you may only have nine left when its over.

Uh, would you mind citing your sources? I've never heard MDMA has a
particularly low LD50. And saying "two tabs...could probably kill you" is
totally subjective. The effects are based on dosage in relation to body
weight, so a mg/kg ratio would be preferred if giving such info. All
quantitative and qualitative reports I've heard regard snorting indicate
it's not the most desirable way to administer the drug. Absorbtion by the
mucuos membrane occurs more quickly than abbsorbtion through the stomach,
but the effects are much shorter in duration. I don't see how the mucuos
membrane is the "right place." Its effects take place in the brain, not the
nose.

Okay everyone--we all know that DIC is a potential danger involved for
anyone who uses e, and to pretend that it doesn't exist--no matter to what
extent--is naive.  I'm new to this scene; I've been to 2 raves and just 
subscribed to this list, but it still amazes me how rabidly people 
dismiss associated dangers.  Does "The government" (isn't it funny how 
people assume the government is a single entity?) dispense misleading 
information on drugs' effects?  Of course it does, and for understandable
reason--more drugs mean more hassles for the government to deal with: car 
crashes, emergency room visits, etc.  Even if the percentage of users 
experiencing problems is small, if the number of users increases, so too must
the number (in strictly raw terms) of accidents.  On the other extreme stands
the drug enthusiast, whose information is also often biased, but this time
in the opposite direction: "ecstasy is like aspirin" and "too much water 
will kill you if you drink enough" as well as other absurdities.
My point is that knowledge is power.  Don't dismiss the weekend's 
tragedy; ask as many questions as you can think of and don't belittle others
for asking irrelevant questions.  My question, then, is this--does anyone
know of anti-coagulants that ravers can take to minimize risk?  Will water
act as an effective combattant against DIC, or are there better solutions
(pun intended :) ) out there?  If anyone is a biologist or a med student, 
please post... I'm just a dumb english major! :) 
Peace and love and eternal grooving,
starbursts and pacifiers to all,
timothy

	This is purely a case of "perceived value"...
	you perceive it as expensive.. you don't buy it.
	Some others dont see it that way.

True. But it`s up to *you* to increase the the dose.. With a little discipline
you won't. You'll ease up. Or settle for less of a "high". Most people I
know do this.

In some cases .. not all. Be a "smart shopper" if u need to.

Maybe true for you. But the only person that I know that had that effect
was someone who was depressed before taking the drug.. and found the
difference between the "high" and his "depression" to be excessive, therefore
making him feel even more depressed after taking the drug. You do raise
the interesting point of "psychological addiction" in that we may be 
un-interested in doing things, e.g., going to raves, *without* the drug..
because we may believe it's a hell of a lot more fun with it than without it.
But that's not much different that any drug like pot and alcohol.

Could be true. But, think about what ravers are doing. Staying up all nite,
missing sleep. Dancing in a germ-filled sweatbox for 8 hours. Sharing water
bottles... can you separate the ill-effects of the drug from those other
possible causes?

Certainly. But you are emphasizing the negative side of that coin. 
There is a positive side also, i.e., breaking down inhibitions.. etc.
Of course this can get u in trouble, as you mentioned.


>Yeah, and I was totally

Could be a dumb idea. However, the drug raises the body temperature,
like a fever does when the body wishes to counteract againt infection.
Now that is one *possible* reason why some people may report this effect. 
Can you provide any reason why it would *not* have a curing effect besides
an attitude of healthy cynicism?

Hey All,

Been doing some thinking (yeah, I know... ;)

I don't know how everyone on this list feels, but I definitely believe 
we're at a crossroads in our evolution.  

With our movement, we CAN facilitate change in others. The question is, 
how far do we take it.

First, we need to ask ourselves: 

Can we significantly affect the conciousness of others so as to bring about a 
fundamental change in human behavior?

I beleive the answer is yes.

Next:	Do we want to accept the responsibiltiy of our understanding and 
	be the facilitators of this change?

	I don't think we have a choice on this one.

Next: 	Do we take an active or passive stance in encouraging the 
	participation of others in our movement?

	A passive stance would mean we continue with the way we 
	celebrate. This implies that our parties are separate from the 
	manner in which "conventional" people spend their free time.

	Most people at our parties aren't conventional. We're all very 
	progressively minded people.

	Further, passivness implies that we realize that the world is 
	crumbling anyway, and we just enjoy ourselves while we can, 
	perhaps creating the tribal environment that we will live in 
	after societies crash.

	The question arises:	Should we even bother trying to change 
				and just let nature takes its course? Perhaps 
				humanity has had its chance in the natural 
				cycle, and it's time for another species to 
				dominate.	

	An active stance would imply that we find a method of encouraging 
	"conventional" people to attend our celebrations.

	(Fraser is already trying to do this. I'm not sure how effective 
	his methods will be).
	
	It seems to me that most "conventional" people are the ones who 
	are in positions to affect immediate change. These are the teachers, 
	local politians, community leaders, etc.

	With their particiaption at our celebrations, they can come to 
	the same understanding as ourselves. They can then go back to work with 
	these new insights and work to affect change in their respective 
	areas.   

Next:	How do we encourage participation?

	First, we have to lose the word RAVE. I'm sorry if any of you are 
	offended, but there are already so many  stigmas and negative 
	connotations with the word RAVE that, from my experience, it is the 
	primary deterrent to people's participation. I try to encourage others
	to come to these celebrations, but as soon as the word RAVE is seen or
	heard, they bolt. 

	We find some other name that is more "accpetable" (or less likely to 
	be perverted) by "conventional" people, then they won't be so mislead 
	as to the nature of our celebrations. Perhaps we focus more on 
	multicultural celebrations, pagan "holidays" or events, etc.
	
	We need more outdoor parties. The very fact we're outdoors is a 
	celebration in itself. I find outdoor parties to be much more powerful.
	This will help convey a more positive image of our celebrations to  
	"conventional" people.
	
	With the outdoor celebrations, we need to be responsible with our 
	behavior. Not delapitating the site, picking up trash, being 
	respectful to the people who stumble across our celebrations 
	accidentally, or those that might live in the vicinity. We've already
	started this. We need to be diligent and encourage it to continue.

With regard to the above, we can do two things:

	1).	Have our own private, intimate celebrations to renew our 
		energy and encourage ourselves to continue our 
		responsibilities.

	2).	Have integrated celebrations with both the "conventional" 
		and "non-conventional" people to help conciously affect the 
		ones who can help to affect immediate change in our world.
	
Some points to consider:

-	How do we prevent any exploitation if we begin "integrated" 
	celebrations. There's no doubt that some will see our movement as 
	an opportunity to satisfy their greed.

-	How do we prevent or resist persecution of our movement by "Authority"
	much like the tribes of our past.

If we want to affect change and we stay underground, it will take a long 
time-perhaps too long.

If we slowly go "above", we need to insure others don't pervert our 
intentions and destroy our movement.  

That's all for now.

-Jonas

>who were those folks who showed up wearing big masks and were blowing

just thought i'd reply to this. I read sfraves, but don't have much time to
post, but "those folks" were me and my housemates, peter and lissie. we like to make
masks for Halloween and work for weeks before every year. I love Sunset so much
and everything the Pacific Crew does for us, that I like to bring some energy to
that party. I've always had a vision of our frogs coming over the hills at the
Berkeley Marina and finally that vision was realized with just a little pleading
to my housemates to bring their masks along. It was great to do it, and
gratifying to see all these people waving goodbye when we left. I LOVE THIS
SCENE! The cops sure got a kick out us when we left around 7, kind of milling
around and smiling and poking each other. I'll never forget that. 

We want to do more, make more masks and set up cool wind toys and maybe get
together a drumming contingent. Anyone out there interested in gathering for
mask making and other creative events? I'm leaving my job in June and will have
a lot of time on my hands. My housemates are moving to a big warehouse in
Oakland, so we've got a space to work. Let me know - chocMalt@aol.com - or wait
we'll post to this list when we announce that we're ready to do it.

The "digeridon't" is just that - a  cardboard tube that my roommate plays very
well, and that I'm learning to play, as a digeridoo. we also throat sing
together and have been interested in doing an ambient room gig together as a
live performance. Can anyone offer us about a half-hour in their ambient set to
show everyone what we do? It's quite ethereal, trippy and beautiful and we'd
like to make it participatory, too. We just need some time and contacts. Thanks!

Unless you're an addict or potential addict, in which case you simply would
not have any discipline where getting loaded is concerned, and you would
keep upping the dose and taking cheaper drugs, having less fun and more
problems...  Nearly everyone I ever used drugs (including alcohol) with did
this. Addicts often try, with little sucsess, to control/discipline their
using and will swear that they can control it. That's just the nature of
the beast.

Psychological addiction is the only addiction that matters. Physical
addiction, after a period of withdrawal, generaly painful and awful, goes
away. It is Psychological addiction that remains a lurking deamon, even in
recovery, for the rest of an addicts life. You're right E is no different
than any other drug in this respect. Anything that gets you loaded, no
matter how nontoxic, has the potential to be very destructive. Therefore it
is impossible for E to be as safe as Tylonol, as someone said in another
post.

(Although it apears that what I've said here is in response to what Brian
said, a lot of it is not. Much is in response to bits and pieces of many
other posts)

Here's my little story from the weekend.

I attempted to go to the New Moon party in Pt. Reyes where I was supposed 
to DJ. I went with a couple of friends from Bolinas and we weren't able 
to find the party. We called the voice mail & it said that the sound system 
hadn't shown up yet. We decided to go back to Bolinas to sleep. Around 
6:30 am a friend called and asked us to come up to the party to help 
bring healing energy to a person suffering an acid freak out. Someone 
came and picked us up and took us to the party. We arrived around 8am and 
things were mellow and our ill friend was sleeping. It was a totally 
amazing morning. Charlotte was playing some trip hop / acid jazz and 
there were still 20 or thirty people. I was really glad that I finally 
made it to the party and saw my close friends (Morgan,Mona,Greg,Ann et 
al) who had been through an intense experience and showed what it means 
to be real friends in community seeking healing. I played the last set 
which ended around 10:30 or so. It was great fun , there were still a 
group of people dancing. After this we did a closing ritual with everyone 
who was still there. It was very nice!

I arrived at Sunset on Sun around 2:30 at the same time as Matt and his 
masked friends. It was a beautiful day and I saw alot of people I know. I 
thought Cyril played a nice set. It was different and more trancey. There 
were alot of people there by 4pm and I was hoping that the cops wouldn't 
show. At 5:30pm I walked out to the parking area to see if things were 
cool. There were three cop cars and three cops and Galen was talking to 
them. I walked up and started talking to them also. They were pretty 
mellow but one of them was older and less cool. He was intent on shutting 
the party down. His main excuse was that there were cars parked illegally 
and that the party was unpermitted and could be potentially unsafe. Galen 
and I were trying to be cordial while also trying to hint at the 
possibilty of letting the party continue. The uptight cop  made some 
calls back to the station and then told us that we'd have to turn the 
soundsystem off and leave. Me , Galen and the cops walked out to the park 
and the soundsystem was briefly turned off. As we were walking out I 
talked with the uptight cop and Galen talked with the more mellow younger 
ones. The uptight one was relatively cool and was asking me questions 
about what was going on. I was very nice to him and explained. He said he 
hadn't seen anything like this since the 60's. I told him to get used to 
it cuz it wasn't stopping anytime soon. As we approached the party you could 
tell that the cops were feeling the positive peacful vibration. Everyone 
was smiling and offered them candy. After some more smooth talkiing by 
Galen the uptight cop said "Well, everything looks okay here. We'll just 
check things out and leave you in peace." That's the best thing I've 
heard from a cop. We had actually had a real communication and they even 
stayed for awhile and _enjoyed_ themselves.

All in all it was a beautiful day and great party. I thought the music 
could have been a bit more diverse and more people could have picked up 
there own trash, though by the time I left the place looked pretty clean.
This was a good start to a new season but we have alot of work to do to 
raise our consciousness and overcome the ills of ignorance and addiction 
to destructive habits (be it speed, x, or habitual disregard for others 
and our surroundings). Hope we can continue to experiment with new forms 
of celebration which can invoke healing and positivity.

Yours in Transformation,
ronan

I didn't get to hear the KCBS report and don't wish to share my personal
feelings regarding the E thread that has been flogged beyond the pain
threshold on this list (oops! IMNSHO) but I do know from many  long trips to
Palo Alto from Oakland and back that KCBS regularly hands out it's e-mail
address on the air.  

Sending those wind jockeys a mail or two (or 30 or 40) might be a good way to
let them know that this is a topic they shouldn't report on without getiing
ALL the facts.

If memory serves, the e-mail address for KCBS radio is:

hallo all.

I am making the big trek down for the uziq/stc show on the 22nd.
While I am down in san fran, there are a few things I would like to
do:

1. Meet copious numbers of sfravers
2. Shop for copious quantities of great records
3. Find a good cheap used set of 1200's, or at least a cheap new one
4. Find a good cheap used mixer
5. Have a rEal good time at the show ;)

If anybody can help me with these, or point me towards a good
hostel or two (for me and fiver friends) I would be eternally
grateful.

Thank you.

i just read jonas' post, and i really dug it.  i think we all understand 
the desire to change consciousness through "rave" (i like the idea of 
calling it holiday instead), but we're not entirely sure or consolidated 
on how to go about doing it.  many an ear has heard me talk about the 
hundredth monkey concept, and it is a concept by which i firmly stand.  
i *highly* recomend that everybody on this list (and a whole mess of 
people not an the list) read the book the hundredth monkey, by ken keyes 
jr.  it's rather short with nifty drawings, and its very, very well 
writen and fun to read.  at least just read the first chapter.   rocks 
my world...

fellow travellers,

i'm new to the rave world, new to the experience of X, and new to this list.
the new moon last week X'ed virginity and left something expansive and
wonderful in its place. then on sunday, i went to the point isabel gathering,
danced with all the spirit i had, smiled at strangers, felt the sun and music
wash through me, swam through the wet  music with gyrating hips, webbed toes
and a sober but ecstatic mind. 

i write you collectively to share with you the perspective of this beginner's
mind. what i've recently found at the new moon, at the park, and at
sfraves@hyperreal.com is community and consciousness - two of the most
important things in my life. what i seek is a marraige of  community and
consciousness. there's clearer way to say this:  wholesome, functioning
community creates and supports increased consciousness and increased
consciousness in turn nourishes and adds life to the community.  some people
speak of an enduring tribe that will survive the ravishes of consumerism,
militarism, the contract with america, & etc. we're talking about the same
thing, using different images.  

i'm aware that i'm writing of ideals, abstractions. what is important and
real is the energy and enthusiasm we bring to the events. whether we call
them "raves," "happenings," "be-ins," or "joints," they are created entirely
by the people who attend them. we create the feeling, the tone, the mood. we
have the power to create experiences in ways that they meet our deepest
needs. no, we are that creative power. 

an earlier posting spoke about trying to bring the "common people" into the
rave-fold, to educate them about the spirit of our gatherings, and so, change
the world. i agree that we should welcome any people interested in our
sub-culture, that we should welcome them as new friends as i was welcomed -
but i think that our emphasis ought to remain on developing our consciousness
and our community. if we are successful in this respect, if we treat
ourselves and each other with love and respect, if we develop our minds while
opening our hearts and freely expressing our creativity (through music,
dance, writing, poetry, painting, sculpture - through simple intimacy,
honesty, and compassion), we won't be able to keep the interested people away
from our gatherings. 

we live in a culture of radical separation and disaffection. my hunch is that
nearly everyone from california to new york craves a supportive community of
fun-loving people and the consciousness to know how to best interact with
those people - but they don't know how to find it. so instead, they stop
listening to voice of their inner needs and instead they watch homer simpson
slap his forehead and say "doOOH!" for the upteenth time.   

we're a sad group of people, we americans. we have every luxury of the world
at our disposal and yet so many of us are in the depths of our selves lonely,
isolated, and anxious about our lives. we've convinced ourselves that we're
unable to follow our dreams, so we grab for whatever sensual pleasures there
are on the shelf. 

for me, X is not just another sensual pleasure. it is a powerful tool with
which to explore the mystery of my own mind, and to connect with like minds. 

disclaimer: i'm not speaking for anyone other than myself. these are my
observations, not universal truths. and they are the observations of a
newcomer.

why am i writing this? to give thanks to the community, to share my vision of
what we could be with you, and to stick my neck out and emphasize the
transfomational and  artistic aspect of the experience over and above the
escapist or purely recreational aspect. in other words, let's heal, nourish
and develop ourselves first and foremost, both as individuals and as a
community. and goddamn: let's enjoy it every step of the way...

Hello fellow ravers!

I had the doubtful pleasure of attending community yesterday at 1015 
Folsom after having been told to expect techno music there. They did not 
play one single techno record, only house. Is there any place at all in 
SF where they play real techno? It seems to me house rules here?

Please tell me where one can get to hear real techno music without having 
to test all the clubs myself, that is too expensive and I have not energy 
enough to run from on place to another all evening.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Best regards
Jan aka Carlos

well, there IS techno in sf, but sometimes it's pretty hard to find...

you might want to check out AMP at 201 9th at howard on fridays (9-2:00, $5).
i think it's a pretty queer male cruisy space, but don't quote me on 
this.  also, the flyer says "tribal acid and trip house" so i'm not 
POSITIVE it's techno, but susan has usually been on the harder side.

also, DEFINITELY check out ethan and alex whenever they're spinning 
(usually one-off parties, and friends and family).  oh, and chizura - she 
plays rad, hard techno, but doesn't seem to have many gigs.  and 
sometimes bryce (he MOSTLY plays techno at large parties, but not 
necessarily all the time.)

but if it's BREAKBEAT techno you're after, then i have no clue where to 
look, as i try to avoid that as much as possible.

good luck,
monicat the tekno slut

well, despite the fact that i absolutely despise the new sf weekly, i 
have to recommend this week's issue for the article on hip hop.  there's 
a lot of info. about police pressure on clubs to keep them from having 
hip hop shows, and it's definitely relevant to ravers (and our new year's 
eve buddy capt. yalon is interviewed!  my hero!  he kept me from hurting 
myself having too much fun!)

Subject: Raves

Hi,
I'm a reporter at the Marin IJ, working on a story about raves and esctasy,
truth vs. myth. I've read some pretty erronous information in the media and
want to hear from people who actually go to these parties. If you feel like
letting me know what raves are like, please respond to the above address.
I'm particularly interested in hearing from people who live in Marin county
or have attended raves in the county. I will not print your name, but I
need to know your age and what town or school you attend. Thanks
regards,
Zenaida A. Gonzalez

Dear Sfravers;

	With all due respects to Brian at Hyperreal, and Wired magaizne
and the responsible, honest press. Don't trust just any reporter, unless
you get what their going to say in writing, they will say and do anything
for a story, and as far as being on our side they have no good reason to
support us, they have very good reasons for making sensational hype about
the negative aspects of raves.  Because that sells papers, not how
wonderful and beautiful our scene is.  Just me two cents, BUT I FEEL THEY
ARE NOT ON OUR SIDE, AS WE HAVE SEEN ALL TO WELL IN THE PAST!!!!!!!! 

	Also, don't believe them when they say they won't print your 
name, friends of mine have been told that one, and not only did they 
print their names, but misquoted them, and I'm being kind when I say 
misquoted. 

	We don't need the main stream press, WE HAVE THE INTERNET, the 
main stream press needs us, If you talk to them, get everything in writing.

		PERSONAL DISCLAIMER!!!!!@!

	Note my opinions EXPRESSED in this post do not represent the views
or opinions of Hyperreal, and I'm not assoicated with Hyperreal or Wired
magaize, These opinions are mine alone, Thanks

Sincerely
Brian Darkness

Don't mistake my forwarding that post with any sort of endorsement of it 
at all.  I've had my experiences with the press and raves, most of which 
are documented somewhere in the sfraves archives.  Look for the bit on 
"48 hours" doing a story on LSD use and raves.

I came up with a different application of the 100th Monkey some time back 
which you all might find relevant as it helps to explain what otherwise 
looks unexplainable.

consider that one's inner psychological makeup is built on the 100th 
Monkey Principle.  thus, the first time we see something that brings up 
in us the natural reaction:  "Jeeesuz, that has no place on this here 
planet, I GOTTA DO SOMETHING!" that's Monkey One.  The feeling passes, so 
does time.  then something else pops up and it's Monkey Two.  etc. only 
when you reach Monkey 100 does a sudden change come about in your 
behavior.    so, now, when it looks like people never seem to change, 
that, despite all the terrible things going on, people just never seem to 
GET IT - don't worry nor get depressed too much.  it could be that 
practically the entire popultion is on Monkey 99

I've been thinking about this for a long time (and am still discussing
aspects of it with the Captn, especially since he can now see how it works in
.au land)...

I keep coming back to Kurt Cobain, and whether $200 grunge shirts at Macy's
affected his state of mind...

The flaw in the above reasoning is assuming that you can keep the same
character of Vibe after opening up the participation to the larger public. 
This has failed everywhere else - for example, most of us have experienced
reading a newsgroup or mailing list that was great until it became popular. 
Or how about just within raves themselves?  How many times have I read "at
Blah event, don't even arrive until 4 am when the club types have left"?  My
impression is that many local raves have map points mostly to exclude the
sort of people we're contemplating including!

SO, it is not sufficient just to create a marketing scheme for popularizing
rave culture.

It is crucial to come up with some way of doing this WITHOUT losing the Vibe
and just ending up with the format.

Otherwise,  Our Destiny is  the Michael Jackson/Tony Bennett House Party
Album....

to everyone on sfraves...
I just wanted to share something with you all real quick.  I am flying 
down to Austin, Texas this morning to meet with someone whose name is  
familiar to this list.  I'm going to meet solarvibe (Jon Tea) for the 
first time in my life.  He struck a chord in my soul exactly 5 months ago 
with a post to the  list and we've been writing ever since.  It was 
truely unexpected, and thanks to this list, I have found a friend and 
soulmate for life and I just wanted to say  THANKS!! 
I want all the juicy details of Vision - I've gone the last 2 years, but 
will miss it this year (I'll be going to NATION in Austin instead! :)

So until Wednesday when I get back,
Have a great weekend......
luv,
Amy

Two tabs of E could kill you if you swallowed them both at the same time
and choked.  Other than that, its going to be the Amount that you are
taking that will cause the damage, and amount is not in anyway
solidly linked with the word "pill."  I have seen pills that have 100 mg
and others that had around 250 mg.

Insuflation/snorting drugs tends to makes their effects more powerful
for a shorter duration of time.  This would simply mean that the
lower dosage is going to hit you harder, and the side effects will too.

This seems like a more sure way to end up in trouble if you dont
pay attention to what you are doing.

But then again.  Snorting even 100 mg of something is such a pain in the
ass to do, i guess you could rely on the "people will just give up" theory.

Just to be really anal.  It's Grob.  Charles Grob, he's the only
one doing legal MDMA research on people, (well him and his assistants)
and he is doing it out of UCLA/Harbor Medical Center, just FYI.

hey, all.  i've been missing the Bay area lately, but this list has
been helping me feel in touch.  boy, all the great parties i've been
missing...  you all have something very special, and i hope you
appreciate it enough.  i sure thought i did, but i find myself wishing
i had made more of an effort when i was there.

the startup company i work for has recently released two interesting
WWW products.  MultiHost (http://www.nfic.com/multihost.html) is a
httpd server which allows for a single physical machine to return
different pages and behave differently for http://foo.bar.com and
http://yow.zap.com.  PageAlert (http://www.nfic.com/pagealert.html) is
a service which lets you know when your web pages are inaccessible or
have changed for any reason.  make sure to sign up for a free trial
account --- most of the functionality is not apparent until you add
some pages and run it for a bit.

just thought a) some of you might like to know what i've been up to
and b) there seems to be a bit of WWW talk on this list.  apologies if
not interested...

i barely managed to keep myself from jumping in during the anti-frat
discussion which seems to flare up every once in a while on this list.
keep in mind that fraternities *are* different, especially region to
region and school to school.  fraternity experiences therefore can be
very different as well.  people who follow this list know that i feel
i wouldn't have survived school without my house.  'nuff said.

i miss you guys!

So what happened this week?  Well it was quite hectic.  For a start some 
body died from taking X or, more to the point, died from some thing that 
was brought on by the X like epolepcy.  ANGRY OLD MAN SAYS: Anybody that 
dies from X has some thing already that is dangerious and, therefore, they 
should not be doing X.  X is a serious drug and people should be more 
responsible.  In other word's, anybody who is stupid enough not to find 
the full facts of a drug that one is taking (including facts about it's 
source and medical danger's) deserves everything they get.
Then there was Whicked last Saturday.  A good party; the tv's in the 
chill-out room were inspired and the dj's in that room were also 
excellent.  To bad that it was sweat box and that all the bouncer's their 
are wanker's.  ANGRY OLD MAN SAYS: Get another venue now because if you 
don't everyone is going to stop going to your parties because they are 
fed-up with the venue.
Then there was Sunset (Sunset, NOT Pacific).  While not in quite a nice a 
venue as Berkeley Marina it was never-the-less a beautiful spot, with 
beautiful weather, with BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.  Sunset is with out a doubt the 
best party in the bay area with a totally mixed crowd and no 
cops/bouncer's telling you what to do; and it's free!  ANGRY OLD MAN 
SAYS:  Fuck nightclubs (except maybe 1015) lets get back to nature and 
freedom.
Then there was Community on Wednesday.  I did not go but Comunity it is the 
best party at a night club in SF partly because Christophe (one of the 
very best dj's around) play's their.  (check out his tape called The 
Pressure; a masterpiece of mixing).  This is also because it is at 1015 
Fulsome which is the best nightclub in SF.  ANGRY OLD MAN SAYS: In 
the Summer, nightclub parties once a month and outdoor parties once or 
twice a week
And, on the whole, Angry Old Man feels that their is a good vibe around 
at the moment; Summer is here.  He was saddended by some of the recent 
ignorant comments on SF raves especially to with Xenophobia and F&F 
particually those by some one called Tristan and phred and Brian 
Darkness; but other's said some silly thing's too.  ANGRY OLD MAN SAYS: 
Despite local belief, anger is not a negative vibe and at least Tristan 
was causing people to think about what they were saying so that they 
really thought about it and then were in a position to lend a worthwhile 
voice in the debate.  Remember: it is only when some body pisses you off 
or is obnoxious that you start to really think about what you are saying 
because all Humans feel insecure so they do not want to be seen as 
arseholes.  Tristan succeeded in doing this and therefore he should not be 
thought to badly of.

I was going to have a new music spot as well but I think that I'll leave 
this up the readers.  Also every week their we be a big shout.  This week 
a big shout goes out to all at Sunset, the possie from Bolder Colerado, 
Whicked on Tour, and, as always, to Frazer Clark and all at the 
parrallel university.
Until next week, this is Angry Old Man telling you to stop being angry.

because of the high volume of responces to this topic, i've been keeping my 
opinions to myself.  i really have to mention, though, that we ought not 
forget that snorting anything other than clean air will wreck your sinuses. 
as anyone who's ever snorted e can attest, it hurts like the devil's up 
your nose, more than meth or any of that stuff.  and it hurts because it's 
destroying membrane.  that's not to say that i am totally opposed to 
snorting e or any other drug (that's another topic entirely).  just 
remember, if you do snort anything, snort a bit of water up after taking a 
line.  it clears any powder out that my be lodged within the membrain. 
otherwise it can rot (yes, ROT! bleech!) after being left up there for too 
long.

and always eat your vegatables...

Greetings from all of us at Friends and Family :)

As you may have noticed, our last party got busted. Rather than letting the
party end on what might be an angry, sad, or ambiguous note, we wanted to
take this opportunity to tell you a little bit ourselves, why we're doing
what we're doing, what happened that night and, last but not least, what
our plans for the future are and how you might fit into those plans.

First off our sincerest thanks for coming to the party and bringing with
you the positive energy, love and respect that make these celebrations what
they are. It remains a truly amazing experience for us to join with you in
helping to facilitate the release of this energy. May it continue to spread
with all of our help, love, and support.

Friends & Family, well beyond being just a party, is a group of people
committed to facilitating ultra-low cost, not-for-profit, all ages,
community celebrations that feature and encourage the amazing diversity of
talent and energy that we have here in the bay area. We open ourselves to
anyone and everyone that cares to join us in these endeavors. If you'd like
to be involved, please contact us. You can look for the smiley faces on
laminates or T-shirts when you're out dancing or email us at the address
provided below.

At our last party we had a few problems. Most noteable among these was
rather severe overcrowding. We wish to state emphatically that this was not
our intention and we did not oversell what we took to be the capacity of
the space. However a variety of circumstances, some within and some beyond
our control -- forged tickets and duplicated maps for instance -- resulted
in hundreds more people than we expected finding out where the party was
and attempting to get in, creating a massive problem at the door and
inside. We did our best to deal appropriately with the situation which,
unfortunately, resulted in very long waits at the door.

Ultimately an alram was triggered on the building next door, the police
responded to it, noticed we were having a party and shut us down. We
greatly appreciate your peaceful, happy cooperation in helping us safely
clear the building at that time and offer our sincerest apologies that our
evening together ended so abruptly. Thank you for the many comments and
criticisms you've given us, we will strive to incorporate them into future
events.

In regards to the police, we would also like to emphasize what we take to
be the real importance of immediate, peaceful cooperation with the police
when we do encounter them. The police generally do what they want when they
set their minds to it and we have learned over and over again that, whether
they are right or wrong, getting in their way does absolutely no good.

Unfortunately we learned this lesson yet again at this party. Two of our
members had a less than pleasant confrontation with the police at the door,
one of them was arrested and faces two criminal misdemanor charges while a
third member of our group was ultimatley issued five criminal misdemeanor
citations for throwing the party in general. If you witnessed any of
these events, or if you have any useful information that bears on these
events, please contact us, court dates for these "offenses" are pending.

As you may or may not also know, Friends and Family parties are always
benefits; all of our members including DJs, visual artists, staff, etc. all
work strictly for free; no one has ever been paid for being part of a
Friends & Family.

So we wish also to thank you for donating so generously at the recent
party. Your contributions will benefit Komotion, an arts collective that
has been supporting independent and underground music in the Bay Area for
almost ten years, entirely through volunteer efforts, and will also help
defray the costs, legal and otherwise, resulting from the busting of the
Other New Year's Eve Bash at 938 Harrison Street this year. Some of your
contributions will also help defray some of our legal costs. We sincerely
appreciate your willingness to support the underground and hope you feel
your contribution was well placed. We will be back :)

Finally, and most importantly, we want you to know that we take your
safety and comfort very seriously. We would never, will never,
intentionally place anyone at risk. We hope also that you will view our
parties as your parties, and treat the people you meet there and elsewhere
as friends, as family, lending a hand where needed, helping those in need
where needed. Together, we can do it.

Lots of love,
Friends & Family.

Mijos, we must act quickly! I received the following ransom/demand note,
wrapped around ERNIE'S SEVERED EAR (!) in my mailbox!It reads:

>A warning, ravers: we, the Whining Path (sendero depressoso), have kidnapped
>>ERNIE, the Orange Satan. We hold him hostage, and this severed ear is proof. 
>We wish him no further harm. But we will KILL him if our demands are not met:

> a) all sessame-st. references, as well as Dr.Seuss or other childhood

> b) give us a break! One more smiling little girl gives us a sticker or offers
>>gum, we will seek out and capture BIG BIRD. We will NOT show any mercy to the
>>Yellow Devil.
> c) Stop this hugging crap! How can we dance, or look cool in a 2 hour line if
>>you wave, smile, run up and hug us? Stay away!
> d) enuf with these cheap parties. Big venue$ are the way to go.

>If our demands are not met by the SF Scene, we will continue to victimize your

Um, this looks serious, folks, and they don't look like they're fooling
with us, Ernie's ear was found wrapped in the above note, with fresh
stuffing leaking from it[Bad scene, my neighbor wept for 2 hours]. They
claim Ernie is well, but tired and feeling abandoned. The E-Bee, who was
lost at New Years spent 2 weeks in captivity before rescue by the elite
forces of Cloud Factory. I was very relieved at the reunion, and can only
offer my sympathy and hope to Ernie's loved ones. BURT, hang in there,
buddy, Ernie's gonna make it, he's a lover, not a fighter.

Police forensics were incapable of finding clues. My phone line is
monitored, in case the terrorists return my calls. If you see the Sendero
Depressoso, please, do no attempt to animate them. They are EXTREMELY
UNHAPPY and will react with attitude.
 Report them to the authorities (your friends) and gradually try to make
them feel at ease. They are easily unarmed by acceptance, and if they break
into a smile, they have been vanquished and may defect and join the Rave
Corps. More details to follow.

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the "never again" E-Bee.....

I haven't seen anything posted about Come-unity on Wednesday, so I have 
to say something.... it was wonderful.  Great crowd, positive energy, 
smiles and hugs.  The music was 
definitely on the house side, but I think that just fits for come-unity. 
It was also less crowded than the last two I have been to... you could 
always find room to dance somewhere.
 Hi to everyone I met there, and for those of you who missed it, consider 
calling in sick next month.

keep smilin'

Given all the political discussion on the list lately, I thought some of 
you might be interested in knowing this:

The Women's Leadership Network, a new Internet-based national 
non-partisan group, has formed to educate and mobilize women and men to 
fight the Republican Contract with Americca and elect pro-women 
candidates in 1996. There are lots of opportunities to get involved locally.

Please email me privately if you'd like more info.

Andrew,
I very strongly agree.  I thought the music was great.  I had a difficult 
time getting off the dance floor for an occational rest.  I don't think I 
ever sweat so much at a rave before.  The vibe was great.  I thought it 
was better than last month.  I liked having a little more room to dance.  
I felt the energy was overall more connected, where last month I found 
alot of pockets of energy that were connected, although last month did 
have it's magical moments as well.  
Anybody know if sunset is happening.  Suppose to be a sunny day in the 
70's :)

April, 1995 Fellow Debtor: This is going to sound like a con, but in
fact IT WORKS!  The person whois now #8 on the list was #9 when I got
it, which was only a few daysago.  Five dollars is a small investment
in your future.  Forget the lottery for a week, and give this a try.
 It can work for ALL of us.You can edit this list with a word
processor or text editor and then convert it to a text file.
Good Luck!!
Dear Friend: My name is Dave Rhodes.  In September 1988 my car was
repossessed and the bill collectors were hounding me like you
wouldn't believe.  I was laidoff and my unemployment checks had run
out.  The only escape I had from the pressures of failure was my
computer and my modem.  I longed to turnmy advocation into my
vocation.In January 1989 my family and I went on a ten day cruise to
the tropics. I bought a brand new Lincoln Town Car with CASH in
February 1989.  I amcurrently building a new home on the west coast
of Florida, with aprivate pool, boat slip, an a beautiful view of the
bay from my breakfastroom table and patio.  I will never have to work
again.  Today I am RICH! I have earned over $400,000.00 (Four Hundred
Thousand Dollars) to dateand will become a millionaire within 4 or 5
months.  Anyone can do thesame.  This money making program w orks
perfectly every time, 100% of thetime.  I have NEVER failed to earn
$50,000.00 or more whenever I wanted. Best of all, you never have to
leave home except to go to your mailbox orpost office.In October
1988, I received a letter in the mail telli ng me how I couldearn
$50,000.00 or more whenever I wanted.  I was naturally veryskeptical
and threw the letter on the desk next to my computer.  It'sfunny
though, when you are desparate, backed into a corner, your minddoes
crazy things.  I spent a f rustrating day looking through the wantads
for a job with a future.  The pickings were sparse at best.
Thatnight I tried to unwind by booting up my computer and calling
severalbulletin boards.  I read several of the messages posted and
then glanceda t the letter laying next to the computer.  All at once
it became clearto me.  I now had the key tomy dreams.I realized that
with the power of the computer I could expand and enhancethis money
making formula into the most unbelievable cash flow genera torthat
has ever been created.  I substituted the computer bulletin boardsin
place of the post office and electronically did by computer
whatothers were doing by mail.  Now only a few letters are mailed
manually. Most of the hard work is speedily downloaded to other
bulletin boardsthroughout the world.  If you believe that someday you
deserve that luckybreak that you have waited for all of your life,
simply follow the easyinstructions below.  Your dreams WILL come
true.     Sincerely yours,
     Dave Rhodes

The following letter was written by a participating member in
thisprogram.******************
*********************************************************************
*****To those with the COMMON sense to participate in this easy
moneyopportunity:About six months ago I received the enclosed post in
letter form.  Iignored it.  I received about fi ve more of the same
letter within thenext two week.I ignored them also.  Of course, I was
tempted to followthrough and dreamed of making thousands, but I was
convinced it was justanother gimmick and could not possibly work.I
was wrong!  About three w eeks later I saw this same letter posted on
alocal bulletin board in Montreal.  I liked the idea of giving it a
trywith my computer.  I didn't expect much because I figured, if
otherpeople were as skeptical as I, they would not be too quick to
part w ith$5.00.  But, I BUY LOTTERY TICKETS WEEKLY IN MY PROVINCE
AND HAVE NOTHINGTO SHOW FOR IT BUT TICKET STUBS!  This week I decided
to look at this asmy weekly lottery purchase.  I addressed the
envelopes and mailed out$1.00 in each as directed.  Two w eeks went
by and I didn't receiveanything in the mail.  The fourth week rolled
around and I couldn'tbelieve what happened!  I can not say that I
received $50,000.00, but itwas definitely well over $35,000.00!  For
the first time in 10 years Igot out of debt.  It was great.  Of
course, it did not take me long to gothrough my earnings, so I am
using this excellent money makingopportunity once again.  FOLLOW THE
INSTRUCTIONS AND GET READY TO ENJOY!Please send a copy of this letter
along with the en
closed letter sotogether we can convince people who are skeptical
that this really doeswork!
Good Luck,
Charles Kust

Que.Hey...   I'm one of the people who downloaded this a while ago,
and I've madequitea profit...not 50,000 dollars, but TONS more than
the 5 bucks I sent in. It might take more than
 60 days to get 50,000, but I think I can wait.

The tribal sets played at Spundaes at the Carribean Zone are really good, 
in my opinion.  Personally, I don't like most house, so this is the kind 
of music I try to seek out.

OKAY! so this letter is GARGANTUAN! 

But with all the talk about everything on this list(rave integration etc.) 
this letter seems to express how I and  many of us feel.  And it is 
really worth reading...So please read it..

I met up with the local college radio station Dj that is working very 
hard on making a difference... I took an initiative to meet him...he sent 
me this letter he has found...somewhere on the net...Maybe you have read 
it maybe not but its a real confirmation ....So check it out! :)
                    T H E  I M A G I N A L  R A V E

This is not so much about what raves are or aren't, than 
about what they MIGHT be.

So don't bother looking here for a rehash of the obvious: that raves 
are the latest thing in underground dance parties/about having 
fun/feeling good/Peace/Energy/Unity ... all of which IS true, 
needless to say, but there remains so much more to be said, so much 
more to BE!

CUT through the clouds of trendism and commercialization that 
attach themselves to any major new mutation in culture. What wants 
to be invoked (what I want to invoke--what I hope YOU want to 
invoke) is that imaginal, incandescent core out of which all the 
smoke & noise is generated; what a rave truly can be, for some 
people in some situations--what it could BECOME; and then, peeling 
away at the sides, ... falling off one by one, duller, flatter, greyer ... 
and ever so much more TAME ... all those would-be and almost-raves, 
unavoidable byproducts of anything too real.

An old Sufi saying has it that: "where there's counterfeit, there's 
true gold."

So next time you go to something that calls itself a rave but isn't, 
don't just write it all off; the real ones do exist, and why SHOULD 
they be so easy to find? And, after all, it's up to YOU to make them 
real.

Allright, we already know that raves are THE space-age tribal youth 
ritual, the return of the dionysian energy that first emerged in 50's 
rock 'n' roll and erupted in full force in the late 60's with the 
intertwining of music and psychedelic drugs. But the rave-current is 
itself only the more visible crest of something broader and 
deeper.It's no coincidence that it hits the States at the same time as 
a major resurgence of psychedelic usage.

You can take the toying with neo'60's motifs--day-glo, flowers, 
smiley faces, flares--as mere fashion recycling by a generation born 
largely post-Summer of Love. Or you can see these themes as the 
instinctual recovery of a project left hanging, next breath after a 
two decade-long lull. Or you can go ever furthur--and why not!?--and 
see "the 60's" as only one recent intrusion within the Flatland of 
(take a deep breath now) Gravity-Bound-Domesticated-Humanoid-
Industrial Civilization (got that?) of a future that is already 
happening, a future that beckons us towards itself and sends its 
echoes spiralling back through the dark and narrow tunnels of 
terrestrial time to make itself come true...

But only with your help, of course!

Picture a wave forming on the horizon, a big one (talking late 50's, 
early 60's): the psychick surfers coasting out there, beatniks, non-
conformists, oddball academics bored with the small town life at 
the shore and all its dismal soap-opera games, looking for something 
to carry them away into a wilder, richer world; the first swells of 
energy carry with them a tide of psycho-active algaes...

HOFFMAN/HUXLEY/BURROUGHS/GINSBURG/WATTS/LEARY/ALPERT/KE
SEY & CO., issue their first reports and manifestoes; munching on the 
junk food of the gods, our proto-mutants are initiated into the 
mysteries of the Vortex; they come back to the cardboard facades of 
Main Street with their evocations of kaleidoscopic infinity, eyes lit 
with the light of alien suns. Their news answers a gnawing hunger 
among so many trapped within the greypastelboxroutines of the 
industrial-consumer-democratic hive; More, they activate dormant 
circuits of the hive's nervous system, and spawn a burst of deviance: 
forms of rebellion less interested in disputing what varieties of 
greypastelboxroutines are preferable and what's right and wrong for 
everybody, than in setting up scouting parties for heading out to 
sea...

Underline the word parties.

Dosed to the gills, beatniks in existential black mutate into 
rainbow-hued hippiedom. Up with the Flower Children, hedonistic and 
'escapist'--so called because they withdrew from the arena of 
domesticated primate aggro-sports known as 'politics' in favor of 
actually learning about the infinite kingdoms within their own body 
and nervous system. Drop into the Haight, turn off powertrips, tune 
out conformism and competition. 

Meltdown ensues. All the accelerated bondings through Be-Ins, Love-
Ins, communes. Awash in the incense of oriental exoticism and 
occultist bric-a-brac, a renaissance of the spirit decks itself out in 
raiments of psychic kitsch. And how much can we fault them, really, 
if their Love&Peace trip undercut itself by becoming a denial of the 
Darkness; after all, they are there for us to learn from.

But just as everyone is tumbling about in the cosmic froth, 
anticipating revolution or millenium tomorrow afternoon at the 
latest, the Wave suddenly evaporates beneath them. No, the Earth Egg 
didn't quite hatch yet, ...just some initial stirrings. And so the 
children of the Vortex find themselves hurtling through the air like 
Wil E. Coyote, wrapped up in all their newfound lifestyles, but the 
vital juice is gone, and it all becomes so tame and lame so quickly, 
and in any case, a lot of people couldn't handle the intensity so it 
comes time to settle back into a safe routine, in some cases lay the 
ground for those who come after; & all around are the Mr. Jones' of 
many guises, panicked at the imminent collapse of Normalville; some 
however take their chance to cash in on what they can of it, a lot of 
others are wholly freaked, and thus begins a Counter-Reformation. 
One the one hand, a retreat from direct encounter with the Abyss 
crystallizes into the New Age, and on the other, it's back to the 
Bible, dumb drugs, white-bread, and Family Values. And all the 
hipsters left posing without a clue, all the 
burnouts/fuckups/addicts & victims of some invisible multi-
dimensional boogeying elephant; over there in the ivy towers, the 
blind men scribble their learned tomes, dissecting some stray 
paisley footprints; but something far stranger has happened, and its 
awfully hard to make out just what till the next, bigger cousin of 
that wave starts to surface offshore.

Meanwhile even many devotees of the Vortex ascribe it to the 
decline in quality of their psychoactive goodies, mistaking the 
portal for the vista beyond (but how do you enter the vista without 
the portal? hmmm...BE THY VISION! a distant curl of the Vortex 
whispers back).

Credit it all to upsurges of the Gaian mind, long-schemed scams of 
the giggling DNA-consciousness, or the flotsam & jetsam cast down 
by That Transcendental Novelty Item at the End of Time; choose your 
metapors--the more the merrier; but there's a mystery-in-process 
that all the nice rationalistic analyses will never get at: here I'll 
echo a point once made by Mr. Leary: the most subtle form of 
conservatism is that which views the present only through the prism 
of the past!

And yes, (to those for whom it's not patently obvious), IT'S 
HAPPENING AGAIN.

***

At the heart of the rave is a modern, technologically clad 
form of non-verbal, ecstatic communion. The ethos of 
openness, sharing, intimacy, touch and empathy--not to mention the 
pure intensities of trance itself--facilitated by the use of LSD & 
MDMA (hey, the fact that you have to take these things to loosen up 
is a sign of just how far down & lost we all are!!), in tandem with 
the all-night long pulsation of bodies to the same sound source, can 
and does create a context where layers of armoring and conditioning 
are shed, where those willing can find the joyful and mysterious 
realm of their bodies free of oh-so many enculturated ego-trips and 
bullshit, ... while also opening the "post-terrestrial" circuits of their 
psyches. (Whew! Pause, return to beginning of paragraph, read again 
slowly.)

In other words, a safe space where we can be as weird as we want 
to be.

A collective molting ritual for the new species.

***

Or take it from another angle: compare the rave-thing to a chemical 
reaction: a half-dozen ingredients (make your own list), inert & 
ordinary in the normal course of things; but combine them in right 
proportions, at the right time and place, apply the CATALYST (& 
what what THAT be?) and BOOM!, you've set off an explosion, a chain 
reaction producing ENERGY, LOTS OF IT, and in that process a 
dynamic that continues to transform many of the starting 
ingredients into new & unknown qualities. No question, of course, 
that bystanders can look in from the skeptically, and reduce it all 
back to something familiar: escapism, consumerism, fashion parade, 
whatever. But we'll leave them to their nervous calculations...
 

***

OK, so you want a schoolbook definition of TECHNO-SHAMANISM, that 
catchphrase everybody likes to invoke but no one seems to be able to 
actually explain?
Prepare to jump levels: As the individual shaman/ess evicts demons 
and excises magical darts from the sick person through a mixture of 
magickal sound & motion, so on the level of the diseased and crisis-
ridden 'global village' raves aim to heal the collective body by 
shaking it loose of its neurotic fixations and death-fetishes. 

EXORCISM THROUGH DANCE.

Unhooking the talons and shadowy webs of control. A physical 
unlearning of a few thousand years worth of BAD HABITS.

Learning to be at once a little more human and a little more alien.

Healer, leader, visionary, outcast: the shaman/ess' role is multi-
faceted, both at the center but also relegated to the margins of the 
community; the use of sound and/or psychoactive compounds are 
central to shamanism. The shaman/ess chants, hums, drums and 
dances as a way of programming hir voyage into the "spirit realms" 
(aka hyperspace), as well as of healing the mind and body of others, 
... all on a more face-to-face, way lo-tech scale, of course.

So there, chew on that for a while.

***

It's a pretty sad but predictable fact that self-professed "radicals" 
have been oblivious to this phenomenon, just because it seems to 
emanate out of NITEKLUBLAND; too bad--when will they figure out 
that all social alienation is ultimately grounded in an alienation 
from the body--that realm of nature closest to us but oh-so far 
away. Their heroine Emma Goldman once proclaimed to the grim 
socialist militants of her day: "If I can't dance in your revolution I 
want no part of it."

And what if dance could be a modality of social change?

A heretical thought, no doubt. "Free your ass and your mind will 
follow," so said George Clinton. But hey, he was just another crass 
capitalistic rock star, right?

Not to rescusitate, however, that burdensome word, Revolution. 
Scratch the R, hilite the E. Quote an obscure graffito from a wall in 
Paris, May 1968: "This is not a Revolution but a Mutation." And say 
rather, TAZ. Temporary Autonomous Zone.

Like the TAZ, the rave is wild, nomadic, outside the maps of Power. 
At its best, the rave opens onto a realm of free-form behavior and 
perception, one in which there is no hierarchy, no leaders or 
followers, at most the dj and the light-show artists. (Hopefully 
benign--be careful who you leave your sensorium with!)

...Not unlike the Situationist International's notion of the "situation" 
(sorry, I just had to drag them in here!), a space of liberated 
interactions... but where the participants are the art and the show, 
the synergy between them all the event (or event horizon?). If the 
insurrection was supposed to realize itself in a festival, we might 
ask, why shouldn't the festival turn into an insurrection--an 
insurrection of Love?

Anyone who has been part of a REAL rave, if only once, briefly, 
knows that its insane, insanely beautiful ferocity is something that 
exceeds all the contrived parlour-games that pass for alternatives, 
social or political. The mere fact of this ferocious hedonism is, 
without words or slogans, A REFUTATION OF DOMESTICATED 
EXISTENCE.

So FUCK IT if most of this California rave-scene is still ensnared in 
niteklubbism. Invade the pseudo-raves, instigate roving micro-raves. 
Doesn't take more than a ghetto blaster and a handful of courageous 
revellers to start a rave on any streetcorner or park, see how long it 
takes to catch..., or to be shut down...

THIS is OUR form of protest--our style of dance is angry and 
combative as well as loving and celebratory; to free our bodies first 
from the rotting carcass of history,,,

...and from there, ... who knows where we'll go?

***

Prediction: a few years down the road, the rave-scene will be looked 
back on as the primary networking mechanism for the tribes of star-
farers. 

But if ravers can't clean up after themselves, how are they going to 
clean up the planet?

***

DANCE

If you had to have JUST ONE metaphor for it all to live by and 
through, wouldn't that just be it. The spiral dance of life...so it 
sounds cliched, but cliched only in words, in words...

DANCE

but (& rave-friends can detour here for a sec, these are words for 
those who've never raved and long stopped going out to 

DANCE

DANCE, --this kind of dance--is FREEING MOTION. Not just moving 
to the beat but letting the beat help you throw off all the 
constricted robotic movements that have been imprinted into your 
heart, your eyes, your ears, your arms, your ass, your dreams, by all 
the tricks, traumas & seductions of society; and find the REAL YOU; 
dancing with the world, but dancing off the consensus-trance, that 
narrow greyout rightangle robotic updown freezeframe pseudo-
reality.

Raves signal the return to Western culture of sacred dance. A dance 
that balances discipline with excess, ecstasy with focus. Look at the 
three great Monotheisms that have pretty much defined our psycho-
somatic matrix: Judaism, Christianity, Islam: none of them possess 
any tradition of Sacred movement; they have all been scared shitless 
of the Body, and have instituted its repression in a thousand and one 
subtle ways. How appropriate that the advent of a spiritualized form 
of movement to the center of Civilization should present itself in a 
totally decadent, seemingly profane form. And people wonder why 
raves are actively suppressed back in the UK? Raves represent the 
primal life-force suppressed so long ago it remains only a dim but 
real memory.

And let's get this out of the way too: dancing on a decent dose of a 
psychedelic is something else again: communing with the animal 
spirits encoded into the depths of your skin, letting them out of 
their millenial cages. Learning how you can be each of them when 
you need to be; and its also about learning how to fly, how to turn 
yourself inside out into a spinning glowing disc, though that's a 
little harder ... and then, once we've got that under our belts, we can 
do it TOGETHER.

It's been said before, but not clearly enough: UFOS R US.

***

So what if all this prepacked ravitis costs too much. Don't leave it 
to them and whine about how commercialized it all is: THROW YOUR 
OWN! AND MUTATE IT WHILE YOU'RE AT IT! 

So some of the dinosaurs may not be happy seeing their way of life 
superseded and want to stamp out those noisy critters scampering 
between their feet; more intelligence and greater manoueverability 
will be our response. Haven't we gotten sick enough of the Enemy-
Production Line?

Social transmutation can be fun too, right? There's fun, safe vapid 
alcoholic-nicoteine hedonism, letting off steam so you can return to 
Monday; and then there's fun that aims high, fun allied with Will. The 
path of disciplined excess (??).

But watch this--all those scouting parties of the future will be 
known by their capacity to throw great parties--and pioneer 
partying as a way of throwing off the legacy of the miserable 
Dominator culture we've all had to grow up in.

***

RAVERS, look a little ways forward: have you wondered yet what 
happens once you're burnt out after a year or two of intensive raving, 
once you've lost half your hearing, the beats become stale, and the 
Energy has leaked away. Where, what then?

Define the rave for me.

What does the verb TO RAVE really mean to you?

But first let's list all the stuff that seems to go with it: 
Acid/techno/deep house music; dancing from dusk to dawn; hi-tech 
light shows; lollipops, floppyhats, dayglo pendants, smart drinks; 
$15-20 tickets; zillion gigagawatts sound-systems; X,a cid, nitrous 
and 2CB; goofy outfits, sexy bodies; so many inane and beatific 
smiles...

SHALL we ask together: just what is the essence of a rave?

Suppose, just for a second that we subtract one by one each of the 
above accessories. Stretch your imagination to the limit, and take 
away even, yes, even THE MUSIC; till all we have left are the people, 
all those people who have found each other in this beat, in these 
hidden gatherings, but without the beat, just heartbeat, pulserate, 
breath, ... AND THE EXCHANGE OF LOVE-ENERGIES (isn't that what sex 
is, ultimately?) and each other's presence ... Radiant and revelling in 
our unearthly beauty ... so here we are: much as we adore it, do we 
really need the dance music to affirm our commonality, the patent 
fact that we are siblings of the the same spiritual family who 
through the raves have managed to find one another and in that 
finding remember who each of us truly is, orphan child of eternity. 
Do we need to confuse the rave with the quality of our common 
presence, our moving-loving together; can't we take the essence of 
the rave, freed of all the externals we associate with it, transfer 
and apply that energy elsehwere, to just about anything...?

It comes down to a challenge, a challenge posed in that leap from 
normal space to hyperspace that kicks in when the 'rave' really 
starts to rave: those altered moments when each of us in being 
truest to our uniqueness enters into a harmonious whole; elusive as 
this may be, it calls out, and asks to be realized in every moment of 
our lives; it asks for creation, CREATION OF LIFE, for the nurturing 
of real communities that last deeper & longer than a few hours on 
the dancefloor.

That creative energy, apply it not just to your style of dress but to 
your style of BEING. Free eros & intimacy from the shackles 
socially-inherited sexualities (gay vs, straight, male vs. female), 
from monogamy and the neurotic fixation on genital sexuality: 

YES, CELEBRATE your arrival here at last after a long trek, but don't 
forget, this is only the point of departure. These parties are our 
loading docks and shipyards. (And there is Work to be done: enough 
healing & cleaning for us all.) Here is where we will build not just a 
House, but a ship of dreams, a starship. Woven out of LOVE. CHAOS. 
LAUGHTER.IMAGINATION. WILL. 

And embark; post-nuclear families setting sail out along the 
unwinding multi-dimensional origami strands of alternity...

Our motto:

UTOPIA OR BUST.

Forgive me if this is a redundant question - I've been lurking on and off
lately, and may have missed a crucial message or two.  I heard the Sunset
raves were starting up again on Sundays, and was just wondering if there
is a number to call. Last year's was a BLAST!

Can anyone help me out with this?  If so, see you there!

        Reply to:   RE>>Our Destiny
I don't think Jonas was comtemplating a marketing scheme.
Good raves don't have anything to sell.
Vibe is not a commodity, and it's no one's personal property.
I've never seen anyone turned away from a map point except cops, and
they weren't there to get directions.

take care all!

I've been thinking about this for a long time (and am still discussing
aspects of it with the Captn, especially since he can now see how it works in
.au land)...

I keep coming back to Kurt Cobain, and whether $200 grunge shirts at Macy's
affected his state of mind...

The flaw in the above reasoning is assuming that you can keep the same
character of Vibe after opening up the participation to the larger public. 
This has failed everywhere else - for example, most of us have experienced
reading a newsgroup or mailing list that was great until it became popular. 
Or how about just within raves themselves?  How many times have I read "at
Blah event, don't even arrive until 4 am when the club types have left"?  My
impression is that many local raves have map points mostly to exclude the
sort of people we're contemplating including!

SO, it is not sufficient just to create a marketing scheme for popularizing
rave culture.

It is crucial to come up with some way of doing this WITHOUT losing the Vibe
and just ending up with the format.

Otherwise,  Our Destiny is  the Michael Jackson/Tony Bennett House Party
Album....

thanksyou, thankyou daniel!  yes, this is a great piece - actually written
a few years ago by Jason Keene in his Tribal Doughnut zine.  he's visited
me in london and interviewed me a coupla months ago here in SF for
something (I forget) he now lives in LA and is often seen at the full
moon raves there. he's reminded us, I hope, that we are less talking about
what raves *are* than about what they *can* be.  or, rather, what they
*are* whether we exactly realise it yet or not. fraser

Vision 4/8/95.

I called (415) 905 9629 and heard this (Scottish?) guy
reading an obscure poem. So I called (415) 522 3994
and was told to ring back nearer the time. But it's
only one day away, and I will have to make alternative
plans if I can't find out if/ where/ when this is
happening.

Anyone gotta clue?

Hello everyone. Looking foward to VISION and Sunset.

To the guys putting on sunset. 2 simple suggestions. 1, give a little
better instructions on the vioce mail, make them a little slower. 2,
Give directions from the east as well, ie Sacramento. other than that,
i'm really looking foward to going to Sunset. Last week was so much fun.


Visions. Everyone look for me. Wont be hard. I'll be wearing a shirt
that says GIANT STEP its green. I'll have my Big fluffy brown bear and a
bunch of Vitamin C to give to everyone. Hope to see you there or at
sunset.

When I first when to Community Christophe was playing there and he gave 
me a blinding tape called "The Pressure."  I don't know if he still 
play's there but I would imagine that he does.

Hello,

The New Orb "Orbus Terrarum" is now available domestically.

It is 79:41 on 1 CD (Island Records)  of mysterious, weird and wonderful
music and sounds.

(And I haven't even heard all of it yet!)

No anthems like Little Fluffy Clouds, however.

Less out there than FFWD, but more so than the first album, for example.

Should be widely available.

Chill!

respect to all,

Ken

Well this week was interesting.  I HAD to sit in my car (no car phone while
taking my wife & son to their destination), and endure Michael Krasne
making a concerted effort to link drug use & raves as mututally exclusive
activities.  The show was all about the death on X and raves.  They kept on
citing England and some other nonsense not realted to the American scene.
Some high school senior was one of the guests along with the only "e"
researcher in the USA.  I am glad that they had a, for lack of a better
word, youth, talk about the scene, but her age showed just how limited her
access was to most of the events.  Yes, she had gone to the large Cow
Palace parties, but  really didn;t talk about any other experiences.

Bright spots, several parents called in to say it was no big deal.  About
the X death and all.  A mother of a deceased girl (e related death) called
in and gave the green light to e, despite Krasnes attempts at demonizing
the drug.  What was notcieably absent werfe ANY of the REAL playerrs here
in SF.  Noticeably lacking wwas any of the larger promoters (Preston,
Wicked, Kevin, & Jerry, or Martin), much less any of the people who are
active in the dance culture (DJ's, promoters, SFRaves, etc.).  In other
words it was a kangaroo court on E, raves, and dance culture, with NONE of
it's active participants as part of the conversation.  What a sucky pice of
crap media alert hysteria.  As only KQED can do (is it ANY wonder the left
suffers so miserably in the U.S.).

It's really not suprising though.  With some respect due to KQED for
finding ANYBODY who would step up to the plate, I would say that the
majority of the promoters, etc. are so busy being dodgy, and trying to stay
as anon as possible, that there was little hope of getting any of them to
get on the air and say squat, much less any of the dj's.  A little
organization some years back could have remedieid this, but alas, egos rule
SF, along with great music.

I am sure that the rave community will continue to be misrepresented as
necessary by the media.  Organization would rememedy this mirepresentation,
but there seems to be little will for all involved with dance culture to
unite at this time.  But as I have said before, the tribes MUST eventaully
gather.
++++

The UG I was supposed to be spinning @ is ON this evening.  I will be
spinning this eve.  Write me for details as I do not want this posted to
the list.  The guests include a Mr. Munsen, The Baroness, and PollyWog to
name a few.  The best that can be said is that there should be all kinds of
music played this evening.  I'm looking forward to it!

Bust factor: 0

++++
To all going to Vision, have FUN!  Martin always manages to put on a show,
and is one of the few people responsible for introducing large numbers of
the "youth" to dance culture.  Right on Martin!

Im out.
++++

Late,
John

Everyone should experience this at least once(you will probably go more
than once). It is a totally different experience, something that you can't
really experence very often. I know this is to vauge, but go anyways.

Also, wear clothes that can get ruined, don't wear anything nice it will be
wine soaked among other things.

Tristan, you really should get your own account instead of using Kevin's.
I mean this.  It is a serious breach of net etiquette not to sign your
own name to things you post here, and it is less than adequate to continue
using someone else's account in a regular way.

As for the fact you personally called me "ignorant," your words stand on
your own and you can pound sand as far as I'm concerned pal.

I suggest everyone IGNORE or send to /dev/null anything from Tristan.
I *mean* that.  We don't need this kind of negativity and egomania here.

As for Kevin, I talked with him in person at some length last Sunday and
hope he will be active himself here on the list again.  Kevin and Tristan
are completely different people and it's only an accident of circumstance
that finds them using the same account.  

Enough on this.  I'm not even going to bother flaming Tristan for his
superfluous personal insult of me, it's not worth the energy or bandwidth.

See ya

A further thought on The Imaginal Rave (the "gargantuan letter" posted 
once again [thanks] yesterday):


I love the incoming wave analogy, which sees the rave scene as another 
wave emanating from the same source as the late-60s wave. But there were 
other waves before that, and you might find their timing interesting: 


1910-1914 (with echoes into the '20s): An entirely new lifestyle "for the 
20th century" introduced, with a new prototype for relationships, both 
temporary and lasting, which finally loosened (didn't quite break) the 
repressive Victorian mold. This was accompanied by a HUGE dance craze.

1844-1850s: The flowering (and public acceptance) of the Romantic Era, 
introduced by a few free thinking pioneers in the 1830s. This was 
accompanied by a huge dance craze.


Note: I happen to think of the 50s beat-to-rock era as an early form of 
the late-60s counterculture, but together comprising one era. You might 
disagree.


So this is what you see when you plot all of this over time:


      xXXXxx                   xxXXxxxx          xXXxxXXx     xxXX 
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
30  40  50  60  70  80    1900  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  


... more or less.  Increasing frequency of the oncoming waves.


Probably not a full generation 'till the next one. When they finally 
connect, seque together, without the droughts in between, is this the 
Hundredth Monkey?

Thanks to those sending feedback to my rave history posting. For those 
speculating on the next wave, let me offer my two cents worth here.

If you have no interest in rave history/future speculation, that's fine 
with me. Simply skip on to the next posting.


My original posting (repeated at the end of this one) proposed that the 
positive energy of the current rave scene just might be part of an ongoing 
series of new waves. IF this pattern continues for another cycle, it is 
due in 2010-15. 

The future cannot be extrapolated from any ongoing patterns, of course. 
But this MIGHT just happen in a BIG way in 2010 because of a
concurrence with another, unrelated, dynamic:

This is the pattern is found in the years 1410, 1510, (skips once to 1750 
for sociopolitical reasons), 1810, 1910, and...?

(1810 was not the major change of the century, not compared to 
1844, but the Regency Era was nevertheless a significant ripple of 
fresh energy, accompanied by, yes, a new dance craze that included 
the introduction of the waltz to many countries.)

This pattern is that of a Coming New Century, with accompanying 
expectations for Great Change. Of course, the expectations are not 
based on anything more real than an arbitrary calendar, and thus 
should carry no real influence, UNLESS you have an entire population 
BELIEVING that a change is due. Then it becomes real.

The changes do not occur on the exact century mark, because a numeral
is not a true catalyst for change. But after a few years, people become 
disappointed that the expected changes did not occur, restless for some-
thing fresh, and much more open (or less resistant) to new ideas. 
This delayed fuse usually takes about one decade to ignite change.

You might say that people will accept ANY change ten years into a 
century, not necessarily because it has great merit, but simply because 
the time is right. Ragtime-music-to-early-jazz, tango, blues, etc. became 
mainstream for this century because they happened to be the newest
music and dance in 1910? Some of us think they were great, others say it 
was just the timing.


Back to the first pattern, the lifestyle-change waves that hit in the 
1840s-50s, 1910s-20s, 1950s-60s and now:

If these waves of positive, creative, transcendental energy are
indeed arriving in a regular, accelerating pattern, with the next one 
due in 2010, I think there is a very good chance that it will catch and 
ride on the OTHER 2010 wave, the new-century one. 

Resulting in a tsunami? 

We'll soon see.


Richard

I love your time wave posts, Art history, intellectual or literary history thrills 
me when its ravey. I remember hearing Terrence Mckenna give a talk and he 
got a bit of art history (bosch) backward and It made me think : if this guy 
has a degree in art history and he is getting his exampes wrong, how is his 
science (time waves, electron spins)? It comes down to facination is more 
important than fact.

nationalism, sexism, racism-- how about the predjudice  of stereotyping 
somebody according to the time they were born, know as astrology.

I like the idea david and I have been discussing this last fortnight: a 
questionnaire that measures you attitudes to change and the future and 
tells you what year you are living in.  elvis fans would be living in the 
'50s, say, or punks in the middle '80s.  some of us would be living in 
the future.
great to meet you guys today, and phred DJing when we came in with the 
dutch tv crew.  and the historical backporch and we got the producer to 
dance for a moment though not captured on film, and a scotsman DJs next.
on the way to the shop they did this amazing thing where tom and I walked 
the whole length of a block of haight st5reet on a busy saturday with the 
camera crew GOING BACKWARDS filming us - obviously a technique they've 
worked out, with holds of the elbow, and the director waalking forwards 
ahead etc.  anyway it should be a great long shot.  it'll be out in 2 
weeks. we'll forward you a copy.

incidentally I wanted to comment on our attiudes to the press.  what you 
said about nevertrusting the press is still true today for the daily 
newspapers.  they only want sensationalism and I am quite sure they will 
be starting to demonise RC this summer.  word is coming down from the top 
and from the Subconscious that RC is getting powerful.

but magazines are a whole other matter.  only once a month they deal in  
dif3errent level, and level of readers.  they want some more depth.  and 
my finding last year with the tour was that the people who work for the 
monthlies are pretty much ravers themselves.  and so it becomes a conspiracy 
between them and us to get some truth past the owners.
fraser.
I'm a unicorn with penis rising in your anus, by the way.

a one hour trip from one airport to another very similar airport and a
town that reminds you of lot of other towns.  a Parllel Uni trip takes you
to a whole diferent airport in a whole diferent town.  no peanuts but the
latest smart sex/Romance drinks and etc. (and we try to keep booze ou of
the atmosphere) and it lasts all night and many creative people are
involved.  semms about right to me. 

>the smart drink fad is dead-discuss..

it's back to booze and ex, is it?  or are we all going to sip perrier?  I
think the smart prosex drinks are a halfway stage to that where we're
taking milder but interestingly psychostimulants in experimentsal
synergetic combos within the law.  more senstiive, more intelligent.  and
natural highs too.  all very positive and not a matte5r of fsashion at
all, though big changes do come in growing waves. this is like ht 
discussion about when was the first second summer of loe?  I say history 
records when it goes GLOBAL.  I say smart drinks will be replacing Java 
House within a couple of years. not that I'd bet on it or anything.

>S.F. isn't the place to hock pro-unsafe-sex environments-have aids
>victims > died in vain?-ponder... 

why unsafe?  although I don't think anything like that was going on at the 
last Chemica Sutra, it's a big house and I admit I wasdn't encouraging 
staff to go round checking, but why assume it's unsafe?  more safe than 
any booze paty - after all it's set in an atmosphere of intelligent 
discussion, older people are present too, including a baby, etc etc. 
intelligent attitudes to everything, sex, drugs etc.  what are we 
supposed to learn from AIDS, then?  that Sex is a thing of the past or 
something? anyway I actually think PRO SEX PLUS is more a romantic 
substance, and I know Dan Joy (and myself) are trying to explore a bigger 
wider thing about SEX as sexual energy as Life-Affirming energy.  et etc

>

me?  self proclaimed music expert. ten bucks for any statement in my entire 
career where I've pontificated on music?  I'm much more the guy who 
doesn't know who's DJing, long ago packed his rock'nroll stars off the 
stage etc.  what I did say, though, is that I know a bit about Trance. 
and about shamanic drumming states and some of the differences between 
a party and an evolutionary experiment and etc   

and where is any mention of "introducing .. huggytrance?"  if I take a
shit in the toilet am I to be acused of trying to introduce SF to it? 
actually the music Paul Q plays is happy, witty stuff, a pe4sonal choice
and not very trancey at all - though we will start introducing trance at
the Cyberlab7Safari

one last thing.  the Parallel University tries to explore evolutionary
frontier areas in as subversively edutaining a manner possible.  we happen
to be dealing with SEX because we were invited to do a book rave launch
for the new book Better Sex Through Chemistry and made that our first
topic of the year. 

next we do Virtual Reality as a theme on May 12th. 

however, because the "mix" we created with the first Chemica Sutra was so
"Romantic" and "Very Safe & Caring" we are repeating it with new ideas and
having serious discussions about making it much bigger nad then touring
it, with ties to the book which I am perfectly cerain will sell a million
and a half coplies wordlwide.  good luck to them say I.  whether it's
exactly what the planet is waziting for it's one of the technologies we
should know about, that's for sure.  

I think the June Parallel University will be Politics, Rave Culture and
the Third Millennium of the United NAtions.  all right?  or would we be
accused of introducing "politics" ino the RC here?  >:-)

Hi, all!

Liquid Air was a blast (of cool air :-), and many thanks for your thoughts,
and to those who came out.  Things got rolling a bit late, since the bulk
of folks came by later.  But when we reached critical mass, we
set up in a hurry, and got down to some fun music.  Phred and a friend
(sorry, i can't remember his name) tag teamed for almost two hours...some
really wonderful stuff.  Joe followed, then Alex, then Phred closed us off
for the evening.  We did get visited by the police, and this part is the
real message.  I had a long conversation with two of the police, and there
was a lot of information that was exchanged that may be of benefit to
others considering events at our chosen location.  (send me email if you
need to know where we had the event).

When we noticed that we were being observed, I immediately began walking
toward the parking area.  They had shined their light on us (which clued
us in that we had visitors from the police).  As i walked toward the 
parking area, they turned off their light, stopped the motor in their
vehicle, and got out of the cruiser.  I asked them if i could help them.
They asked me what i could help them with, and i said i wasn't sure, but
thought i should come over and talk with them to see if they had any concerns.
they asked me if i was responsible for this, and i said yes, since it was
my sound system and invitation that had gotten this rolling.  it also gave
them one person to talk with (and possibly cite) instead of several.

They reported their location, saying that it was an illegal rave, and began
walking toward the dance area (which was about 100 yards away).  They asked
me why i thought we could do this at that location.  I said that i believed
that we were at a public park.  they asked me why i thought that, and i 
said that it was marked as such on the maps i had seen, and that there
seemed to be publicly maintained structures at the site.  They asked me
if i was aware that public parks in san francisco were closed after 10PM.
i said no, that i wasn't aware of any such thing, and thanked them for
telling me so.  They then speculated that if this were private property,
and we had the permission of the owner, that would be our best move.  i
thanked the officer who informed me of that.

First and foremost on their minds was to know if we were charging admission
or taking money.  This was easy to answer, since it was advertised,
intended and executed as a free party.  They were quite skeptical on this
point, so i explained how I owned the sound system, rented a very small
generator, and invited a few friends to come listen to some music in a 
place where noise wasn't going to be a problem.  All the complete truth.
I also explained that the generator was one of the quietest ones made.
They said they'd have to take a look at that, which we did, later on.

We were walking towards the dance area (and the music had been turned
down somewhat), and they looked around at folks.  They then asked their
question again about asking for money.  They also asked if people were
drinking alcohol.  Again, i said that i had seen a few bottles, but had
asked folks to cap it and take it back to their cars if i had seen it.
They asked if there were minors present, and said how minors and alcohol could
be a problem.  I said that some of the folks seemed like they might be
minors, but i had no way of knowing.  

We then talked about the sound system, and how we could not be charging
admission.  since i owned the soundsystem and had a receipt for the
generator (they looked at the marking on the generator), the answer
was quite simply that it cost next to nothing to put on, and was just
a way for us to play some music without bothering anyone. one officer
asked me "you aren't receiving any remuneration for your sound system,
the person playing the music isn't getting paid, you're not getting
any money at all for this?"  i said no, i owned the sound system, and
there was absolutely no money exchanged for anything, no goods, no
services, no use fees, no money at all.

They started asking me questions about safety.  i informed them that i
had friends looking out for mischief on a regular basis, and that we
had set up in such an obvious place so we could have clear lines of sight
all around us, to help us be aware of trouble well before things got
difficult.  They asked me what we would do if some of the neighbors
("White kids!" they said, with a touch of disbelief in their voices)
drove by and just shot into the park.  how can one answer a question
like that?  i just reiterated that we were keeping an eye on the parking
area, and hoped to be able to avoid a situation like that.

An officer took me aside and shone his flashlight on the ground, and said,
"Look at that!"  i had a hard time distinguishing what he was pointing
at, and asked him "look at what?"  He then looked me right in the eye,
making his displeasure and disbelief very clear and said that he didn't
care about me or my sound system, and that he thought i was bullshitting.
since i had no reason to assume he cared about either me or my sound
system, that didn't phase me.  since i wasn't bullshitting him at all,
i just took this as information about his attitude about what i was
saying...again, no surprises.  He pointed out some charred wood, and
said, "One thing we *don't* like out here is fires.  That looks like
you guys were having a fire out here.  We don't like fires.  What does
that look like to you?"  I said, "it looks as if someone had a fire
and it's out now."  The officer then asked me if we had made a fire,
and i answered, truthfully, that no, we had not made a fire.  The
officer reiterated that he thought i was bullshitting him, and said
he would make me a deal:  "if i go over there and it's warm, that
means you guys made a fire.  if it's warm, i'm going to throw you and
your sound system into the bay.  how's that for a deal?"  i said that
was fine, since i *knew* that i had been on the spot for at least
four hours, and no one had made a fire.  i was also betting on the man's
integrity, that if he went over, and felt cold ashes, that he would
report them as cold and not throw me and my sound system into the bay
(and a yukky spot on the bay it was, believe me...i prolly would have
gotten sick just from the water :-( ).  He put his hand into the ashes,
and said, OK, went back to his posse (now grown to four officers),
greeted the newcomers, and asked them if they wanted to stay and dance.
they laughed and said it wasn't their kind of music.  the officers
turned to me and told me to keep it under control, and then left. i
then realized there was another cruiser (probably a sergeant's or
lieutenants, since it was all white) in the parking area.  they went 
over and talked with the officer(s) in that car, and all left shortly
thereafter.

i think the officers and i covered a lot of ground that all people
considering outdoor and nightime events should be aware of. of course,
this is my personal take on the lessons learned, YMMV, and all that. 

it is
necessary for whoever is talking with them to be sober, responsible,
and believable, probably also well over 18.  the person(s) should be
willing to take responsibility for the entire event.  it is best to
meet the police as soon as they are recognized, and well away from
the main area that people are hanging out.  the person talking with
them should keep them engaged as much as possible...as we were walking
toward the dance area, several people passed us, and were paid no
heed.  The person(s) should believe that what they are doing is 
perfectly legal, and as safe as possible.  the person should recognize
the limits of the safety they can provide to people, and be willing
and able to discuss *in detail* what measures are being taken to ensure
the safety of the people there. the person shouldn't be naive, nor try
to persuade the police that there are neither minors nor alcohol present,
and should have a detailed account of what they personally have done to
prevent public consumption of alcohol, and promote safety.  the
person must be able to deal with any good cop/bad cop behavior.  the
person should be as truthful as possible, and able to deal with police
telling them that they and their possessions are of no concern.  the
person must also be willing to deal with a factual test of some kind.
courtesy, coolness, and a willingness to take the rap (if necessary)
are also required...it's a big, bad world, and the cops make the rules
when they come into contact with you. it is best to simply accept
that and answer their questions carefully and thoughtfully, saying no
more or less than you *know* to be a fact.

i hope this anecdote may be of use to you or one of your friends.

great stuff, SOrmsby, newcomer like me, huh?  

beauty like yours shining through is one of the rewards for all this time 
on the front lines.  thanks and I'm sure I speak for all.

one disagreement though.  about the meme spreading.  again it's this time 
differential.  how long can tings go on as bad as they are?  I'm not 
talking morally even?  if a thing is riddled with contradictions from top 
to bottom ... you see, you describe this emptiness at the heart of every 
so-called "modern civilised man" but then don't make the next step that 
RC is for them too.  OK it might not be quite so mystical as what's here 
in SF but it's still shamanic dancing etc etc.  still one hell of a lot 
better than the dreary rock they've got now.

and, once we've looked deep in our hearts as is also, of course, HALF the 
spiriual trip, as you saay, and when we see that WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE 
PLANET WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES   AND WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND 
OURSELVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE PLANET maybe we'll see, what I 
describe as the zippy, that we have to work/play for that balance 
on the planet too.  and that RC is actually the new culture that needs 
to become dominant very quickly is *already here*.  that's all. fraser

Rawk out!  Cheers to all going to ol Sioux and the Spiritualized kids 
this Monday...
(I know she ain't rave, but one listen of "The Rapture" song, Belladonna, 
etc, and she's still magic...and our beloved Spaceman jason, helping to 
lift us up)
people of the largely Spiritualized persuasion have chided at someone so 
theatrical and fabulous as Sioux and her "long, sad decline into 
synthesized cabaret music", but maybe they'll be pleasantly surprised.

Phantasmic moments and ethereal bliss out, blues edged, yes please!
(sorry rave list police, some rants can't be contained)
Psst- speaking of other stuff- Sunday April 9, 2 and 7:30 pm, Opera 
House, standing room $7-  L a m b a r e n a   the West African choral and 
drumming and Bach mutation, the hit ballet piece danced to it, dance, 
"the universal language"  See ya there!

Dear All;

	I have but one word for Siouxsie, one of the most haunting female
voices of the punk era, and possibly our time, she it one of the
exceptions to long list of "punk/gothic/hardcore bands" I've had the
pleasure of seeing, on a scene in Phila, that for the most part was pretty
cool, way back in the late 70's early 80's, that is, and in my opinion
everything Grace Slick never was, and wanted to be, just me opinion though.

	I would highly recommend picking up the CD titled the singles, 
were she is at her best, hard, fast, and of course always haunting and 
mistertious.

Peace & Love
Brian Darkness

Dear All;

	I'm glad things worked out with the police, I personnally wish that
people would just keep there alcoholic beverages in there cars. If you are
at an outdoor event, there's just no reason to bring them into the event
area. Is it that much to ask of someone to keep them in their cars, and
when their thiristy go back and drink by your car to your hearts content.

	I just think its sooo selfish of people who don't want to have the
minor inconvience of walking back to their cars to get their drinks.
Instead they risk having the party busted, a major inconvience for
everyone, it just doesn't make sense to me. People at our events need to
me more responsible, and think a lot more, we could minize negative police
interaction by just doing a few simple things. I have never been busted
for drugs or alcohol in 20 years of partying(knock on wood), I have a
simple expression that I say to myself when I start to get a little lazy,
or careless, "better safe than sorry", once something happens you can't
change it, but a little precaution a head of time can save you a lifetime
of hassle.  Just something to think about, because its to late when your
in jail and the party's busted.

Dear Timothy;

	There's being stereotyped, and then there's out and out dishonest 
press. The press we have been refering to comes to us with often a hidden 
agenda, under the guise of helping our scene. This is no more that lieing 
to people, they aren't very honest about what they are printing, its just 
lies.

	Again I feel we don't need the mainstream press, we have the 
internet, I would be interested in you indicating to me a mainstream 
factual rave press source. Life is not black and white, it is always a 
shade of grey, and often, but not always, the press doesn't print things 
that are life affirming, just bad news. I challedge you to pick up any 
printed news source and count the - and the + articles, and I guarentee 
you that the - ones will out number the + ones by at least 10 to 1, and 
I'm sorry but I believe that there are more + things going on in our 
world today than are given credit for by the press.

	Carlos Santana was involved in a project for creating a TV 
channel dedicated to the dignity of man, as opposed to what going on out 
there today, things like OJ.

Hi Allen:

Thanks for the note >> I love your time wave posts...>>
 

> It comes down to facination is more important than fact.


Yeah, and I have a concern along that line about these speculations (the 
2010 vision). 

Remember Jose Arguelles' _Transformative_ Vision_? 
He came up with a prediction of a different kind, published it, and found 
that it was picked up bigtime by the new age set, who almost turned it 
into some sort of spiritual Second Coming, which they called the Harmonic 
Convergence. Right?

Arguelles played along with it as it mutated through the pre-HC hype, 
as the prediction date neared, then it turned out to be a fizzle. A FUN 
fizzle for those who gathered on mountaintops at sunrise, but it 
knocked the credibility of the new age movement down half a notch.

So did Arguelles place fascination over fact, or did his readers? 
Or did he let his following draw himself into the hype?


Fascination is fine. The possibility of these incoming waves of 
enlightenment finally taking root before dissolving is more than 
fascinating! ...which makes me all the more careful about the tendency to 
believe what we want to believe, replacing our simply (and directly) being 
right with what is happening now and nourishing it on to the next step
...the direct nonanalylitical experience that is an essence of raving.


Hope to cross paths some day.

Richard

Dear All;

	I would just like to give love, praise, a million little smiley
faces and thanks to all the wonderful womyn on our list who continue to
lead by example(the true & most effective form of leadership), resisting
this negative example set by some of the men here, by not flaming and not
participating in, what I'm sorry to say is "male ego bullshit", that has
been dominateing our list as of late. I would pick and personnally deliver
to you all a big bunch of wild flowers if I knew where you all lived :). I 
pray that the womyn of the world today, lead us all to a better way of 
respectful, affirming communication. 

	Personnally I have never received a flame from a womyn, just their
private honest feelings about what I've had to say. Please continue this
example, because I, if no one else does, appreciate and recogizes the
amount of real courage it takes to put your heart, soul and feelings on the 
line. 

	Any idiot can flame you, this is not courage or mach-cizmo, just
incredible misery & insecurity, and to all our flamers, everyone on this
list knows it. So do us and most important yourselfs a favor, and don't
insert your keyboard in your mouth, I promise you'll feel a lot better.

	     Peace, Love & Thanks From Across Cyberspace

 Well , I just bought my first Jungle mix tape today at Ameba. It's by a 
DJ Ocean - the insert graphic is a bunch of gigantic chrome orbs floating
over the ocean. I really like it! They had another Jungle tape that I
didn't like so much , as there was a lot of Jamacian "toasting" on it,
which I'm not much of a fan of. So far , as I'm listening to it, the
DJ Ocean tape keeps the "toasting" to a minimum - much more cool instrumental
stuff in crazy syncopation. 

 This style of music may be the final trigger to get me to update my 
pathetic car stereo system to something that actually has clean(er)
bass below 100HZ. The deep bass is "sane" enough to move your feet 
to , while the crazy syncopation of the midrange/treble tweaks the 
arms and the brain. I can't imagine dancing to this stuff without
the support of a dancable bass pattern.

 I hope more DJs incorporate Jungle into the music played in the main dance
rooms at raves , instead of keeping it seperate or absent.

I heard that David Rhodes was indited by a federal grand jury for
rackettering charges and is scheduled for a trial date this summer.  Anyone
distributing the FAST CASH email is subject to intense scrutiny from the
FBI.

I would advise students that distribute the email to contribute $50
to the David Rhodes defense fund or their whole life may be ruined.

Hi Fraser,

Glad to see you're back.

Hmm, I don't know.  There is a certain amount of ritual associated with
coffee drinking that has been amassed over the last few millenia that would
be hard to overcome.   Have you ever made your own cup of expresso?  For me
its become an elaborate ritual in the morning that serves to focus me and
bring a smile to my face.  Smart drinks because they are not as accessible
may not lend themselves to ritualization and java houses.

Looking forward to the next Chemica Sutra,

PT

[ Broadcast to sfraves ]
This is the list of musical "bass test" recordings that folks recommended to 
me. ( I had asked for recordings that had low frequency content down to 30HZ , 
and where also enjoyable to listen to .) Thanks for the hints!
                                          Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - In addition to the recordings listed below - Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of 
 The Moon" has a good deep heartbeat at the beginning of one of the cuts. Also
 a nice section where all sorts of mechanical clock alarms and chimes are
 going off simultaneously  - a nice high frequency test.
-------------------------
 808 State "Excel", or LFO "Frequencies" which has a bass warning on the label.
-------------------------
...  my favorite low (frequency) test tracks consist of pipe organ music. 
Try BACH BUSTERS...
-------------------------
Symphony of the Planets 1: NASA Voyager Recordings
This will knock you on your ass, if I may be so blunt :)
-------------------------
Exist Dance "Transmitting from Heaven" CD compilation - "we're go: stage one"
by (if i remember correctly) High Lonesome Sound System.
-------------------------
The one that comes to mind is
"BASS 305: DIGITAL BASS (by DM Records) contains fundamentals close to 20 Hz.
If you want to go below that, the 1812 Overture by TELARC contains one of
the lowest recorded fundamentals (10 Hz at -120 dB ref 20uPa).
-------------------------
 Basshead disks, and very few classical selections featuring
Contra-Oboes(?). Most of the lowest bass you find in regular disks is
about 50-60 hz, and that is the heavy rap. Most of the stuff I have heard
(Bass 305, Bass to the Future, Techno-Bass) are very one-dimentional and
aren't very musical. I know you say no test disks, but I have one from
Carver that I use with my system. It features a full-range of test tones,
including pink and white noise, in and out of phase freqs AND 4 songs
that range from swing to new-age to jazz, which covers the full range.
-------------------------
DJ Magic Mike:  Bass, the Final Frontier...
>From Miami of course
Go to Rasputins, they have a "bass" section!
-------------------------
try THIS IS ACID JAZZ.
either the second or third track is FANTASTIC>>>>>>>>>>>
-------------------------
... Track 9, "Ketamine Entity", off of "Colourform" by the Higher Intelligence 
Agency has some crazy low bass. For something a little more analog 
(real drums), "Dafos", by Mickey Hart, Airto, and Flora Purim has some good, 
low kettle drums in it. Heres a more formal listing:

LFO - Frequencies , Tommy Boy TBCD1048
Higher Intelligence Agenciy - Colourform , Waveform 84102-2 (esp. Track 9)
Dafos - Mickey Hart, Airto, Flora Purim , Ryko RCD 10108
-------------------------
Try the first Tracy Chapman record or _The Nightfly_ by Donald Fagan.

Or one of those Bassomatic records you'll find in mass quantities in
the "used" bin at Wherehouse.

Or anything by dub dudes Scientist or Prince Far I.
-------------------------
i picked up this used cd in a pawn shop called "Bass Cube" which
is hip-hoppish, miami techno with lots of really low bass, probably
atleast 30hz.  th cd is on Pandisc records out of miami.
-------------------------
Young American Primitive's self titled album.
Ambient/trance type stuff with a purply-pink cover with satellite dishes on
it.  Perhaps you already have it.  Anyway there's a song on there called
Monolith that's in 2 parts.  The first part has this incredible throbbing
bass that swells up and down the lower frequency range from about 250hz down
to sub-audible frequencies (i.e. less than 20 hz).  If you want to test bass
response, I can't think of anything better.  I have some pretty decent
speakers, but I can hear their minor flaws when I play this track.
-------------------------
A little late, and a little old, but try Drugs Work from the original
tresor comp on novamute nmcd3002.

  I would happily accept any virtual flowers, but I'd like to note that my 
gender is unrelated to my lack of participation in these past flames. I'd 
also like to offer "love, praise, a million little smiley faces and 
thanks to all the wonderful" *PEOPLE* on this list who "continue to lead 
by example"!

(Thanks, Brian, but lets embrace our list-mates' wonderfulness without 
descriminating against anyone on the basis of their gender.)

Love,

Vibe tribe report
=================

Well,  time once again for yet another report on the rave scene here
in Sydney.

This weekend was the VIbe Trib outdoor party in Sydney park.   We heard
on the radio that the location was fairly easy to get to,   so we headed
out there to check it out.

The location is at an old industrial park,  at the St Peters train station.
Sure enough as we got off the train,  we heard the music.   The party
was much bigger than I expected,   but it was certainly underground.

The soud system was set up against an old brick wall or building,   decorated
by black light posters.   Out away from the dance area was the grassy part,
where people were hanging out and chilling.

Almost immediatly I started dancing,   but the DJ was changing the beats
around with almost every song.   Certainly wasn't continious.   But when
the other DJ went on,   the energy picked up considerably.   Sometime later,
they were making an anouncement asking the crowd to not let the police get
anywhere near the turn tables.   But as I looked around,   I couldn't see
anything,  so I continued dancing.    The vibe was amazing,   a lot like
the Sunset parties in SF.    Eventually,   sometime around 2 am,  the cops
tried to charge into the group of people dancing near the front,   but
the crowd defiently deflected most of them back towards the edge.    A
person was up there asking people to stand form,  saying "We have a right
to be here,  just like anyone else" ..   Finally the cops backed off,  and
the dancing continued.   It was short lived though,  as the cops were staying
back to re-group.   This time,   they charged into the group of happy dancing
folks,   getting mean and violent,  literally knocking down anyone in their
way.    They dragged off several people,  one of which was the promoters,
without regard for the groups safety.   One of the vibe tribe members was
injured badly in the fracus,  but the ravers stood their ground and chanted
"We just want to dance...!".   Then other people were yelling "Go out and
stop the muggers and leave us alone"... Others were saying "Look,  they
are vndelizing your car,  go and stop them...".

Eventually the cops found the generator,  shut it down,  and carted it out.
Immediatly the group carted out the bongo drums and started drumming and
defying the cops in any way possible.   WoW!!  would have to say,  these
Aussies got balls,  because the group just refused to leave.   More cops
arrived,   as the promoters were negotiating with the supervisor,  and the
cops were also being especially nasty.   They eventually backed off,  and
allowed the drumming to continue.

All in all,  I'm told that 17 people were arrested,   and a half hour later,
the media showed up,   but we left after that,   and I headed over to another
party called MORPH,  but at about 5 am,  things looked pretty dead,  but I met
one of the vibe tribe members that got injured,   who later asked if I
would join in a game of billiards,   afterwards,  I finally left and headed
over to Recovery.    Recovery was practically dead most of the afternoon,
then eventually went home for a while.

Later on,  towards the evening,  I headed back to recovery,  when things started
to get hopping,  and "Shade", this new DJ was just getting on.   Some people
came up to me and said "This DJ is the best in Sydney".   Shade started off
with some slower tunes (around 140 bpm),   but gradually,  the beats started
to pick up.    WOW!  This guy was amazing,  scratching to 160 BPM beats,
literalyy tearing my head to schreds,  as he gradually worked from trance to
hard core.   At the end of his set,  he was somewhere around 220 BPM's,
literally taking off.  WOW!!  Now I see why this dude is so good.

After his set,  Akira went on,  and kept the "Doof Doof" sounds going for the
remainder of his set as well.   I eventually left,   after that,  visited
some friends until late in the early hours of Monday morning.

WOW!!  Another crazy weekend in Sydney...

I have inclosed some additional comments from some of the other AusRavers
on the insanity that happened in Sydney last Sat evening.  It appears
there is  GLOBAL crackdown on raving world wide,  with the Criminal
Justice bill,   San Franciso SOMA crackdowns,   and now Sydney Australia.

Ravers do they now have to hide in parks?
by RosieX


About 2.30am Sunday, April 9. "Freequency" a rave organised by vibe
tribe and other peace lovin' party goers, experienced the wrath of
Sydney police.

It was horrific to witness the brutality of police toward ravers at this
community event held at Sydney Park, and I urge those who attended
to document the event, make official complaints and call for
an inquiry.

Reminiscent of the riots one hears and reads about..in connection
with the Criminal Justice Act, in England..Sydney Park has by default
become a "terrain of terror" for party goers and what is inevitably to
become an embarrassing blot for police records and accountability.

And be accountable they should be!

With well over 40 cops in attendance; 18 police cars, paddy wagons and
a contingency of police rescue, the situation escalated well out - of -
control and lasted for approx 45 minutes.

Many of the 300 ravers who attended the party were either intimidated,
arrested, muzzled, beaten and restrained for refusing to turn off the
music and allow police access to the generator.

To try and close the party and impound the cleverly hidden and buried
generator, (which allowed the dj's to defiantly play on)..the police
arrived for a showdown and what can only be best described as looking
for trouble.

Frustrated by their inability to locate the power source and unsuccessfully
arrest leaders and party organisers the police lost it, and lost it
completely.

Being more stoopid than brave, I tried to find out exactly who was in
charge of the cops. Like a Monty Python skit and thinking themselves
rather funny..more than 12 cops turned to me and synchronistically said
"WE ALL ARE"! A kind of honest joke, anarchist and rave organisers often
say that no one single person is in charge, everyone is and its true..

"Ha Ha Ha Ha Anarchist cops" someone said.

With smugness and truncheons on their side, the cops continued to make
smart arse remarks about The Young Ones and ape the crowd.

I didn't find it amusing, nor do I ever find it acceptable that cops
somehow always believe they are above reproach or accountability. Have
you ever noticed at a rave how when dealing with people, cops think
working class feral scum have no brains and can be booted around like a
footie ball.

Standing in scrum like fashion for at least an hour before deciding to
"attack" not one police person as far as I witnessed tried to be
reasonable or indeed communicate why on earth the party should be closed
down. Why public assembly with relatively hard core techno beats with not
a residential house in sight for miles is so threatening to societal
stability is anyone's guess.

With toffy nosed middle class muscle I said.."well thats not acceptable
who's in charge"..The senior officer then sheepishly stepped forward
& not introducing himself said "I am".

"Well, its completely out of control", I said. "People have every right
to gather in a public space and you are not only causing trouble,
you're escalating it"!  "And btw, (empowered by the moral agency of being
right)..I continued, why don't your officers have their badges on, whats
going on that no one is prepared to identify themselves!"

With shouts of support and ravers wanting to know if tax payers (including
our own tax $) were indulging this "park de theatre" and picking up the
tab for the night's fiasco; the officer in charge agreed that under the
circumstances yes things had gotten a bit "out of hand"..

"If you know who is organising the party and what time it will finish
perhaps I can do something" he said. "Well you better do something
quickly (I said) you've got officers beating up on people and I just
witnessed a woman who was about to get her skulled cracked for protecting
a friend, I doubt this is the sort of publicity you want and its not
doing much for police public relations is it."  "Hell its a party in a
park not a war"..

With that he turned and walked away to discuss the situation with some
plain clothes dudes who all similarly had stunned mullet expressions and
mobile phones.

At this stage I was thrown aside so more ravers could be loaded in the
back of paddy wagons and with shouts from inside of "anyone remember
Nuremberg" I felt anxious about my friends having to spend the night in
jail and having to succumb to the intimidatory tactics of a seemingly
inhuman group of people bent on asserting the one true goal of a
totalitarian state *power*!..

Ravers need to educate themselves about their rights, we need to know
and exercise our legal rights in order that the police do not exceed
theirs.

Footnote..

A lot of the ravers were released from the paddy wagons before they
arrived at Newtown police station. In defiance some people played music
on acoustic instruments and stayed behind in the park, public land, to
exercise their rights. The generator was finally discovered and impounded
and the chai tea flowed on til dawn.

                Police Crash Party and Smash Heads.


Marrickville and Newtown police stations emptied themselves last night,
Saturday 8th April 1995, and 40 police complete with attack dogs,
Police_Rescue vans (obviously the'd been watching too much TV ;-) and
eager truncheons crashed a beautiful Vibe Tribe party in Sydney park. The
site of the old brickworks looked apocalyptic, hung with luminescent
mandalas and ultra-violet tubes, the ominous old smoke stacks flashed with
light against a night sky ripped with deep velvet-blue and pearl clouds,
backlit with a silver moon. The fabric of the sky looked dipped in gold
dust as people coalesced for the good vibe. "The music was new black
polished chrome, and came over the summer like liquid night...".
Firedancers entranced us, the rhythms resonated with something deep,
people wailed with delight. And after several failed attempts to shut
down the sound, the cops truncheoned their way in to the heated core of
dance, ripping out the two generators powering the music. Suddenly the
whole thing came a lot closer to apocalypse. Music equipment was pulled
from the tables onto the ground and to my knowledge to attempt  was made
by the police to explain their actions or give reason for the attack.

Obviously with police who do not only fail to question their individual
actions, who substitute a personal grasp of right and wrong for the
robotic programming of an attack dog, it is futile to even attempt to
communicate. But to those cops whom I told "tonight you are doing the wrong
thing", nothing but barked abuse and baton-butts came in reply. I would
have expected a little more at a party. What was this? The only thing I can
think that could be construed as a problem would be the noise level, and
even that idea was ridiculous given that in the courtyard of the brickworks,
surrounded by walls and a huge hill, and situated right next door to an
industrial complex, and not to mention the absolute absence of all
reference to residential complaints (if there had been any  residents
near enough to complain), this didn't seem to be the issue.

Indeed it is not the issue. The police were subjected to utter ridicule
from the moment they arrived, they were informed quite accurately of
their anal-retentive incapacities and sarcastically congratulated for
fucking up an otherwise harmless and primal celebration. They did not all
wear their identity badges (surprise surprise) and I saw them drag a
number of party-goers out by the throat into the waiting paddy-wagons
which were stacked across the footpath, looking like a car lot. It's no
wonder when faced by such bitter opposition, and an opposition who so
easily laid plain the utter stupidity of their jobs and lives, the cops
acted in violence out of sheer frustration at the intense freedom
lived and danced by everyone else who was there. The sad thing is that
our society, that's us, pays for these people to be fucked up to the
stage where they can't negotiate, can't communicate and can't accomplish
any meaningful thing without resorting to force and violence.

This police fuck-up will count as a large black mark against the image
of the police, their perceived ability to act like human beings and to in
some way justify their number and power. It is a sad, sad fact that in Sydney
Australia, people cannot gather in a public park to play music and dance
without being pounced upon by the cops. It's also sad that 40 fully
paid, trained, armed and uniformed police and their dogs and vehicles have
nothing better to do than to spend hours on saturday night jostling with
free and happy people to stop them acting on their natural inclination to
have a party.

I'm not going to presume to suggest anything for anyone else to think or
do about this. Do whatever you want, I will. I'll only say this:

Nothing changes by itself.

Hello you wonderful sfravers,

	I was wondering if any of you know anyone or are willing to 
sell/trade any new or old breakbeaty-acidy-trancy records. If not 
willing to trade then could you recommend any really good 
breakbeaty-acid records. I simply can't find anything I like!!!! Please 
respond asap, cause I am in need of new music to listen to! :) Thanx!

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Hi to all who I met at vision--the guy whose name escapes me at the moment--
was it Andrew? who had the fish round his waist?  And everybody who I
didn't get to meet, hi to you, too!  The music was top-notch, though a lot
of people were a bit floaty--more hardcore dancing next time!  :)  Everyone
there had such a great attitude, and it was weird for me because it was 
the first rave I went to sober *sheepish grin* (then again, only my 4th rave!)
but I realized then that love is stronger than any drug and that is what makes
these gatherings so special...
Love to everybody,
timothy

maybe senility is creeping in but I don't get it.  isn't it the fact that 
ravers get sterotyped (as drug crazed hooligans or whatever when they 
*know* they are probably the most evolved and *caring* people on the 
planet right now) by a sensation-hungry press?  am I missing something?

but Java Houses are already under fatal attack via the outlawing of the 
only civilised companion to a cup of perfect coffee - a tube of mild
virginia tobacco, carefully inflagrated at one end and then inhaled
luxuriously, no?  peronally I want to open a Smokeasy and sell smartsex
drinks and cappuccinos, and I'm quite convinced that I'm going to have a
shart career as a tobacco smuggler before this lifetime is over.
ohoh, before anyone flames me over smoking I REFUSE TO ENTER A 
CONVERSATION  
HERE IT"S OFF TOPIC, YES, IT'S OFF TOPIC, HONEST!
yes, see you at the next Chemica Sutra - please book in advance as it
looks like we'll sell out.

luv,  fraser

PS just about my favorite scene in just about my favorite movie is in 
Wings o Desire when the "Man" says to the "Angel" who's watching him have 
a coffee at a late nite kiosk outside:  "there's just no way to 
describe to someone like you how a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette on a 
cold night like this really tastes."  I guess, when I die, one of the very 
last memories of this life might not be the great relationship or 
anything but that taste. (NO DISCUSSION OF SMOKING WILL BE ENTERED INTO HERE)

looks like the final battle for the planet has begun - a battle between 2 
competing memes worldwide, one about love & cooperation and the other, 
well, competition and power.

i don't want to say "I/we told you so", but I will say: let's start 
listening to what's being said NOW.

love ya, cap'n.

patience and real power,

Dear All;

	First a tone statement for clarities sake. I'm just really upset
with what's been going on, and what still is, The trigger, is the most
recent unwarrented attack on my person. This post should not be read as a
flame, my sarcassum is an expression of my frustration with feeling
helpless, and is not meant as a personal attack against anyone mentioned in
this letter. We all have our point, tonight I just reached mine, as others 
have as well, and posted how they felt, this is the most healthy thing I 
know I can do, it happened in this forum with people here, so here it 
must be addressed. If these responses had not been made public, and 
someone had not infered publically that I was discrimating against men on 
the list, this post wouldn't be in your mailbox right now. If you need to 
respond, please do it privately, your feeling and thoughts are always 
welcome.

	I wasn't drawing gender conclusions or stating facts, just my
observations/experience, a place I usually speak from, thats all!!!!. As
far as not directly including the wonderful, loving, soft, men on this
list in my statement, please look up the word "some"  in a dictionary, it
means; 1) certain, but unspecified; 2) of indefinite quantity; 3) about;
-pron. indefinite quantity -adv. 1) approximate; 2) [Col.] somewhat; 3)
[Col.] to a great extent -some suf. tending to be. In other words not all,
not all men, SOME, sheezze!!!!!! & sorry. 

	Please do not read more into my posts that is displayed on the
screen in front of you, I have no trouble saying what I think and feel,
and believe me I will communicate it to you with the speed of a USR 14.4 Fax
Modem. I callem like I see em, thats all. If we men don't call each other
on our own shit, theres no hope for any us. Men need to confront men on
these issues, a womyn's voice though always helpful & welcome is not
enough, with reference to "men's issues/shit". Kathryn as a feminist,
which I'm sure you are, I know you have to agree with me on at least this. 

	As far as most of the men on this list, and here in the bay area,
I find them to be much more emotionally intouch, communicative, and into
non-violent non-hurtful conflict resolution than other places I've lived
in this country, again, just my personal observation/experience. I met 
some of the most fantastic father and father fiqures here, men dedicated 
to being against, and unlike the status quo patriarchacal society. So please 
to not infer that I hate or don't like men, or discrimate against them. 
If you felt like I was doing that, I would have liked it if you would have 
privately asked me to clarify. 

	What happened on this list, and what's still happening is nothing
more than a fest of personified male testosterone, that sickenly reminds
of Junior High School, again just MY observation. I'm sick of the personal
attacks, especially unwarrented ones, against me. I may also point out
Kathyrn & Lyle, your not the one being attacked, but to clarify, your
comments, thoughts and feeling are always sincerely welcome, in my box. 

   Warning: the following is a list of the Results of Too Much Testosterone
		Note, list only partial

	1. Abuse
	2. War
	3. Murder
	4. Rape
	5. Death & Desruction
	6. Genocide/Atomic Bombs going off
	7. Hate
	8. Revenge
	9. Torture
	10. Pain
	11. Suffering/Hurt
	12. Trauma
	13. & Discrimation

	Kathryn I see we agree, we are the same men & womyn "capable" of
commiting unspeakable acts, we men just seem to do it more, just an
observation/perseption, NOT A FACT!!!, and also greatness, positivity, and
grace. My handle Brian Darkness, is about just that, dualality, we all
have a dark side, and each day we all make choices, whether or not were
going to hurt our fellow person; some knowingly, some not. For me, I need
to remember that I to am capable of unspeakable acts, that I'm never above
hurting my brother or sister, it keeps me honest and aware, and looking at
my shit. I feel it's a much more comfortable place to be than having to be
right all the time, or out there hurting people to try and prove a point.
It is my believe that non-acknowledgement of this dark side will cause 
you and others a lot of pain and suffering in this life time.

	I feel its time men start looking for other ways to handle
conflict resolution without hurting the another person.  Ok, I'm pissed.
We are all beautiful(non-gender specified), and it saddens me that people
don't see it in themselves, and angers me that they can't or won't see it
in others, and just hurt!!

all right, so this is marginally rave-related it, but yes! i'm posting it 
anyway...i'll be brief...

the s.f. cannabis buyer's club, which provides marijuana to PWAs and 
other people who need it for medical reasons, is under threat from the 
DEA.  that's right, the Feds visited Friday and repurcussions/further 
actions could be serious. at this point the club is temporarily closed.

there will be a rally on monday, april 10th at 1pm at the federal 
building, 450 golden gate.  i urge everyone who is able to attend.  
dennis peron, founder of the club, is a fellow raver (friend and family!) 
and needs our support.

take care,
monicat

lest some who are following this thread think we're merely talking about
some kind of cyclical renaissance thing I'd like to wipe that one off the
board. I've realised for some time now that it's not a cyclical thing. 
it's not even a spiral, which I thought for a decade and a half. these
social waves are in fact fractals.  by that I mean that not only do they
get bigger each time, with similarities inside (a dance craze, a new
positive attitude etc), but the nature of a fractal is that it goes on
growing and growing until suddenly it falls under the influence of what's
called in Chaos Sience a "Strange Attractor" (wrongly named IMHO) WHICH
FINALLY PULLS IT INTO A NEW ORDER ALLTOGETHER. 
in other words these "ante-raising" soial movements are not different 
things.  they're the same thing approaching critical mass.
nor is time something "that goes on and on like bread that you can cut 
anywhere" as McKenna puts it.  Time heads to a point where it moves into 
its next evolutionary dimension.
now you can argue that we can't prove it will happen this time.  but I 
say: if it's not this time it won't be ever.  because, if a wave doen't 
reach critical mass it falls back alltogether.  which admirably sums up 
our position today.  IT HAS TO BE THIS TIME.

Hello,

Over the past year, the house music around here (up North near Oregon) has
gotten significantly better/ more advanced.  It used to be strictly happy
house discoey divas, lots of vocals. However, at the most recent party there
were few vocals, lots of aceeed and tribal rhythms.  Still mostly 120-125
bpm.
 Unfortunately most of the best stuff had very cryptic labels (I'm dreaming
of a "scratchable" CD turntable with an LCD screen with artist and track
names :-) ), but a few tracks that I did notice were:

The Love Tribe - Together   (this did have some vocals)
Marco Polo - A Prayer to the Music  ( I like that name )
Speedy J - [label said "7" but that might be the label name - anyone know?]

Anyone familiar with any of the above?   Are these ancient history in S.F.? 
Cheese Wiz? :-)

 Well , I just bought my first Jungle mix tape today at Ameba. It's by a 
DJ Ocean - the insert graphic is a bunch of gigantic chrome orbs floating
over the ocean. I really like it! They had another Jungle tape that I
didn't like so much , as there was a lot of Jamacian "toasting" on it,
which I'm not much of a fan of. So far , as I'm listening to it, the
DJ Ocean tape keeps the "toasting" to a minimum - much more cool instrumental
stuff in crazy syncopation. 

 This style of music may be the final trigger to get me to update my 
pathetic car stereo system to something that actually has clean(er)
bass below 100HZ. The deep bass is "sane" enough to move your feet 
to , while the crazy syncopation of the midrange/treble tweaks the 
arms and the brain. I can't imagine dancing to this stuff without
the support of a dancable bass pattern.

 I hope more DJs incorporate Jungle into the music played in the main dance
rooms at raves , instead of keeping it seperate or absent.

Yeah! verily! A quite good fish, rot rot rot!
A pink tutu and a fishy-a naughty one, rot rot rot- lemme tell you, I had
so much fun with myself at Vision that I can't say it all, but my lesson
was watching "the cool" be they the older, euro-cool or the 18
yr.snowboarder studs, those who had attitude were severely disturbed by the
fish. Smack it, I say! It's been a naughty little one, rot rot rot! The
rest seemed to -er- handle it well. Or smack it. Some wanted to kiss it,
but it's been SOOOO naughty! Ahh! Smack it!

A marine saw it, and "fished" for it in my tutu, and exclaimed "I'm gonna
quit the marines an' go to college!" I'm a role model! Or, at
Sushi-a-go-go, I'm a Roll model! Yuk yuk, smack it, bow to my lodcodd! It's
been bad, I tell you, whack 'em again! Rot rot rot!

Which proves that if you don't take yerself seriously, you can STILL have a
good time, since the poses and wrinkled brows don't take yer time up, and
there's no need for wasting energy with social status fears. I preferred
the peakers, shamelessly gone, exclaiming" I must think good thoughts!
You're so special! Let's go meet people!"
   Ah, imagine the CIA's despair when they tested this shit on soldiers in
some fox-hole in Georgia: 2 hours later, the sarge returns and the
test-subject privates are in a massage train, shirtless, rolling "hey
sarge, climb on in. You know guys, Sarge really yells at us, but it's cause
he wants us to be good soldiers, man, you really look out for us. Want some
water sarge?" 

I met a record number of military personell, all wanting out. Now I
understand how free thinking pisses off THE MAN.  If ennough people really
feel this, experience the opened doors, whew! We might all have to get
along. Hmm...

But not to thinik this makes a perfect world. At the same party of peace,
jealous friends became miffed when I entered their circle an made friends
with some of them, "well, now our circle is larger! I must make more
firends now, learn new names, relate to more people and consider their
emotions! Oh, the humanity! Stay away from him!" Oh, pish! 

Well, maybe our family has some bickering memebers, not all doors that open
go outdoors, some just go into the loo of the soul. You pick your doors,
folks!

To all those who have made it outside, thanks for the warmth! Let's try an'
leave the doors open open for the rest, they might just come out for a
cig...:)

Lotsa love,
   Milton and the E-Bee....

>From the LA times:
       (The following text was smile-captioned for the humor-impaired :)
  Ernie, the popular sessame st. heart-throb, was reported missing from
Santa Cruz, Ca., after a nite of drug-laden hedonism in an all-nite
dance-orgy popularly referred to as a "rave" by those in the know.
  Wearing his  striped shirt of fame, Ernie dispelled beliefs of his
alleged affair with roomie Bert, through excessive womanizing and  intake
of record amounts of the notorious rave drug, "Ecstacy", leading him into
convulsions that resulted in organizer Greg Sandler having to restrain the
celebrity, tying him to the balcony, shortly before his dissaperance.
  Members of the international terrorist group "Sendero Depressoso" claimed
to have Ernie as their hostage, but the rave "scene", a comune of social
miscreants, has yet to reveal what demands they must meet to have Ernie
returned. A freshly severed ear was found in the mail of one reveler,
Milton, but it has yet to be determined if it truly pertains to the Sesame
st. resident. The E-Bee declined any statements as to the case, but Milton
was interviewed at Vision. The exclusive follows:
  LAT: Milton, when did you find Ernie's ear?
  M: "wow, can I touch that microphone?"
  LAT: Yes,uhm, when did you-
  M:"It's so round! Mark, come touch this! It records sound!Cool, no?"
  LAT: Are you conserned for the safety of Ernie?
  M: "Hmm? Did you see Ernie?"
  LAT: Yes, he was kidnapped last-
  M: "Do you know Ernie? He's real cool.."
  LAT: Have you been snacking!?
  M: "WoW! Is that Tony? Wait here, man"

  Obviously, Milton was severely affected by the shock of finding Ernie's
ear. Jason and Matt of Harmony fronted a crack team of experts, searching
undercover at Vision to find Ernie. After 10 packs of stickers and several
handfulls of gummy worms, their mounting frustration led to desperation,
and Matt got lost in the stalls.
  Members of the Rave Commune have felt that alleged human Captain Yalon of
the SFPD has been less than helpfull at tracking Ernie's captors. He
refused to comment, but at a news conference last week only stated that
"our forensics team believes it may be the ear of a previous victim, Ernie
may simply be missing. He has a history of wandering under a haze of
narcotics."
  Ernie's manager and co-workers claim this unfair and  untrue. "Ernie has
been clean for six months now. He's turned around, man. He wouldn't do
something like this. It's clear the Captain has a hidden agenda, and we
fear that Ernie's witnessing the New Year's bust may have something to do
with it, since Ernie was there, in drag." Bert refused to elaborate,
stating he was at DV8, after Milton refused to lend him a dress for New
Year's.
 The Whining Path still claims responsibility for the kidnapping, and plans
to release pictures of a living-but considerably shaken-Ernie later this
week. This will include a letter by Ernie, asking for cooperation and
asking his friends and fans to stay calm.
  Ethan Miller, club icon and bon vivant, is said to be organizing a
benefit for Ernie, to be televised live world-wide, direct from Richmond
Civic Center, featuring Tracy Lords, Boy George and Wanda Dee. Jeno is
reputed to be booked, although some say that it is actually Christophe with
a baseball hat.
  In the search for Ernie, many hearts stand to be broken. America waits in
tension and fear, shocked that one so loved could be involved in such deep
doo-doo.

dear bryce,

thanks for your very complete account of your interactions with the cops 
at liquid air.  as usual, your calm demeanor and reasoned tones not doubt 
saved the day.

this information you shared is invaluable and those of us who hope to 
throw such outdoor, free events in future are listening up.

my impression from your account is also that perhaps if we just keep it 
up and don't stop doing these underground renegades that eventually the 
police will just leave us to it, with a minimum of hassle.  particularly 
when it's obvious that it's just a group of friends, plus others, having 
a good time and not bothering anybody.  i recall your telling me once 
that often the authorities give you clues as to how you can avoid trouble 
and still get to do what you want.  so your comments about money and 
alcohol and minors are well taken.

well, thanks again!

Fellow sfravers,

Just got an urge to express myself somewhat as thoughts of dancing 
entered my mind.  Still basking in some afterglow after much dancing this 
weekend, and noticing that I'm still very much dancing, as I'm sitting here.

Looking up dancing in the dictionary, one of the definitions says;
rhythmic movement, usually to music.

When not to music, what are we dancing to?
Is there rhythm in silence?

I can feel it, the life beat, pulsing through my body, vibrating all 
around me.

beat: a habitual route

The continued sence of beingness, ever changing and remaining the same.

Thoughts, feelings, sensations all part of the beat.
 
We may change and grow, but our sence of beingness continues.  That sence 
is something we all share, and as we share it we dance.


peter

Dear Larry;

	Just a minor note, being a Test Engineer amonst other things, and 
having done a lot of accoustical/vibrational testing, the ideal perfect 
human ear has a frequency range of 20Hz to 20KHz, frequencies above and 
below that cannot be heard by most people, less the exception of the rare 
musician ,, but I feel put to the acid test, even they couldn't hear 
above or below the accepted range, this due to the amount of noise 
pollution out there that damages and derates that frequency range, plus 
ageing. I'm told the average human is limited to about 60HZ to about 
16Khz, being liberal..

	Another note FM radio is only limited to I think, I don't have my 
FCC stuff handy 50Hz to about 15Khz, I'm more sure of the upper frequency 
limit than the lower one. This is due to the nature of FM(Frequency 
Modulation), where the carrier frquency(the one you tune to on the dial) 
is modulated by the audio frequency. Frequencies above 15Khz are blocked 
to due bandwidth restrictions, FCC politics & outdated believe systems, 
about keeping acient equipment still able to receive signals. Frequecies 
above 15Khz create unwanted harmonics which cause distortion of stations 
close to the one doing the broadcast.

	Of course when dealing with humans, these are only guild lines,
and unless you have a calibrated & traceable to NIST or other accepted
calibration frequency measurement source, you don't know what you have for
sure. Devices that can be rented and are accepted for doing this type of
measurement, by the measurement science community are Hewlett Packard 3562
or 3582 Dynamic Signal Analyser, or a Bruel Kajer Real Time Dynamic Signal
Analyser, these devices are only good from DC(0Hz though the audio range
plus I think 100khz). Hewlett Packard has some minor problem will their
power supply, you usually see the 60Hz AC line spike on the screen, but
this usually can be taken care of by either creating or finding a proper
ground, which can be an ordeal in itself. Anyway good luck. 

	Opps almost forgot, as far as virtual PC based instruments, most 
are not real time, or only limited to a very small bandwidth that is real 
time, or sampling rate. To get a true real time, with a usuable bandwidth 
you must get a UNix Based machine. Another note, in the test engineering 
biz if I was digitally measuring a signal say 20Khz, the recommended 
sampling rate for the signal was usually 10x that. So the sampling 
frequency was at 200Khz. 

	I'm very curious that the max audio sampling rate is only 44kHz, I
think this is a compromise based on storage capicity and the cost of
faster devices, and the limits of the human ear. Because it you sample a
signal which is 20Khz say, and you sampling at a rate 200,000 samples per
second or 200Khz, and your sample takes 2 bytes say, this means you taking
data at the rate of 400kbytes a second, just for the frequency
20,000.000hz absolute, and does not include the frequency 19,999.999hz
absolute...etc, which when you do the math is a lot of fuckin data, for
example the average 3 minute song, with a resolution of 1 hz, with a
sample rate of say 50khz, and say 2 bytes per sample, would lay data down
at a rate of 1,998 MegaBytes per second x 60sec * 3(for 3 minute song),
approximately.  Though I told you can define a true sign wave with just 3
data point which is true, but in FM sythn audio you rarely deal with a
pure sign wave, but a rather extremely complex waveform. I would recommend
an intelligent sampling algorythm which sampled at a rate high enough for
each frequency range appropreiate enough to give you the desired
resolution, while maximize storage capacity. When I was doing this type of
work, we used 1 Giga Byte Plasom Optical Cartrige Read Write Drives, it
was really cool work.

lemme be the first to congratulate my buddy Milton... (big hug!)

Most of the military guys (and there are some on this list) are just super-cool
wonderful people that ended up in the military for many different reasons. 
Some of them wanted to "get outta Wisconsin" or something like that,
None that I ever met joined the military to "kill someone" :) or shit like
that. Yeah.. some of them. sometimes, have a bad-ass attitude but that 
is mostly a defense mechanism because of the way many of us "civilians" 
treat them.  So give them the same huggy welcome that u would give any other floppy hatted, long haired raver :) Hell, a lot of them are even Democrats :)

hugz

I while ago, an audiofile friend of mine gave me a demonstration of the
difference between digital and analog sound.
Playing the same versions of a jazz solo tune, he proved to me that the
analog version has more notes than the digital. What happened was the
sampling rate of digital effectively cut out the highrange, and gave an
aproximation of the inbetween notes. Looking at a sound graph, the digital
showed up as a series of steps, while the harp note on analog showed up as
a continuous oscillation.

A while later, while in an altered and relaxed state, I experienced a
heightened hearing, and found myself listening to the gaps in my cd.
Literally, if you increase your natural hearing by a slight degree (not
uncommon in an altered state) , you can experience the loss of resolution
in digital, or you can mimic this by slowing down the cd itself ( to mimic
the speeding up of your personal sampling rate of reality).

Another thing I've noticed is that some soundsystems at raves, especially
those using digital equipment, often seem to end up with an out of phase
sound. The bpms bouncing off the walls and cancelling out highrange, so
that you lose any semblence of tune, and get  a dull thud thud of negative
aural space that I find exceptionally distressing. I would love to hear any
opinions on this, have others exerienced this?

I have often thought that perhaps DJ's need to include some kind of pilot
light or pilot sound like anything that's not just an on-off or a beat, for
example  wind instrumentation, so as to keep them in tune with reality and
not out of  phase with their audience.

Dear All;

	Yes, our bodies are under the influence of many different rythms, and 
harmonics of those rythms. Some are very quick, while others are slow over 
the period of days and weeks, for example:

	Cerebral Spinal Fuild cirrulates at the rate of 6 - 8 bpm, which 
	causes you skull to actually flex/extent at the same rate. If you
	have a partner and you get very still & quiet, you can actually
	feel this by gentley holding the head, its really cool, and I've
	felt it on clients.  Its more noticeable on children because the
	joints in their skulls haven't calcified yet. 

	Pulse rate for adult men at rest is about 70 - 72 bpm, while 
	womyn are at a rate of 78 - 82 bpm

	Cirrculation rate is about 2 - 3 bpm

	Heart Rate is about 72 bpm

	Menstrual Cycle 27 - 28, but can vary as much as 18 - 40 days

	Respiration rate is 15 - 20 cycles or bpm

	Stomach during digestion shakes at a rate of 60 bpm

Dear All;

	Yes, I'm often disappointed with the lack of concern for the high 
end of the audio spectrum, with rap, techno ...etc There seems to be a 
lot of emphasis of getting that bottomless bass, which I like, but 
everyone has a budget, and I wonder if sometime the high end is 
compromised for the sake of that bottomless bass, just an observation, 
and a ?.

Peace & Love

All digital representations of this kind of information is based on the 
concept that there is actually such a thing as "good enough".  CD's 
sample at 44.1 Khtz, which the Nyquist theorem tells us can represent 
frequencies up to 22khtz.  Usual human hearing drops out at around 
12-15Khtz, while dogs and other animals can routinely hear up to 20 or 
higher.  The argument that "those high frequencies produce resonance
that shows up in lower frequencies" is hot air as the recording equipment 
would have capture those resonances in the lower frequencies while 
recording.  

Now, you talk about "an approximation of in between notes" which is 
something different - that has primarily to do with the bit depth of the 
sample.  CD's sample at 16 bits, which means they can represent 2^16 or 
65536 different levels of amplitude of the wave.  You would have to be 
able to distinguish between those levels of amplitude in a *single* 
sample (1/44 millionth of a second) in order to claim you could hear a 
frequency that CD technology could not represent.

Also not uncommon in an altered state is the ability to have your 
perception of reality altered by your conscious expectations of what that 
reality should be like.  Psychoactives can *not* increase the frequency 
response of your eardrums (though they can help you hear things in a new 
light).

There isn't any correlation between bad sound systems and digital 
equipment that I've ever seen.  It has everything to do with knowing the 
accoustics of the room and balancing (and not overdriving) the right 
parts of the system.  Ethan could probably speak tomes about this.
 
But I'm not a sound engineer nor physicist so believe what you will.

Dear All;

	What we need hear is a pregnant womyn. There is well documented
evidence that some pregnant womyn, have a hightened/expended state of
hearing, naturally. I image this is a left over defense/warning mechinisum
for helping them be more aware of impending danger, like prehisortic times
when we were part of some animals diets. 

Peace & Love & silliness

Dear All;

	Opps forgot, I was wondering that if you have say a signal say at 
21Khz, and its of enough magnitude that in will produce harmonics up and 
down the audio spectrum, that could be picked up by the audion equipment 
and be heard as noise. Just wondering?

	Good comments Brian and David. I'll also like to hear from Sami 
as well, I thing he would have a lot to say about this subject.

Actually, I was trying to figure out why all this has been cc'd to me in 
the first place :)  But I think I can make a brief comment or two.

In answer to your your question, you could probably induce some sub 
harmonics, but I doubt they would sound like noise.  This is *not* like 
undersampling where frequencies below that of the sampled sound are 
generated because the sampling rate is too low.  These "sub harmonics" 
sound like complete crap when played with the original sound.

With regard to what David said about being able to see the interpolated 
steps of the digital waveform, keep in mind that each step you see 
represents 1/44,100th of a second (meaning you have to zoom the scope 
like crazy before it is visible).  So while true that the signal is an 
approximation, its tolerance is far higher than your perception (which is 
the whole point).  And before we get into an analogue/digital debate, 
keep in mind all of the elements between the source material and the 
speakers and how each of these has an effect, in some form or another, on 
the final output.

	Sami

Dear All;

	Also with regard to Nyquist, I image this therory applies to
sinosodial waveforms(please correct me if I'm wrong due to my
non-familiarity with this therory, but most therories are applied to and
for sinosodial waveforms), and should be derated for non-sin/complex
waveforms. 

	Meaning that if Nyquist saids that you can sample a frequency of
interest up to 22kHz, that the highest frequency samplable for a
non-sin/complex waveform would be lower, how much depends on the waveform
and how complex it is, being sampled, I doubt whether the bandwidth would
be decreased by as much as 5Khz - 7Khz, more like 2KHz - 3 Khz. 

	Also, when sampling data for scientific purposes, measuring
unknown signals, I will say it is necessary to sample at a much higher
rate, it just seems that 2x is a little on the low side. But i image as
the $/mega byte of media drops, and faster and faster devices become
cheaper and cheaper, we will see whether or not there is a noticable
difference in what we hear. 

	I wonder with regard to most samplers whether there just doing a
straight sampling at whatever rate, or using it intelligently like I
mentioned earlier. For example if your sampling at 44Khz and your at the
low end, and apply the Nyquist therory/assumtions, your wasting resources,
by sampling to much. At 20Hz with a sampling rate of 44Khz your sampling
at 2200x your frequency of interest. An intelligent algorthym which either
allowed you to set the resolution, or set bands of resolution/s-rate, say
set the sampling rate for 20-200Hz at 400hz, 201-2000hz at 4000hz ...etc
would be a much better use a resources and would proablly net you a higher
overall bandwidth. Of course this adds to the complexity of the hardware
and cost of the device, but lowers the requirements for memory/media which
are also expensive.

I would hazard a guess that at least 95% of the people in the US can't 
tell the difference between 44.1khz sampled sound and analogue sound.

        I have a question about Nyquist which perhaps someone on the list
can answer.  So its a little off topic, but it's not flamage anyway...
And maybe the discussion will clear up a few other people's mystery
about digital sound.

        The idea of Nyquist, if I understand correctly, is that it captures
enough of the signal that a low-pass filter will get the original back.  To
illustrate, draw a couple cycles of sine wave (in your head if you like).  Put
dots at 90, 270, 450, etc degrees...  ie on the peaks.  Connect the dots,
and you have a triangle wave which if low-pass-filtered will look a lot like
the original sine wave.

        But what if the signal phase is moved 90 degrees with respect to the
sampling clock?  Now the dots are at 180, 360, 540, etc....  on the axis!
Connect the dots and you have a "flatline"...  silence.

        OK, now say you have a signal that is, say, 100 Hz less than 1/2
the sampling rate.  The phase will constantly be changing...  flatline to
triangle and back...  at a rate of like 200Hz.  The amplitude of the output
will be varying at this rate...  sort of a moire effect...  Or you could say
you're beating against a harmonic of the sample clock, I guess, sort of.

        Shouldn't this cause problems?  Like a 200Hz buzz (in this case)?

	The only believable loss of 'information' I've ever been able to
hear with CD quality sound (44.1 KHz, as Brian B. mentioned) involved two
recordings of a Mahler symphony (10, I think, can't remember), which were
presented to me as 'proof' by a fellow music student that 'spacial resolution'
(the ablity to pick out where the instruments are, directionwise relative
to the listener) could be compromised by sampling technology. This was 
definitely the case with these two recordings, but it could have just
been mic choice/placement, the room, etc., since the recordings were done in
different places.

There may be something to this though, since I had a demo of a thing called
a 'convolvatron' one year at Sigraph'90, and the guy, (his name was Scott
Forester I think, with Crystal River Engineering?) said that some inaudible 
frequencies (high end) were important in spacial resolution.

But this doesn't hammer digital, one could just up the sampling rate.

-Dave I. (<- there, now you know which one :) 

BTW: The convolvatron allows one to compose music with cartesian coordinates,
a virtual enclosing space and 'q' (as in how spread out or focused the
apparent source of the sound is).

As Larry mentioned, DJ Ocean has a nice jungle tape AND also shows up to
play at Ameba fairly often (he actually likes to play a much wider
repertoire including Plus-8 type techno :), as well as being a mainstay
at the Il Pirata jungle night each Tuesday.  

I've been "flavoring" my sets with jungle for a couple of months now,
and played a little bit of a new Bukem track at Liquid Air as sort of
a bridge between what Alex was playing and what I wanted to spin.  
I don't have enough tracks to really consider myself a "jungle DJ" --
which involves some different spinning techniques than for house and
techno, generally -- but I'm all for bringing in the interesting jungle
sounds and helping dissolve the musical and other barriers that excessive
labeling has caused in our scene.  

btw, I also highly recommend DJ Gamall's jungle tape (also available at
Ameba); he's also on the list here.

into tha future

Umm, I'm worried that I seem to have upset some of you all with some of 
media-sympathetic postings... perhaps I should explain myself as best I can.
See, I kind of like to take a topic and twist it around in my hands and to hold
it up to different lights, to see everything in as many ways that I can. That's
why I tried raving, that's why I subscribed to your guys' list, that's why I
tried e a few weeks ago for the first time.  I think it'sdazzling when everyone
comes together and freely exchanges their ideas and we all try to untangle
the knots of our existence in different ways. Now, this may inevitably result
in some disagreement, but disagreement is okay.  Sometimes it's hard to recon-
cile disagreement with the wonderful, loving, and non-confrontational stance of
rave culture.  If I ever sound belligerent it's not because I'm being hostile,
I'm just stirring the pot of stew, and all the while I'm still smiling.
Remember, though, whenever we discuss anything, we should all try to remember
to always attack the argument and not the person making it.  That's all that
matters.  Love to you all and as someone posted recently, you are all precious.
Pacifiers, lollipops, and shoulder massages to you all,
timothy

To all of you--I just found a great drink that is ideal for ecstasy users.
It's Odwalla's "Mo Beta" fruit drink, which is chock full of betacarotene
and vitamin E--valuable antioxidants which can combat the rare situation where
one's body may react negatively to ecstasy.  With 1000% USRDA of betacarotene
and 400% of vitamin E, it's perfect...(and no, I don't moonlight as an Odwalla
salesman, if there are any cynics out there! :) ).  Given the tragic death
of a raver due to heart failure(?) recently, loading up on antioxidants
before you go raving is easy to do, inexpensive, and could possibly save a life,
I imagine. And it needn't even be via Odwalla; you could just as easily take
some vitamin pills. Hope this tip helps, and of course, as you all learned
in kindergarten (at this point all the little ravers sing in unison) "When we
do ecstasy, we always drink lots n' lots of water, even when we're not thirsty!"
Happy raving,
peace, love, and blueberry blow-pops,
Timothy

Wow, what is going on with these violent actions by police?
It seems to me that rave culture is growing to the point where it is 
sprouting out more and more from the underground.  As this happens, I 
think it is important to somehow communicate and convey more of an 
understanding of the peacefulness and beauty of the raves.

I enjoy the underground scene very much, and hope it continues.  It seems 
that the scene is becoming much larger than an underground scene.  

Unfortunately known attempts of keeping things hidden very often creates 
suspicions, with the idea; if there's nothing wrong with it, why is it 
being hidden.

Also many people fear what they don't understand.  People may associate 
fear with danger, which can cause a fight or flight response.  
Unfortunately this rave in austraila was met with a fight, probably due 
to alot of ignorance.

It seems obvious that education about rave culture is needed.  I know 
this is happening somewhat, but I think it would be really helpful if we 
started thinking more about how to do this.  I'd really like to hear more 
ideas about this.

Things that I've noticed that have been very helpful with educating has 
been the kind of attitude that is conveyed with people who are exposed to 
the scene.  Bryce gave a good example of this with his last interaction with 
the police.  Taking an interest and caring about someone else (respect), 
is more likely to bring that response back.  Be open to others, and they 
will more likely be open to you.

Helping others feel welcome.  I witnessed this at the last sunset party.  
As people walking their dogs asked what was going on, I saw them welcomed 
to come by and see.  The friendly welcome seemed to tranform their 
confusion towards curiosity.  Rather than just walking by, I witnessed some 
staying a while looking like they were enjoying themselves, having the 
opportunity to take in some of the beautiful vibe.

As much as I like the word rave, I think we probably would be better off 
without it in our education process for a while with the above ground.  I 
think our education needs to focus most of all on the events themselves 
more so than words.  Somehow let everyone feel invited.  

How come so many people feel its ok to celebrate the new year.  Is there 
something we can learn from this that might make it more ok for most 
people to celebrate more often.  Is it that the new year is something we 
all can share.  If thats a big part of it, we ravers know that there is 
alot more in our lives than the new year that we ALL can share.

I'd love to hear any ideas, thoughts opinions on this topic.  I really 
don't want to have to hear about violence at raves.

I am mobilizing the Aussies into contacting an attorney to help
start the ball rolling for a class action lawsuit.   Similar to
what happened in SOMA on NYE.

Well,  it wasn't really a fight..  The police just charged into the crowd
who were dancing,   and injured one of the DJ's who tried to protect
one of the ravers.

Well,  I suppose I can refrain from posting bad things,  but I thought
it was important that the SF Scene knew that even down here in a very
lax society,  there is police harrassment.

In your initial report, you told us:

|they were making an anouncement asking the crowd to not let the police get
|anywhere near the turn tables.  [...]   Finally the cops backed off,  and
|the dancing continued.  It was short lived though,  as the cops were staying
|back to re-group.   This time, they charged into the group of happy dancing
|folks, 

Sounds like a fight to me.  The whole incident may have been peaceful if 
the ravers had initially respected the police's authority.  Instead of
dispersing like a TAZ, we played *their* game, rightly or wrongly.

Peter asks:

I'm more in favor of keeping our own house in order, eschewing with the
ego laden approach of having to show the world how "right" we are - that
chest-thumping, us vs. them, your-way-is-wrong message.  Or does our 
culture, like all western power structures, require a common enemy to 
unite against?   If so, then we've morally and spiritually sold out.

Our true power will be the positive influence we have on people who  
participate in the ecstatic dance culture, and on our ability to continue
having such parties, peacefully and in harmony with *all* the forces that
make up our world.     

That said, I certainly hope the aboveground party brokers win the legal
battles in which our mainstream-defined rights have been violated.  
Meanwhile, our scene, and more parties, legal and otherwise, continue...

Dear Sfravers,

The bigger picture is emerging. These are not isolated incidents, but a
trend WORLDWIDE.
In the UNITED KINGDOM where no bill of rights or written consitution
exists, raves have simply been for all intents and purposes outlawed. Rave
Music itself has recieved specific attention and we all know about the CJA
which defines it as "music with a repetative beat". New Years eve in New
York was NO DIFFERENT from that experienced in San Francisco. Heaven got
busted just like Visual Aid. The problem is this - we are all seeing this
as a local problem. WRONG - it is global, it is comming from up high, and
its aim is to STOP any attempt to hold free, popular, uncontrolled, public
meetings of youth.

In the fifties, Rock n Roll was in the same situation. Mass burning of
records and vilification of rock musicians was the order of the day. BUT
aided by PIRATE RADIO, groups like the rolling stones and the beatles
achieved mass acclaim and acceptance until 1968 and the Summer of Love.
When the entire generation broke out in a wave of love, which to everyones
dismay was eventually crushed by police aided by agents provecateurs,
heroin and speed. If we recall our history you will see that this time was
the first that the ENTIRE WORLD SYSTEM seriously came under question. A
populist evolution very nearly succeeded in dethroning the government and
the war generation itself.

As can be expected, the standing orders of the establishment to this day
are to prevent at all costs
outbreaks of LOVE.  Rock n Roll is now a carefully controlled mechanism for
releasing youthful frustration and making a fuck load of money at the same
time (not to mention selling a load of smack). But as the saying goes, you
can control some of the people for some of the time, but you can't control
all the people all the time. Which is precisely why RAVE has emerged as OUR
NEXT BEST HOPE in getting unbridled LOVE out into the streets and proving
us humans worthy of planetary government.

It is clear what our political goals should be:

TO extend the highest rights guaranteed in the US constitution and the
United Nations Declaration on Human rights - for life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, to all members of our society, and that includes
ravers, as well as all citizens of this world.

WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT of what is painfully clear - the time has come for
democracy to be extended to the highest political structure of this planet
- the UNITED NATIONS.

We can no longer accept the presence of an elite SECURITY COUNCIL of five
nations having a VETO vote over every other nation on this planet, backed
up by atomic weapons.

After 50 YEARS of a post war solution to world governance, the time has
come to open the debate on HOW we are to RUN this planet for the NEXT
FIFTY.

THE PRESENT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK - We must rid ourselves of territorial and
colonial competition and recognise what the business & and internet
community already knows - nation states have already become redundent.

The foreign exchange markets alone have a bigger per day trade (in excess
of a trillion dollars) than the entire US budget.

IF WE REMAIN SILENT, the emergence of planetary bodies beholden to no one,
is assured.

LIKE THE PHILOSOPHERS of old, we must take the next step in evolution OURSELVES.

Like some great NARRATIVE, the rave community, this small family of
happiness beings, has been shouldered with the responsibility that our
LEADERS have already rejected.

RIGHTFULLY WE CAN DEMAND TO KNOW WHY THERE IS NO POLITICAL STRUCTURE on the
planet today, that has as its ideals, the extension of basic fundemental
human rights to the rest of the planet - rights like the freedom to dance
whenever and wherever the whim takes us.

THEY HAVE LIED TO US:  24 hours after NATO and US Commander-in-Chief Bill
Clinton authorised the invasion of IRAQ by 35 000 Turkish TROOPS two weeks
ago, the story is still NOT ON THE FRONT PAGE!

ONE WEEK after the de facto collapse of all financial control mechanisms
regulating the dollar, the STORY DISAPPEARS. While Foreign newspapers carry
reports like the following:

"There appeared to be little intervention from the US Federal Reserve -
 something traders attributed to limited foreign reserves because of the
 Mexican Bailout. In Tokyo, the Japanese government braced itself for the
 damage from a high yen. Continued intervention by Japan's central bank,
 which was reported to have intervened in bursts buying US Dollars
 totalling a massive $2 billion, did little to alleviate the situation."

"...investors scrambled into so-called safe-haven harder currencies in the
wake of the Mexican
 financial crisis, the collapse of Barings and concerns over the massive US
 trade deficit.  In the past week alone, the dollar has declined more than
 6 percent against the mark, and 9,6 percent since February."

 "Analysts said central banks were powerless to restore stability because
 of the huge sums of money in foreign exchange markets - in excess of $1
 trillion a day."

WHILE IT IS UNCLEAR, just exactly what will happen, what we do know is this
- THE SYSTEM IS OUT OF CONTROL.
COMPUTERISED Trading has taken on a semblence of cellular automata and
Artificial-life has hit the financial markets. Not even the Rocket
Scientists know what will happen next.

BUT NO NEED TO PANIC - alternative models for governing the world have been
discussed (and tested) for decades.
NOW IS THE TIME TO COME FORWARD - it is we - the rave pangeneration - who
have the skills and knowledge to move the crumbling system over to a
non-violent, non-racial, life-affirming community perspective.

IF we make known our goals, SOON WE WILL BE GETTING CALLS from those
presently in power positions who need our help.  But this can only happen
if we COME OUT with our plans and visions.

SUMMER OF LOVE PART ONE 1968 awoke this planet to the possiblity of LOVE

SUMMER OF LOVE - THE NEXT MILLENNIUM is where we get back on track. for the
RE-UNITED NATIONS - GATHERING OF ALL THE TRIBES - ravers, rainbows,
zippies, cyberpunks, indigenous councils, all nations that desire life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

This could be true but it isd still a local problem. It has a lot of
subtle corners and edges that you guys who just dropped in are totally
un aware of.

Ummm, the summer of Love was in 1967.  The "death of Hippie" was in 1966
1968 was when the rest of the world discovered what a "hippie" was but
it was the after schock not the event.

Some might say that the war generation was dethrones at least a little bit,

More Action, less talk here... do something....

[the comments are not mine]


I wrote to the Gorbachev Foundation and they sent me a packet of their 
activities and objectives etc.  One of the sections contains information 
concerning the STATE OF THE WORLD FORUM.  This will be held in San 
Fransisco September 28 - October 1, 1995.  I thought that I would relay 
some of the info they sent FYI.

I would appreciate your comments.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Myself and a friend (Brian "Dessert" Topping) are going to visit another
friend in Portland this weekend and will be at Wicked.  Our friend Ed, who
has opened his house up to all who need a place to crash, is putting us up.

Anyway, if anyone from SF is going up, maybe we can all gather beforehand
and go in together; it would be nice to enter as a group.  If not, I still
wish we had an identifying badge (piece of clothing) to recognize one
another by.  (I personally feel we should all shave our heads, but I'm bias
to that extreme.)

I heard there is a large contingency from Vancouver coming down to
Portland.  Can anyone up there confirm this?  (Carebear!?)

Zounds!  Sounds like a good party brewing!  :^}

Feel free to e-mail me if you are going, and/or need a place to stay.  Hope
to see some of you there!  If not, we'll send your love to the Wicked
crew...

Clearing the runway for takeoff,

Tony

Subject: Digital Sound....
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

The other thing to remember about digital sound is that ultimately all
sound is analog -- waveforms propagating through space to your ear. What
this means is that even musical information that is *stored* digitally must
undergo a digital -> analog conversion prior to reaching your ears. And in
fact, discounting feature sets (bells and whistles) this -- the 'quality'
of the DAC chip -- is what really distinguishes CD players (DATs etc.) from
one another (or so I'm told...)

Go into an electronics store sometime and make a comparison of CD players;
you'll be amazed at how different they sound. Sony for instance, uses the
same DAC in all their players so it is the features that differentiate
price. Nakamichi and Onkyo on the other hand scale price in relation to
both the DAC and the feature set.

So to me value of a digital source is mainly the lack of media noise, ie.
tape hiss or vinyl static noise. Though uncompressed vinyl with a great
noise gate is pretty damn awesome :)

Another thing to remember about CDs is that *loads* of them are mastered
from analog and often not very well in relation to both elimination of
noise in the master and in the quality and oversight of the analog ->
digital conversion.

As far as sound at parties goes, IMO, the single biggest factor affecting
quality of sound is the *room*, next being placement of the speakers within
the room and in relation to each other, the absolute key being, no matter
what the size (or shape) of the room, make sure the speakers are working
*with* and reinforcing each other.

A while back I created a visual model for this and learned from it that
given a speaker inclination of 45 degrees (which was clearly the best
choice after graphing all angles from 0 - 50), there is a critical distance
from one stack to another which exists in (relatively) direct proportion to
the power of the amp/speaker pair. Thus with speakers at 45 degrees, at w
feet apart, x watts per side will result in y db over z sq feet.

Increasing w with x remaining constant, results in an increase of z at the
expense of y.

Increasing w and x (proportionally) keeps y constant and increases z

Increasing w and x (disproportionally in favor of x) increases both y and z

Etc. Unfortunately, the math is not nearly as straightforward as it might
seem (there's some weird logarithmic transformm hidden somewhere;), and
indeed, is well beyond me...

take it easy

Just until this too sufficiently annoys those with power enough to pressure
some Senator-wanna-be-reelected-needs-bucks-to-do-so Exxon to introduce 
some bill to criminalize the handling of subversive messages on
communication channels offered for hire.

Wanna operate a car - get a license.
Wanna operate a transmitter - get a license.

P.S.: I think this whole Ernie deal is a hoax. I think Ernie took one too
many "happy pills" and cut his ear off while shavin' (yeah, Ernie CAN grow a
beard, he's older than most of us). Instead of pulling off that "crazy artist"
 deal, he decided to send his ear wit' some nutty note sayin' he's been
kidnapped (to avoid humiliation of cuttin' off his own damn ear).
     Or.....he could of been taken by aliens.

Actually, Exon is retiring after this year.  He won't even have to face

In his press release, he cited "Polarization of the electorate." as one
of his reasons for calling it quits. Guess who was complaining ... :) 

Pressler and Gorton are still alive and kicking though. 

S314 has morphed into an addition to the comprehensive package referred to
as the 1995 Telecom Deregulation Act (among the monikers I've seen).
There's lots of stuff in there, some good, some bad.

As of Friday, it had not reached the floor of the Senate. 
I was on the phone with one of Diane Feinstein's staff last Friday about 
a different amendment to this legislation called the Snowe/Rockefeller 
amendment, which is actually positive. It calls for having telecoms and
net access providers set aside some 'at cost' bandwidth for schools and
libraries.

Talk ta' yer senators! D.F.'s staff is very polite, and I know B.Boxer is
cool 'cause I saw her at an Art Farmer gig!

The main phone number for the Senate is 202/224-3121  It's cool to have
someone pick up the phone and say, "Hello, the Capitol".

no, it wasn't - not in the newspapers except on page 7 or so.  if my

and why do you say the truth was that the US stood aside whenan

I'm actually just on my way to dinner with a bunch of albeit alternative 
politico types who are interested in connecting to RC to bring in some more 
young people.  and I found this in london too - all these "do-good" orgs 
are full of well meaning middleaged middleclass people who are *dying* to 
get some young people involved. we used to give them stalls at

I believe it was on the NY times front page. Page 7 ain't bad for here :)

The IRAQI embargo is costing Turkey money. It decided to say "screw the US" and
go in (I'm not opining on whether that was a good idea :)
And this semi-intelligent (I got three live brain cells :) KNOWS that
they did it on their own.. without help from US. The US really stood aside..
they didnt know what else to do since they had said for eons that the Kurds were
an internal Turkish problem (invading from Iraq)... just like Chechnya..
the US (rightly or wrongly) said that that problem was an internal one also.
Also.. I get the sense that you also mean that Turkey wouldnt have the balls
to attack northern Iraq.. who's to stop him?

> c'mon, brian, wake up.  who reads the Wall ST Journal except the people

hmm... Im awake :) and I read the Wall St Journal.. and I don't know what
game I'm involved in. Nuts.. I sure hope Im havin fun....and Im sober..shit!
The point david made was that the papers hid the story.
Is this a liberal game?  'cos the WSJ is conservative rag.... So the liberal
SF Chron is hiding it and the conservative one is printing it? gimme a break
Fraser. It didn't make the Enquirer either... does that tell you anything?
Something about "knowing your customer base" ?

No, I do not :) This sounds like any old conspiracy theory... just 'cos it 
sounds like Orwell.. doesn't make it real!

some kid with an MBA in marketing that figured that the average joe
wasn't interested in that type of story. The point is Fraser.. it was 
old news.. the Fed intervenes/or stays out of the market *every* day.
No biggee.  You sound like *you* feel that you were deprived of this
news because it wasn't on the Chron's front page. If you really were interested 
there was NO shortage of details on the Feds ability or lack thereof 
to shore up the dollar.. in many papers..that's if you were REALLY interested :)

Except for the uncomfortable fact that Bill Clinton gave verbal support for
the move, and Turkey just happens to be a member of NATO. Methinks that the
difference between AMERICAN and TURKISH troops is just an apple pie and a
couple of hershey bars. And why not conduct nato military exercises in IRAQ
with live ammo. But I shudder when I  see the possiblity for a broad
KURDISH/ISLAMIC/BOSNIAN/MACEDONIAN conflict started by lack of leadership
in the US.

Dunno, the press called it "black sunday" when British Finance minister
Norman Lamont lost 6 billion pounds of the UK's foreign reserves in a bad
gamble that saw the pound drop by a dollar or two. Here they call it
business as usual when Greenspan does the same thing with the dollar, yep,
last monday. Now dollar has reached all time low against the yen and my
prediction is it will continue to slide.

Thing is if you look at the figures, the DOW and the NYSE, wall street is
Crashing and Booming about 5 times a week in an out of control fractalling.


Now, I'm not trying to stear this forum off topic again, its just that if
we want to understand why the authorities may be clamping down on RAVEs
worldwide, then we just have to look at what situation  those in control,
find themselves in - DESPERATION. And if people are desperate, they are
usually dangerous.

And its not just Rave thats getting shafted as the recent article on HIP
HOP censorship indicates in the SF WEEKLY

And I find it curious that in Berkeley, a predominantly student community,
there are'nt parties on every block on weekends. Its even quiet by
Californian standards.

Welcome in advance to everyone who's coming!  I hear rumors a site has
been chosen and it is BIG, and I think we'll need it!!

Tickets are still available at Platinum Records in advance for $13,
but they tell me they'll probably sell out before the weekend.
115 SW Ash, 503/222-9166.

I think it would be cool to have a pre-gathering here in Portland too,
but logistically it may be difficult to put together and also I know a
lot of people from out of town will be arriving later on Saturday evening.

However, if there's interest I'll suggest a gathering point.

see you in the NEAR future!@

This is not perfectly rave related but I need to start this here.

As some of you know I have had, for about two months or so, had a
perfectly good oppertunity to move from Sacramento to the bay area. I've
lived in Sac my whole life but am very familar with San Fran. Because
I've never needed to look for a place to live there, nor did I ever
think I would. This chance for me to do this may not last long. I have a
chance to be an assi. mang. for a bay area music and pro audio store.
This chance won't last too much longer and so I must grasp it as soon as
poss.

The help I'm asking is for ideas as to where to live. I would prefer
Berkeley/Richmond or somewhere on that side of the bay bridge. This is
not a for sure decision but I need to make sure I'm doing the right
thing for the right reasons.

Fro the sake of bandwidth e-mail me privately!

dm12, 2 slight apologies.  1. I've slashed around a bit in your thoughts
here - it's not because I don't *like* you, it's just the Rob Roy way they
taught me to present the cut and thrust of Fine Argumente. 2.  I've been
"following" some of these "extra system psychology"thoughts for decades
now.  when you first hear them they can easily sound like some adolesent
rebellion stuff, certainly unthought out, and possibly even on the edge of
sanity.  all I can tell you is that, as Arena magazine said recently, my
"reputation as a prophet is actually quite good." so don't expect to 
agree with me, but try not to reject me just because you don't agree 
with me  >:-)

good point. imagine if the alernative scene was the dominant culture and
ran the press: the McNamara confession would be front page for days, with
condemnations from the opposition rabble and in-depth analysis and history

the Queen herself is bankrupt?  FERGY PAWNS CROWN JEWELS   no, don't think it

miscommunication. I was rejecting the idea that the US stood down in favor
of david's version that the US had *encouraged* the Turkish invasion
(quite possibly to hide the global economic debacle presently impending). 
I was more than tending towards the encouragement scenario, making the US
stand-aside the *minimum* involvement. as you say, in agreement with this:
"no one worries because Turkey is Nato".  but I'll happily abandon Turkey,
it's not the main point.

no, didn't mean to downplay Turkey's balls, no worries.

miscommunication mostly.  I was poopooing ed's claim that, because they
were covered in the WSJ, they had therefore been "well covered". which is
patently untrue.  would you describe that WSJ coverage plus page 7 in the
Chronicle (which I devour (what litle meat I can find) most days) as 
"likely to produce an elightened informed public."?  didn't think so.. 

I also pick the WSJ etc from garbacge cans as I pass but I'd estimate 100%
of the WSJ's *daily* readership is on one level or another "involved in
the Game".  nor am I saying it's a bad paper, it's often the *only* place
to get information. 

as for stockbrokers, they are the very last people on earth who will tell
you the system is melting down and deserves to.  now please nobody write
in and tell me they know some very nice stockbrokers because all I'm
saying is that they're *never* gonna blow away their entire raison d'etre
until they're forced to exchange the dolloar in their pocket for a piece
of toilet paper.  then they'll probably confess tht they always felt it at
the back of their minds that there was something basically rotten at the
basis of that whole system now gone.

[scam or not is going too far for me] 
this is one of the most frequent misunderstandings in modern 
conversations.  confusing two quite separate questions.  first: how
*should* a sane and civilised society operate?  two: how shall we operate
during the Struggle to get to that new society?  you might believe money
should be done away with, but you might very well decide to use money to
bring about that change.  in other words:  when a system like todays is
actully strangling us and our planet 'tis not the season of singing the
reassuring delights of the status quo!

and nobody's been allowed (or understood) to talk about some of the 
Gigantic Ramifications that might have already started.  let alone some 
imput from others quite outside the system. (witty, educated and

what I'm saying is that a whole class of appartchiks has a stake in the 
Game and they're not going to report it objectively if it's going to make 
their own economic situation more insecure than god knows it already is!

you sorta missing my point, brian. it's got nothing to do with wherther 
*I*'m interested (I'm FUCKING interested all right) it's got to do with 
whether the citizenry of tis democracy is getting an accurate picture of 
what's of great *interest* to them. and, without straying too far 
off-topic I just don't buy the assumption over here that people wouldn';t 
be interested - not if they realised how important it was going to be for 
them, because it is.  they're not going to ollect their isurance 
policies, the money in their acounts is going to melt away like snow - 
still don't think they'll be interested, naw?

actually this all boils down to this: you're mistaking as cyclical what

Hey you guys,   check this out....This is from Grant...

        <snip>

You know, this is the kind of reporting that *really* frightens me about
the power of the press to miss-inform. Imagine a few reports like this in
the general papers & television reports PLUS a few more officials stating
that "we need better laws to stop this stuff", next thing you know, POW,
Australia has its own CJB and we're in the shit with the general public
convinced that raves are dangerous things that will destroy their children.

It's interesting just how much the public can be brainwashed while thinking
that they're receiving unbiased, balanced reporting. A note was posted to a
list I'm on from back during the Gulf War where a research company
tele-marketed a stack of people regarding why America was in the war, how
it started, etc. No one knew the "real" reasons, no one knew that the US
had ignored the situation until its effect on oil became apparent.
Basically the
y only knew what had been pushed on CNN, that America was
stepping in to aid a weaker "ally" and that the Patriot missle was a "real
cool thing".

Maybe the press in Australia and the US is not as controlled as other
places in the world but we're fucking kidding ourselves if we believe that
television stations and newspapers do not have SOME form of bias on ANY
event ( which NewsCorp held publication wants to run a report slamming
Murdock, huh? :).

Jeremy Laurance says...

Hi All,

The cops have a lot to answer for. With all this shit going down I haven't
been able to make it to the gym all week. :)

Ok, I get the feeling that Police Internal Affairs have decided on
their strategy to bury^H^H^H^Hinvestigate this whole thing,
so hassling them any more won't get any response except more
misinformation coming back. Thanks go to everyone who phoned them.

There seem to be two issues on-going here (apologies for stating the
bleeding obvious):
1. Response to the naughty things the cops did on Saturday night.
2. Countering mis-information about the rave scene in general.
   Making sure our point of view gets accross to the legislators
   at least as loudly as as the cops' and councils'.

The most constructive next step on (1) is, IMHO, is to make sure
the State Ombudsman's office devotes as much resources
to their investigation as possible. After all, these people
are trained in getting meaningful information from the cops
and other minor miracles.

If you were at Freequency and didn't like what you saw,
make a complaint! This is important. Encourage your non-netted
friends to do this as well.

The worst that could happen is for someone to make it to a rave and NOT be

>From the Miami Herald:

Reports have come in that Ernie was released from captivity, but is now
fleeing the DEA and said to have been captured by Interpol while hiding in
Argentina.

The Sendero depresosso claimed to have released Ernie, this Tuesday, but it
is believed he may have actually escaped during delivery of fresh linen at
the hotel where the terrorist group was reputed to be hiding. The Whining
Path has yet to comment, but a radical splinter group, the Sittin' Fine,
claimed to have Ernie in custody. All these reports proved to be false as
photographs of Ernie in the LA international airport were shown on
Nightlie, tuesday nite.

14 hours after boarding Air-gentina flight 107, Interpol agents stormed the
plane as it landed in Bueno Aires this morning, serving  a warrant for
possesion of sundry amphetamines and  smuggling of acid to Germany and the
UK last spring. Ernie was briefly detained, but Argentine officials refused
to allow his deportation.

The DEA has also requested Ernie's extradition, due to recent comments by a
miffed Bert and recent e-mail recoverd by DEA hackers after seizure of Big
Bird's computer at a NY bust this winter. While only requesting his
presence for questioning, Ernie's lawyers have reccommended the celelebrity
remain in Argentina for the next few weeks.

Argentine President Menem reputedly found Ernie to be a fellow womanizer,
tooter and tripper,according to a close aide, and both appeared in public
this morning, on their way to Victor's Floating Casino on the La Plata
river.

Shooting of episodes for Sesame St. are currenty going on, with splicing of
old anecdotes involving Ernie. Tonight, he is expected to hold a press
conference in the Brazilian border town of Amizade as the floating casino
pulls into port. President Menem has stated that he will not bow to
international pressure to defend laws that he feels are unjust. "Americans
need to cut loose, mijos. Lookit Ernie, he's a good enough chap, he's done
no harm.  Why can't they just go after the real criminals, I mean, the US
and Intepol never came after all those old Nazis here, and Mengele,
whuddabout him? Eh? Sheesh"

Ernie seemed well, and apparently in possession of  both ears. His lawyers
are currently working on his safe, legal return to the states, but in the
meantime, fans can only hope for this to be the end of Ernie's ordeals.

Greetings all,

Just to let you know about an upcoming party Mother Earth Sound System is 
doing, in celebration of Earth Day, spring, and rebirth!

KIVA

Saturday, April 22

Mother Earth Sound System DJs
Dubtribe
Tony

415.487.7681
510.549.6260

A traditional kiva is an underground ceremonial chamber whose structure 
is symbolic of spiritual emergence. The Hopi people believe that whatever 
transpires within the kiva has a direct bearing on the world at large. 
The songs and dances performed within the kiva ensure the continued 
blessings of our Earth Mother and other universal forces. They remind the 
participants of the Road of Life leading to peaceful coexistence in 
brotherhood with fellow man and all living spirits.


Respect to all,

			MOTHER EARTH SOUND SYSTEM

just run this thread parallel to the thread about the Ozzie raid and anti 
rave propaganda and that gives some insight into our slightly longer term 
strategy.  OK?  fraser

Subject: Re:  This Week's SFR Calendar

   My son Morgan Jones, a sophomore at the University of California
at Santa Cruz, died on April 1, 1995, after attending a rave in 
San Francisco.

   The coroner has not yet issued a death certificate, but 
preliminary indications we have from a private autopsy are that he had
ingested a small amount of Ecstasy and a small amount of alcohol.
The Ecstasy may have induced a heart arrhythmia which killed him.

   It is my impression that young people regard Ecstasy as an
essentially benign drug.  They should think hard before taking it.

   I am not yet well informed about the drug, but will be researching
it in the months to come.  I would be happy to hear from anyone who
can help me in my research.

   There will be a memorial service for Morgan in the Stanford
Church, Sunday, April 30, at 1:00 p.m., with a reception following
at his grandmother's house on the Stanford Campus.

http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~drenalin/knowledge.html
we are trying to get a lot of current info up there as well as
inspirational things so please check it out but more importantly if you
have good info like petitions or press releases that could be useful on the
web send them to us via my edress and we'll try to get them on the web
within a couple days!!  Eventually we might look for people who are
experienced writers and activists to write letters for us to publish to the
web and make it easy for people to send letters to politicians and the
like...anyway email me back privately if you have stuff!

This bounced as it included the word "svbscribe" in it, with the v 
changed to a u, which I filter for in an attempt to capture people 
unfamiliar with how to add or remove themselves from a mailing list.

To answer your question before you get a chance to ask it, Phred (bad 
form  I know :) I don't want to start a mailing list whose mission 
statement is "everything only remotely tangentially related to the 
discussions that happen on sfraves".  Even I wouldn't svbscribe to that.  
I would sooner make SFRaves a moderated mailing list.

However, I understand best.com allows one to set up majordomo-ized 
mailing lists - David Dei and/or Fraser might find that useful.

In the future, of course, we'll have collaborative filtering, and posts 
of interest to only a few will die by evolutionary forces....

I think we should request that Brian start a new list called sfraves-talk.
Getting postings running to 10K or more which have very little to do 
directly with "sfraves" is getting tiresome to say the least.  I am all
for people on the list here discussing the important issues of the day,
but quite frankly I subscribe and contribute here on the basis of wanting
to be involved with "sfraves".

Thank you.

Us lot from S.P.A.Z. are thinking about doing a Summer tour and while we 
do have some contacts, particually in the mid West, we are not doing so 
well past the Central parts of the country.  Does anyone have any mailing 
addresses for rave networks in that part of the country or any where else 
for that matter.  More contacts we have the more shows we will be able to 
play and the bigger it will be.  Also anyone interested in coming with us 
should either call the S.P.A.Z. voice mail or send e-mail to the above 
address.
Thanks for your help, Tristan (NOT Kevin; although he'll be on tour as 
well!).


P.S.  Angry old man wants to know who he can slagg-off this week.  Got any 
suggestions?

phred, maybe you should instead say :

"I think we should request that Brian refrain from answering non-rave related
posts greater than 5K as his "pain in the ass" verbosity is prone to double that
size in response."

I did not start that thread, phred...hmm that rhymes...:)
Nor have I ever started a political thread such as that (as far as I can rem). 
However, I gotta confess to a need to respond, sometimes point by point, 
to some of these threads. If you would like that I refrain from that.. I 
certainly could.. and I hope you do also.. as I seem to have seen you and
Fraser/David in open non-rave related quite a lot recently :)
Reminds me a little of the kettle and the pot being equally black!

phread.. my *humblest* of apologies. 

I sent u a post basically saying that if
u quit responding to these political posts I will.. 

I assumed, incorrectly, since I seemed to be the last "political" post
that the Brian above referred to me. Since it didn't, I promise *NEVER* to
respond to a political post again! honest injun! :)

sincerely

Hi Folks,

I am going to be taking off for my long awaited vacation in about a month
and was wondering if anyone could give me a pointer on how to find
out about the rave scene in Frankfurt, Germany.  I thought that I should
sample the scene over there while I am playing tourist.

Thanks in advance, big hug and kiss,

Ron.

check out the dorian gray. it's below the flughafen but above the zug! 
next to the kino! das ist die discotek fur tekno music gehoren. aber, die 
hauptwache (sp?) ist den 'main strip' fur dieses schallplaten 
und 'rave gear' gebrochten. ich hat zwolf jahre in deustchland 
(frankfurt) gewohnen, und die 'rave scene' im 1988-89 was sehr gut! 
mostly in bomb shelters. cool, huh. there was this one called 'bubblegum' 
underneath the main financial district in the summer of '89 or so.
there's also plenty of record stores under the hauptbanhof, so check 
there for info. the hauptwache is 2 or 3 stops from the hauptbanhof and 
the konstblerwache is one more past that. these are the main shopping and 
strolling areas in frankfurt. should have no prob. finding out anything.

 I recently noticed another post about a death on X ( and alcohol ) and
since TV is showing an expose on deaths caused by using tylenol with alcohol
I was just wanting to mention how we really do need more "information"
in our society on responsible drug use... 
 
  I personally find it "odd" that people feel it is "normal" to take
8 tylenols per day along with 3 drinks PER DAY. From my perspective
unless one has a very serious problem with pain - this pattern of drug
use IS drug abuse. But then I take about 8 aspirin/tylenol or whatever
per Year ! 

  Of course, here I am "preaching to the choir" since it has also been my
experience that some of the most responsible drug users are those that
often take "illegal drugs" - ( and when out of control some of the most
irresponsible also - go figure ). IMHO of course :)

  I just hope that the pain of losing his son will not cause the man who is
going to research X to place all of the blame on this single drug. Especially
when drugs that are perceived to be safe like tylenol can become deadly when
mixed with alcohol. Answers - when they are found - are sometimes grey but
seldom black or white....

Just thinking...

Mike

Does anyone know of any free park raves put on for earth day next week?

I think this might be a good chance to bring the prss in on it! If we
show some of the awareness involved with raving and also the love, We
may be able to start to show our side of the story. We have alot to
show. Must of us probably carpool to a rave!

I try to everyday show my support for earth day. By recycling. By
cleaning up, even if I didn't litter......etc...
I would hope all of you do too. Almost 30 years of celebrating earth day
is only a start. Treat everyday as earth-day!

it seems to me, a mere newcomer to sfraves and absolutely willing to stick
to the local rules, that there are currently two threads that don't seem
to be connecting in everybody's' minds - almost scizophrenically.  

one is about Rave Culture *not* being about politics etc while the second,
mostly from crunchman in ozland, is bringing into the foreground what has
been increasingly seen here in the Bay Area since at least January 1st,
namely the global crackdown on that very RC. 

now more and more sfravers are writing me privately on these matters -
some say that sfraves *should* be about Rave (which doesn't just mean DJs
if any of you Djs think it does - remember we don't want rock'nroll
"stars"  no more if that's your viewpoint) while others seem to accept
that sfraves *is* meant to be about gig times and djs 'n records 'n 
clothes 'n who I hugged there etc and all that. 

some of these latter are suggesting a Cc list or something.  now I don't
really understand all this bandwidth problem (I personally don't care how
long it is, I care how deep it is) (is it the cost to some people of
downloading it?) I have one suggestion, possibly stooopid.  could this Cc
thing be tried and then released onto sfraves, say, every friday, 30000
long but clearly marked "BORING" or "SERIOUS" so that those who don't 
want it can effortlessly avoid it?  any use?  no?  'spected not.

one other thing to do with all this - I'd like to know how people who have
been putting out the "Raving is just about Raving" thread don't feel some
small element of remorse now that they see how *political* it's all
getting ( actually has been but it just wasn't so obvious) I mean, wasn't
it only a few weeks ago some people were telling us it was all my
imagination and raving had *nothing* to do with all that?! obviously some
high up authorities out there don't agree with you.  anybody like to
recant on that one?  because, believe me this time, RC is only going to 
get more and more "political" (as it affects and therefore begins to 
enter the terrain of "ordinary earthbound poitics" whether it wishes 
to or not) and whether you like it or not.  nothin' to do with me, 
guvnor, I'm just reporting historical developments, not making 'em 
happen. (?)

or do you original first threaders (definitely phred who, I just checked,
has been making vaguely negative remarks about this very point since
almost the first appearance of the zippies on the internet last April, and
several others) still not see the connection?  either you deny there's a
gathering national/global crackdown on RC and that all that Criminal
Justice Balls in the UK we were on about last year has *nothing* to do
with Raving in California (do you?) or you don't see that, if it *is* so,
it can only be because authorities less involved in RC see the power of it
better than you do. 

if that's the case I suggest it's for you to look around at the more
political environment and *notice* the increasing connection. in the real
sense of the word "politics" RC is possibly the *most political*
phenomenon on the planet today - it's outside the "old Game", it's
radically life-altering, it encourages people to "come together", thus
empowering themselves and so on.  and the authorities worldwide (who care
deeply about such stuff) are increasingly noticing it even if you don't. 

and one final question, asked because I genuinely do not know the answer. 
is this post a) off subject b) too long?  could all those who have
complained tell me please.

Well,   some interesting events I want to reflect on...  And that is how
similar the rave scenes are between San Francisco and Sydney.  I'm currently
in Melbourne right now.   But two major events took place,  one happened in
San Francisco when a most unfortunate raver passed away,  and the other
event in Sydney when the police got out of hand.    Both events made the
press,  and has given raving some pretty bad press.    It is clear that
we must strive to enlighten the public by informing them of all the good
things about raves.    

In my tracking of BOTH the SF scenes and in Australia,  I've observed this
effort on both sides of this big ocean.    It might be a good idea for each
side to subscribe to each other's mailing list.    I'm on BOTH SFRaves
and AusRaves,  and the messages I'm getting are so similar its almost
uncanny.    

One SFRaver commented...

>Does anyone know of any free park raves put on for earth day next week?

>I think this might be a good chance to bring the press in on it! If we

Also,  in SF,  the SFPD busted up a legally permitted party for an AIDS
benefit organization.    The result of which has generated a class action
lawsuit against the SFPD.    13,000 KM away,  on the other side of the
Pacific,   a similar incident took place.   In both cases,  the press
was involved,   but us ravers seem to have no voice or little opportunity
to tell our story.   

Monica and Tom from SF comment...

For those who don't know it,   triple-j is the Australian national youth radio

On BOTH sidesof the Pacific,  the police are monitoring our Email,  as
I'm getting indications o such...   If that is so,   then this is GREAT
as we have the tools to prevent that -- IE:  PGP.   As the police are
now well aware that WE NOW HAVE UNITY!!  All over the world.   We have
a powerful tool in our hands.   Our mailing lists...   With this,  we
can instantly communicate.   What we need to do,   is to figure out how
we can use this tool to get out to the world what we are all about.   

The WWW is one such powerful tool.    PICTURES are worth a thousand words.
A picture of a Sunset rave with people smiling and having fun,   or
a picture of a Sydney rave with the same smiling people can certainly
help to show the awsome love and energy that goes on at these events.

Already,  efforts are underway to put together WEB pages for the casual
Internet surfer.

Lets use those tools we got....   

Anyway,   for those in Melbourne,   see Ya all at Land of the Giants...
I'll be the older dude wearing my goofy checkered hat.... I'll certainly
have my well publiized mission in mind,   we all know what that is....  :-)

And or those in San Franscisco scene....  PLEASE KEEP THE SCENE ALIVE...
I'll be back soon enough,  raring to pump in my awsome energy into OUR
scene...

Hello,

Well, quality digital sound is more complicated than that.  There are lot of
factors that have been discovered recently that were not known about 10-15
years:

1) The biggest factor both with digital and with analog is the ability of the
electronic components to consistently stay within their nominal value at all
times.   About a year ago, Mike Moffat (sort of the Richard James of digital
engineers) created an analog-to-digital converter using very expensive
military grade components that hold their value in all conditions.  I have a
couple of CDs that used his converter (called "The Gain System") and they
have that warmth and air that you find in analog, but not in digital.

2) Another factor that has gotten a lot of attention recently is "jitter",
which is basically a time smearing that occurs when the various different
electronic components in the digital chain get out of sync.

3) Power supplies are also a factor in consumer-grade digital components.  If
there is one power supply for both digital and analog components, then when
the servo is "hunting" (trying to maintain the spot on the disc) then
momentarily the analog components (and the DAC is well) will be underpowered,
causing a decrease in fidelity.

Another miscellaneous bit of information is while Technics turntables are
excellent for functionality, they are far from the best current turntables
sonically speaking.  Since the 1200's were introduced, materials engineering
has advanced, eliminating a lot of the resonances that color the sound of
earlier tables and tonearms.  And, none of the best phono cartridges have
versions that allow for back cueing. :-)

respect to all,

Raving has always been about many things other than *just* the logistics
of particular parties.  Politics is one.  There are also spiritual,
psychological, technical (ie. sound engineering), sexual and social
aspects to raving.  All these have been discussed on SFRaves since it
was formed.  There is nothing new about the recent political discussions
brought here by you & others.  What's new is this insistance 
you have on making global and national political issues dominate
over all these other interesting and important rave-related topics.

I don't understand why some people cannot fathom the reality that SFraves
is a *regional* list.  BrianB has always allowed us to go off on these
other tangents, but ultimately the main focus here is on more SF-
specific issues.  

I know that both you and David Dei have occasionally posted to alt.raves,
a global Usenet newsgroup that reaches a much wider audience than here.  
Many SFRavers read that newsgroup, too.  Why do you insist on bringing
your global message here instead of there?

Another approach is to have another mailing list that is non-regional.
I bet you can get a greater global participation that is more focused
on politics than alt.rave or any of the regional lists are.  

> or do you original first threaders

Not everyone so readily believes in global conspiracies.  There
have *always* been busts of illegal parties, even before raving.
There is certainly nothing new about predictions of an impending
world apocolypse.  And cultural revolutions?  Considering the track
record of the Industrial, Socailist, and China's Cultural revolution,
I'm glad that there is some skepticism about the "RC" revolution you
seem to be championing.

> and one final question, asked because I genuinely do not know the answer.

There has never been anything wrong about an occasional thread like
this one, as long as it doesn't start dominating the general purpose
and written charter of this list (didn't you read it?).  You have
other *better* options for a more in depth exploration of global 
issues.  If these issues are so important to you, why limit them to
such a tiny forum?  You've already made your point here.  Maybe it's
time to enlighten another regional mailing list?  Just don't tell them
that I sent ya.  :)

  Just thinking this morning about the possible big filmore show and one
important aspect of it ( in my mind at least )...

 Currently there's been much talk about "crackdowns" and negative press
about raves and/or raving - so much so that people have suggested that
we should abandon the word rave itself....

  It seems to me that one way to "educate" people about the positive
aspects of raving/rave culture is to ( on occasion at least ) come out
from the underground and throw a high profile ( perhaps even media 
covered ) event - that hopefully has the positive vibe associated with
F&F. The position is further strengthened if media "stars" give it their
blessings AND participation. 

  While I can understand some people's position that " we don't need no
stinking badges ", I fear that if we remain totally underground and don't
tap into some of the "staus quo", we will perhaps be so separated that the
crackdowns will increase not decrease until perhaps as in the UK raves will
be outlawed...

  It is in this light that I support the idea of a large event at a space
like the filmore and with "media stars" such as ( but not limited to ) 
mickey hart. If we convinced these people and others that what we do is
worthwhile - then the authorities will back off. If we are "friends to none"
in the mainstream structure - then we will have no friends in the 
mainstream. This will leave us with no support when the police or other
authorities come knocking...
 

  On that note, I see events like Sunset where people actually see the 
positive vibe as "they walk the dog" or whatever does much to educate the
uninformed about the peace and positivity associated with raving. People
need to SEE positive examples of rave culture not read about its "underbelly"
in their local newspaper....

Ummm Fraser, may I suggest that you download the sfraves archives
(if you don't know how, I'm sure someone can help you) and read them
(or at least browse them) from start to finish.  Then you will see the ground
that has been covered over the last few years and you might undrstand
some of the reactions that you are getting.

Both themes can and have peacefully co-existed on the same list I think
the flack that you are getting is more from your presentation, fine
there is a global crack down on Raves, OK let's say that's true, now
my question to you is what are *you* going to do about it, given that 
you have this realization.  I don't want to here what *we* should do
I want to hear what *you* are going to do, and then maybe I'll deceide
to _join_ you or maybe support you or do something else entirely.

Fraser if you don't understand these types of issues it is your
civic duty to ask someone to explain it to you, otherwise you are
being very inconsiderate of your net brothers and sisters and that
I think you would agree is a very "un ravey" position to be in.  Some people
have to pay per message but in general hypperreal the little "virtual
reality engine :)" that generates this part of cyberspace is small, is
maintained on a volunteer basis, and is given bandwidth by the good graces
of WiReD magazine.  It's a stupid bird that shits in his own nest.

Well I'm not going to speak for phred because he does it just fine by himself.
If you read my posts over the last few years I think you will find
that I've believed that there was a global house movement.  I don't have a 
problem with the political nature of raving, what I have a problem with is
the way that you and other people conduct your political lives and bring the
heat down on others.  You forget where you are, this is San Franciscc and this
whole thing from the 60 through the 90's has been raging here and in our
politics for the last 30 years.  Bear in mind that there is a strong psychedelic
community here, many have gone and still are political prisoners held
in some pretty bad federal pens for the distribution of LSD.  LSD and other
psychedelics that supposedly are manufactured here are a major threat
to the State, at least they act like it is.  The DEA has been trying to
crack thisEgg for decades but they can't do it because the Family is really 
tight and they keep their mouth shut.  Sometimes you have the most amazing 
friends in high places. Some of you on the list know what I'm talking about :)
You guys have come here dragging the media with you, totally insensitive to
what's going on here and are acting like you have all the answers where 
all I can see is that you fucked up your little island and now you want
a second chance here.  Well something like the CJB could happen here but
I believe that RC as you call it is more of an EVOLUTIONARY FORCE as
opposed to a REVOLUTIONARY force.  The battle that must ultimately be
fought is one of not even freedom of speech or freedom of assembly but
of FREEDOM of CONSCIUOUSNESS.

yes, you are right it is outside the "old game" in fact I assert it is
outside the whole political spectrum altogether because the political
spectrum involves us vs. them and RC at least in my opinion is more like
expanding your own consciousness and the ones around you to increasingly
include more and more "us" and less and less "them".

I have one final question for you Fraser,


What can we count on you personally to do about this situation that you
are warning us about over the next few months that you

        First a bit of an introduction, i've been on this list for a bit
and am now coming out of my lurking as i've had an experience recently that
has shed a bit of light on the 'representation of raves.'  I live in
Montreal (hope you don't mind me peeking in on what's going on in SF, i'm
thinking of a move soon) and am on NE-raves where we've had MANY
discussions about the term 'rave' and the crackdowns that have been
happening recently.  A lot of ppl want to abandon the term, others want to
're-appropriate it' in the same way that other cultures (people of colour,
women, gays, lesbians and bi's) have taken back word which (for lack of a
better term) the 'media' has distorted.  I'm unsure as to what the best
idea would be.
        Having a 'high profile party' may be a good way to give ppl FIRST
HAND evidence of the beauty that 'raving' can be.
        Another (and this is my story) would be just to TALK to ppl 'from
the outside' as i had to do the other day in my art class.  A lot of ppl
looked at this (lame) sculpture i did and the topic of raves came up, along
with all the preconceptions (everyone is on drugs, it's superficial, you
have to be 'on something' in order to enjoy it, it's a fad, etc.) and all i
did was speak from my own experience, adding that i rarely do anything
stronger than herbal stimulants and i think that THIS is something that can
change ppls ways of thinking, it's just on a grass roots level.  But, i
guess, that's sort of what 'raving' is doing in the
socio-political-cultural arena ANYWAYS, i know that that is what it did to
me.

        just my .02 cents, thanks for reading :)

                peace,

---------------Original Message---------------
I think it is amazing that the mother who lost her son  has contacted us and I 
hope she will continue to do so. For the record , I do think we have drug 
abuse problems within our community, as do most groups of young people.
On the other hand, I've never seen young people be as kind to each other as I 
have with young ravers. 

I think the "prophets" are wrong. I see neo - alienation (real alienation and 
revolution is no longer possible) replacing peace/love aesthetics (hopefully 
peace/love will remain the undercurrent). The irony of symbolic difference 
and connectivity will be a greater paradox than the "prophets" now realize.
The media will call it a new-wave/punk revival and they will be partially 
right. Rave culture will be further splintered. The "prophets" will be forced 
into hybernation once again.

                          Happy happy! Joy!Joy!

hmm, a free, outdoor party, a collective effort, a party based on love,
built on respect for those who come and bring the vibe, a gathering under
the forces of a new lunar cycle at its peak, could this be true?

Ahh, many of us had a dream. Many of us had hopes and wishes. Now they will
come true. It depends on us, mijos. We must come, we must be there, we must
reclaim for ourselves what was once done for us, we must make it ours
again. 

And then maybe, again, once a month, there will be that special, magical,
renergizing spiritual gathering, free of attitudes, free of cares, just one
massive love permeating every fiber of every soul in that small space
called a rave......

    So arise! Smile! Dance! And do that voodoo that you doo so weeeeelllll!

Gonna be a good one:)
 Lotsa love,
   Milton and the E-Bee......

Since Fraser mentioned me, I simply want to say I stand 100% with what
Geoff White and Lee Fogel replied.  

I don't want to break this down into polar opposites, but let me suggest
that one fundamental difference in perspective is between the confrontational/
revolutionary/rhetorical/triumphalist strategy pursued under the "zippie"
banner, and the much more modest but in many ways more deeply rooted
adapational/transcendant approach epitomized by Hakim Bey's weird but useful
T.A.Z.  

Where this scene connects to my life at a fundamental level is where it
moves beyond the superficial relations of power, authority, response and
resistance to a more diffuse yet more powerful restructuring of relations:
with ourselves, with each other, with our planet.  I do the slam-bang
political thing every day; I'm on the phone today with our Republican
legislature and the Governor's chief advisor to try and save our global
climate change study.  That's all fine and good.  I don't see what I do
in the r**e scene as disconnected from that at all, it's merely operating
on a different but intersecting plane of activity and reality.  I don't
play loud house music in the Oregon state capitol (yet) and I don't want to
divert too much explicit attention from having good gatherings with music
and art and conversation and inner searching and outer reaching to the
problems of the day, as heavy as they may be (yet).  

The Internet, considered as a whole, is a vast experiment in changing how
we communicate and relate to each other.  One of its key features is the
ability, at a very low system cost, to allow for those conversational
modes that people would like to pursue.  It seems to me that is the reason
sfraves started to begin with, and has been so successful and to me at
least so much of a change agent in my life.  But it cannot BE the entire
net, it needs a limited scope.  So logically it seems to me that if there
is interest in the didactic and goal-oriented discussions that Fraser and
others may want, then, as I suggested recently, another discussion list
should be set up.

I've been pretty didactic and preachy myself over the last few weeks,
friends.  I'
ve learned something from these thrashes, but I'm also prepared to leave
them behind and move on.  The willingness to take in what new arrivals to
the list have to say, and consider it and let it challenge our normal
ways of thinking, is good.  It is also good not to let this process become
an endless distraction or even the primary focus of the list.  I am very
happy to see Fraser Clark and David Dei and others who bring in fresh
perspectives here and offer them respect for their views and request that
they "grant slack" and let all voices be heard in their due time.

see you in the future
phred

Sorry the formatting is still screwy.  I've put in a top-level web
page into http://hyperreal.com/raves/sf, so you can get to the calendar
easily from there.  There's also a new map of important sites in SF
now.  

This weekend, all of the parties look pretty cool again (we've been having
a pretty good spring so far); Ex Why Zzz will be the most massive, while
a lot of the others look to be more intimate (esp. Club Freaky, solyluna).
There may be a full moon party (besides sol y luna) too, dunno exactly
when.

*From: Michael E. Clay <meclay@netcom.com>

* Currently there's been much talk about "crackdowns" and negative press
*about raves and/or raving - so much so that people have suggested that
*I fear that if we remain totally underground and don't
*tap into some of the "staus quo", we will perhaps be so separated that the
*crackdowns will increase not decrease until perhaps as in the UK raves will
*be outlawed...

Yes.
I come from a family heavily involved in political discussion (both right 
RIGHT and semi-left(i love them all!!!!)) and have discovered that politics 
become ultimately 
grey and never changing.  You strip people of politics, and you end up 
simply with their personal characters, complex. Public exposure is good and 
the best effort should be put forward, but publicity often dilutes, often
 generalizes.  While simultaneously working to educate "the world" (we are 
music, we are dancing, we are humans, we are life), we should educate the 
individual (the elders to know more, the young kids to think wisely). 
 The best examples i've 
heard so far in breaking out to the "status quo" are Ronan and Galen's 
encounter with the police at the sunset rave, and bryce's encounter at 
Liquid Air. It is the one on one that made a difference. It is the police 
*being* there and talking with them that made a dent.  A lot of small 
dents become....well, you know. Perhaps that is naive, not street-wise, 
but i'm so hopeful....

good luck out from nyc, eugenics

Hello Everyone..:)

	At the last fnf party I attended (the one that got broken up)
I experienced a strange ritual.  A newly acqiured friend of mine,that I 
met at digitaria, introduced to it..I don't know if anyone else has 
experienced this or even heard of it.  Anyway, what the idea was that you 
are supposed to say whatever is on your mind, but not in the usual 
context of speech communication..  Apparently from what I gathered   the 
idea is to verbally express the rythms or thought 
patterns that your brain,soul, heart, or whatever it is inside of us that 
instinctly has rythm in it.  

I guess the easiest way of decsribing what this is that it is a way of 
speaking in tongues
,in a sense,.  Anyhow I found the activity to be a very good release 
method.  At first I was very out of rythm and the patterns that i spoke 
sounded muttled and choppy.  However through a little practice I learned 
to channel this primal form of expression  and have found it quite 
threaputic.

If anyone knows out there what the hell I am talking about please feel 
free to let me know what is up.  Is there an unspoken RC term for this 
ritual or is it simply known to a few people.  Has anybody else out there 
seen this done? I have a feeling that this might be a practice left for the 
more intimate parties...?  Just really curious  .....:)

hugs
Dan

Dear All;

	Regarding Military/Standard Components(MIL/STD), being an 
X-military design engineer of sorts(sub contractor work only), we were 
forced to use components that were tested to the MIL/STD/883 grade. 
Whicjh means to all you cilivians, god bless you all, that the components 
were all tested prior to assembly and after, these components were tested 
in the following ways:

	1. Energized On & OFF
	2. Hi Attitude and Hi Pressure
	3. Drop tested
	4. Vibration(shake)
	5. Temperature(MIL/STD/883 processing was from tempertures range 
	   -55c to +125c)bake
	6. Misc. frost, water proof, stability tolerance +/- .0001%, sudden 
	   temperature change from +125c to -55c in seconds ..etc
	7. Combinations of all of the above

The components that survive are to say the least extremely reliable, and 
very expensive, there are other grades of components which are the following:

	1. Commerical(Yuk)
	2. Industrial(better)
	3. Military(better better), non /883
	4. Military(best) /883 processing

This is done so that components can be rated for levels of reliability, 
this is why a $.30 cent NPN 2n2222a transistor in mil grade is about 
$5.00. Reliability or rates of failure look like a bathtub curve, with 
the highest rates of failure either at infanticy or old age. A CD player 
with MIL/STD/883 components and similar MIL/STD hardware would be able to 
survive EMP/+,- 100g's/function from -55c to +125c/an distant 
thermonuclear attack ..etc, it would be one touf SOB Cd player, but would 
cost like 300% more the a regular one.

There are Military standards for everything, rubbers to peanut butter 
...etc, everything they use has a standard, even toilet paper.

One final note, these components are realily available tp us all, for a 
price, and can be ordered from most large scale electronics supply house, 
you won't findem in Shit Shack though.

Did it sound like:

I'm interested in the senate bill 314 and have heard a lot of rumors 
about it and am interested in reading the actual bill.  I was hoping that 
someone could either send me a copy of the bill or give me an address 
where i could get it.

Thanks

Monique

p.s. I'll be at XYZ this weekend so if anyone wants to say hi i'll be 
wearing a white shirt with a rose on it and probably jeans.
peace and love

Sounds like stream of conciousness. I have read a book or two using this 
perspective, and while it can be confusing it really lets you get into a 
characters head. Sounds like someone has extrapolated this concept into 
verbalization. Interesting.....

Monique,
All current, pending federal legislation of the 104th congress can be
found on the Library of Congress' Thomas system.  Actually, you can
even find bills from the 103rd congress.  It's pretty cool if you're
interested in laws and how they are created (at least from a political
process standpoint, not a behind the scenes influence pedaling
standpoint). 

To get directly into the Thomas system (104th congress legislation)
go to the following:
    http://thomas.loc.gov/home/c104query.html
under the search by bill number (2nd query option) enter:
    s.314
and voila, all you ever wanted to know about S.314 (communications 
decency act of 1995); all 8391 bytes of it.

Enjoy,
BG

I'm not going to force anyone to change anything, lee, least of all when
I'm at someone else's p[icnic and it has its own whole tradition etc. but
I *am* here in SF and I *do* see california as crucial to the struggle
that the cooperative living meme of RC is now assuming worldwide whether
it's choosing it or not (that's why I'm here) and it's not the cooperative
meme that's choosing an argument, it's the old competitive meme that' s
not going to stand idly by and watch the cream of its youth stolen away from
competition to cooperation - hence the growing problems RC is facing.  would
you like to bet $100 that the whole issue will be even more central
politically, socially, spiritually and even, yes, tecnically a year from
now or even by this summer?

we've had this ongoing debate for 8 years now in the Uk (and that's just
within Rc, never mind Stonehenge, Hippy Fayres and Welsh covens and
Amsterdam psycheleics and all of it) and, until the last 2 years, I've
been getting quite as much"flaming" as here.  that's all changed over
there and is beginning to change here

I'm sorry if I've sounded like I'm telling you what to do, I didn't mean
to do that.  there are obviously a thousand diferent ways.  as for what
I'm going to *do* the question surprises me.  I'm already doing it and
have been for a decade.  mainly it's "talking* about the importance of RC
for the plznet so that we all see it (and you can't think that everyone
realises that surely) and talking about how little time we actually have -
hence the idea of growing a little scene and maintaining it for the rest
of our lives until our children bla bla is just not seeing the situation.
(you may not agree etc but what am I to do if I feel *convinced* to the
depths of my being then surely my duty is to keep on saying it in new
ways, in funny ways, in more insightful ways etc etc) 

nor do I *only* talk.  I act.  allow me to blow my own trumpet for a
paragraph or two since I obviously haven't done it enough for you.  I've
been putting on raves, wisdom weekenders, love labs, illegal, small, legal
massive raves etc AND publishing magazines like Encyclopaedia
Psychedelica, evolution^, zippy times.  I've released acid house singles
with Tium Leary telling people to "Think For Yourself & Question
Authority", it was my record company which arranged for Terence McKenna to
go on the Shamen track (check the label, phred) and we've released
Shamanarchy In The Uk, the best house album yet IMHO. I've also torn up my
roots in the Uk(successful club at last, good high quality lifestyle,
final social acceptance in my home country etc) to come over here because
some inner voice told me to do it.  I've half starved, been insulted,
misunderstood, reviled etc I've also met great friendships and alliances
and love, support and respect and have garnered large amounts of media
attention to use it to spread the good news about RC (now some on sfraves
are beginning to talk about the importrance (hey great word!) of doing
this before we get isolated (as happened in the UK, which is *exactly* why
I've been doing it, even when most didn't yet realise my intentions.  we
put on the Grand Canyon Mega Rave last year in an attempt to spark a
national identity for RC and we took Rave to the annual Rainbow Gathering
in Wyoming last summer for the first time ever, thus achieving the major
aim of the Zippy Pronoiia Tour - to connect Rainbow wisdom and Raver
enthusiasm to create Zippy in the culture (and met Crunchman on my
dancefloor 300 miles from the nearest town!) etc etc.  as for the
immediate future - the Parallel University is trying to spread RC into
other sections of society, older, psychedleic, middleclass etc) I'm giving
a speech on RC at Stanford University in early May and discussing doing a
regular rave room for their monthly dance.  I've been meeting with
alternative politicos about the UN50 celebrations here in Sf this summer. 
I'm spreading word of the 100,000 Rainbow Lovers celebration festival in
ggpark this summer (of course I had no part in setting it up, that would
be illegal) we're working to finally secure a large legal area just
outside the city where nonprofit NGOs could work with us to provide the
very "safe public idealistic events" that some have started to call for
since the Oz raids (we've been at this since february) AND we're *still*
going through the step by steps to open a permanent club centre in the
city that might provide a home for several posses as the law cracks down on
all the renegade parties this summer.  etc etc etc

don't wanna be unravey but some people are telling me that actually it's

all; also many write to me privately that they're glad of what's happening

this.  and, may I repeat, I definitely am not the type to spoil

oh yes, that's another thing I've been *doing* and, even if you don't see 
a global crackdown (yet) you must surely agree that we were not as loopy

couldn't agree more.  we didn't bring the media here, we jumped that wave 
a year early and got out some p0sitive info and vibe to the national press 
BEFORE the word seeped down (or up from the Subconscious if you prefer a 
less conscious conspiracy model) to "DEMONISE RAVING". we did that 
because we'd seen it happen in the Uk, knew the power of the growing 
movement and knew it would happen here.

precisely.  using all the tools available.  but it's not *outside* the
whole political spectrum, it permeates it, includes it because, let's face
it, the lower level is surely the downloading of the higher.  so, I appeal
to you to see that this discussion is one of "downloading strategies" 
(it's great news, it's seeing our vision predominate long after we'd given
up hope) and not all of our generation understsand this:  some appear to
think that meditating off alone is enough when it's actually recuperation. 
we'll be dead and pure spirit soon enough, let's particiapte as free souls
in the apparent plot we find ourselves in - a planet in the final hours of
its ultimate destiny.

it is not I/we who are being confrontational.  the competitive meme will

I wish they would but the proof is starting to lap all around us.  the

 I usually go to only one event on the weekends, so , given my new
interest in Jungle , I will be at the WAVELENGTH Tribal Galactic
Foundation release party tonight at 1015 Folsom. At least two 
of the DJs are known for Jungle mixing - Shobhan and Ocean. I "reviewed"
Ocean's tape here on sfraves a few days ago , and I'm looking forward 
to hearing him mix live. Also , with A.T.O.I. performing , it's hard for
me to give this event a miss.

 If I don't change my mind between now and tonight, you'll know me by
my red & orange meta-tacky patterned Hawaiian shirt - I think I'll be
wearing the one with the little jets on it. Comeon up and say hi , even 
if it looks like I'm trancing out! ( If I meet enough folks enough
times , maybe I'll actually start to remember names better! ).

 If you're not at WAVELENGTH, I wish you lots of fun and/or profound
philosophical experience at whatever event you're at!

Bliss & I are driving up from Santa Barbara this weekend.  We hope that we 
will get the opportunity to meet some of you.  Bliss has not been to a full 
moon in just over a year (since he left SF to move to SB to be with me until I 
finish school).  I have still not been to a full moon.  If any has any 
information that they would be willing to share with us, we would truly love 
to go.  If someone could email us an info # or let us know where the party is, 
we would be happy to bring our wonderful vibe and smiles.

If you have any info, we are leaving Santa Barbara in a couple of hours.  
Please mail it to us at our friends place in sf:

jharwell@ix.netcom.com

Thank you all and have a wonderful weekend!  Hope to see you--bliss always 
appears in a velvet hatty (black & purple) & baggy jeans.

Love to you all :)

This is very true...  I guess I just got worn down with all of those other
posts and yours was just the one to streacch my limits...  I was happy to see
all of the Fraser posts go away so I was just a little bit tweaked out of
shape when I saw more stuff go up...   from anyone.  
Well I'm glad we both understand each other a little better now.  Sometimes
it takes a little heat to mix things up ; )  Thanks for the invite to hang
out...  If you are really interested in electronic music  you are more than
welcome lto come and hang out in my studio anytime  (that goes for anyone
else too: )
See Ya,
Rob

Terence McKenna refers to it as Glossolalia (sp?), or the uninterrupted
flow of language.
- from my own experiments is does seem that it is possible to experience
language as a virus, as something we wear like a set of clothing, or
something we channel , like a character on a stage.
In fact, I often find my spoken vocabulary ebbs and flows according to my
state of mind. Extreme Poetry being the hightened speech form of altered
states, and  stumbling, incoherency the state of stuttering speech
normality.

Actually, they'll be playing the Cinema Bar in SLC on the 25th and 26th.  
Crash Worship will be playing all over the west, including places like 
Montana.  Check the tour schedule in rec.music.industrial.

Have fun!

Bad news...  The full moon was last night, out in the delta, according to 
Wicked voice mail.  Anyone go?  Supposedly FMM will be putting 
one on in Portland Saturday night.  Or even better, you can go to 
solyluna on Saturday, an "alternative" full moon party perhaps?

Hello all concerned sfravers,

I have noticed some confusion on the list and i just wanted to point out 
to everyone that DEAKS aka "ERNIE" Deakyne is OK and still has both of 
his ears. He is just in Oregon for the weekend.

RE: Ernie of SESAME STREET and SESAME STREET FEVER fame is still missing. 
The last reported sighting was in Buenos Aires but I am working on 
hooking up a live video feed of the possible holding location to the 
Cloud Factory Homepage & will post as soon as the connection is complete.
Our prayers are with you ERNIE!(Both of you)

See you under the moon,

Tim McKnew

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Well, we haven't had any major brainstorms about a pre-party gathering
on Saturday, given the somewhat isolated location of the event at the
Expo Center up by Jantzen Beach and far from downtown Portland.  We could
go to a tavern or brewpub but that doesn't work if you're under 21, and
so on.

So instead I'll just invite anyone who'd like to drop in to visit my office
downtown in Portland on Saturday.  I'll probably be around from 2 pm or so
on.  It's in the vicinity of SW 4th and Washington.

Call ahead to 503/222-9572 or 870-5532 and I'll give you directions.  I've
got turntables, CD player, mixer, amp, speakers and two terminals for
Internet login :-)

See ya'll in the future!

Dear all, i'm sorry for wanking off on your list about other music and 
dance- too much wine Sunday morning, i'll resist the urge next time, will 
find email pals to muse all we want about 80's fabulousness, Siouxsie, 
that icky rawk stuff.

just one last word on dance- tears flowed at the start of the Lambarena 
ballet on some of our faces- not because of the beauty of the 
choreagraphy, the gorgeous orange-yellow flowing kente cloth, or the 
successful mutation of bach and African choruses and drumming, not 
because it was joyful and not watered down, but because there we were 
stuck in our seats or standing room stall, a hierarchicalized audience 
looking up at sublime creatures in another world, stuck in our awkward 
oh-so appreciative, sensitized, but motionless selves
 once again in appreciation of street dance, house, rave, disco, chill 
out or whatever you wanna call it

I went to this last weekend, it's really quite good, I thought. Very nice way to
spend Sunday evening for us South Bay people (It's walking distance from my

take care all!

Well, i dont bother posting anything on sfraves, but i need to vent.

I dont know about any of you people out there, but Ex Why zZz was 
probably, the best rave i went to. really. i personally enjoy driving from 
oakland out to some hick truck stop out in the middle of god knows where. I 
truely love standing in the rain for an hour and half, moving about 10 
feet forward the entire time.  The security guard at the door was more 
than nice. 

This was probably the worst experience i've had at a "rave" (if that is 
what it might be called).  i dont know who the hell fucked up, but they 
did it big time. i will never go to another ZYX party again. someone 
needs to have their balls chopped for this one. 

Did anyone get inside? (Im sure some "special" person that had bought 
their ticket in advance is on this mailling list. let me know how it was.)

I did try to get my ticket at housewares, but they had sold out. oh 
well..never again..never.

yeah i got into XYZ.    


  i donno what to say but to agree that this party definately
bit the big one in having their shit together.  we got there
around midnight and then enjoyed the next two hours waiting 
outside in the rain getting poured on.  luckily i was with some
friends and all and we had a fun time cracking shit up and 
fucking around in the line (if anyone saw me i had this Green
sweatshirt on outside  babbling about NASA kids, and Frankie Bones
and bum-rushing the door;)  but eventually after quite a lot 
of finangling we got in and through the door.  the inside was o.k.
i had an cool time when they finally let the people waiting outside in
sometime after 3:00 am?  i  was in one of those:  why the fuck am
i out here being dumb and getting sick? ?  this whole rave thing is a joke
ive been fucking around being part of
.  call me the cynic raver =)   but when things got going
with Tony there were a lot of smiling faces and people into the 
music and a nice vibe, that i had a good time.  
  i also took some pictures of the people dancing and all but i
dont know how they turned out.  hope theat look ok :)

Well hearing about EX WHY Zee, I am reticent to post what a good time a 
couple of friends and I had at Evolution. Small, comfortable space, $7, 
nice people, water freely available. Two floors one well, I would say the 
ambient room, except what was being played was anything but. Still cool 
though, heard a Phil Collins cover of a Beatles song and Prince. What 
more could you ask for, hehehe..... Bottom floor was for the serious 
dancing, nothing particularly awe inspiring but good, tight sets from 
what I heard. Boy I have to say I feel REEEAL sorry for you poor folks 
that bought advanced tickets for ex why zee, to find out the party was in 
Stockton. Wonder whose bright idea that was, eh?

is it a "rave" when hostile security guards in combat boots seem to be the 
only ones running the show outside (BACK UP! OR NO ONE GETS IN) and inside 
(I SAID, NO SMOKING IN THE BUILDING OR WE SHUT THE PARTY DOWN!)

yeah, Tony was inspired. not only his music and spinning and connection with 
the dancers, but he seemed to be the only dj who understood the limits of 
the sound system. the others, from Jon on, didn't seem to notice that their 
extra volume saturated the speakers into a droning buzzrumble, 
smearing over the texture that Tony brought out so beautifully.

too bad most people, including some who had actually arrived at 11 like 
the phone message suggested, were still outside in line in the rain during 
Tony's set.

 [ This is a late review of two events that happened last Saturday ]

 On the same night as last week's outdoor Liquid Air, I was invited to
a party that our own John S. Lee was going to spin at. I arrived at the
site , to find that it was Cyberlab. They had to move it tho' , so it
eventually ended up at the same site as the busted Friends and Family -
only the upstairs was used. 

 Setup caused a delay - John was scheduled to be the first up at 9PM,
but he didn't get started until after 10:30PM. He played a nice set of
tasty house , followed by DJ Polliwog. I've never heard her spin before,
and was pleasantly surprised to hear someone who made such an effort to
mix in short pieces. Also an eclectic mixer - as someone said , it doesn't
work 100% of the time , but it's great when it does work!

 I ducked out to Liquid Air , but , despite an excellent acid trance mix
by Joe Rice , the cold made me retreat back to the hot Cyberlab party.
( so , I missed the almost-bust that Bryce averted ). I believe Ernie
Munson (?) was spinning when I got back , and the dancefloor was comfortably
populated - no problem with overcrowding, and a sane line of about 8
people deep at the door. Since the party was word-of-mouth , it probably 
helped to control the crowd size. 

 There was a great vibe! That's all I need to say ... I danced until my
feet got too sore ( gotta get new shoes ).

WAVELENGTH at 1015 Folsom
 I usually don't care for Friday events , because I'm usually working
all day Friday and get tired quicker that evening. But I was curious
about Wavelength at 1015 Folsom , because of the great lineup ( Trance
Mission , Ambient Temple of Imagination ) and Shohban and Ocean , two
Jungle DJs . 
 Upon entering 1015 Folsom , I was greeted by Disco! The top front room
was the disco room , while the top back room was for the performance of 
Trance Mission and then DJ music. The top floor had a DJ setup and another
bunch of folks with keyboards and other equipment , but I never found
out who they were. Buzznet on-line magazine had a corner room ( they left
halfway through the evening ).  In the basement was A.T.O.I. and another
DJ setup. 
 Prior to Trance Mission's set, Cheb i Shebah played some great non-western
dance music. Along with this were video projections of non-western 
naked and near-naked non-white people doing exotic non-western stuff.
As you can probably tell , I'm getting somewhat annoyed by now of the
use of documentary material of "tribal" peoples as video wallpaper at
raves and clubs. I can't put my finger on it quite - if anyone wants
to talk about it with me , send me email. ( Why not videos of white
nudists ? ). 
 Trance Mission started at about 10:30PM - nice music , not quite what
I wanted at the time , but I could see getting into it in my living room.
My fatigue got to me then , and at other times during the evening. I sat
at the back of the dancefloor during much of Trance Mission's set. 
( Actually, the semi-sleep altered conciousness I was in played some cool
games with my head ).
 I ducked downstairs to catch a set by Freezer , a duo [ Peter(BPM/0) and
Joshua(Thermal) ] who have done gigs by themselves and with A.T.O.I. 
Mixture of vinyl ( for beats ) and live keyboards and other instruments.
Later , A.T.O.I. played their set. Both were great ( as far as I could
tell between naps! ).
 By the time I got back upstairs , it was DJ music -  nice techno ! While
dancing , I found myself next to DJ Shohban , so I was able to find out
when her and Ocean were going to be spinning downstairs.
 I got downstairs early, and was glad that I did. A.T.O.I. cleared out
their instruments while Freezer did their thing with instruments and vinyl.
There was a bald asian fellow sitting in meditation next to them - one
of the DJs leaned over and talked to him for a few seconds. I turned my
attention back to dancing - after a few minutes , I noticed someone to
my right. It was the bald fellow, but he was now moving to the performance 
area that A.T.O.I. had vacated. He was naked except for a Japanese style
white breechcloth . The light of the candles gave his shaved limbs and
torso a waxen quality. He was a Japanses Buto dancer (I may have the term
or spelling wrong). He gave an intense performance.
 Constant motion - slow and flowing, and more spastic. Moves based on the
postures of fetuses , water , smoke , the crippled , the mad. His face was 
constantly transforming into archetypal expressions of awe , rage ,fear ,
demonic possesion, joy , and ecstacy. 
 He ended the performance as the began it - walking in a trance-like manner
back to his spot next to the DJ booth. 
 Following that were Jungle music sets by Shohban , then Ocean. Such a joy
to dance to! I think I'd like to see one of these Jungle DJs mixing before
or after DJ DRC - that would be a pair of sets to hear!

 I finally conked out with my head on a leopard print pillow halfway through
DJ Ocean's set , and left soon after I woke up. All in all , an interesting
evening! Too bad I was so tired ( and most of the SFRavers I knew by sight
had left earlier in the evening , so I was a little lonely - boohoo! ).

 Hope you folks are having fun at Sunset!

This event sounds great (except for the disco...).   Trance
Mission, non-western dance music, some jungle DJs... let me
know about anything like that you hear about.  This could
get me back into raving.  

(Mostly I've been doing weird jazz/ambient industrial
stuff... Lots of cool things happening at "Beanbenders" in
Berkeley these days, in addition to Tuesdays at the Hotel
Utah and Sundays at Radio Valencia.  And I'd really like to
get up to the city tonight to see the Myles Boisen jam at
the Killowatt... ah well, maybe I'll make it.)

Dear All;

	First my sincerest sympathy goes out to the people who were let
down my the Ex WHY ZZZ thing, wow fuckin Stockton, a minor word of advice,
don't ever buy a ticket to an event where the location is unknown, that
was very slezzey of the people who put it on. I was actually going to go
to EX WHY ZZZ, and like Cool World changed my mind at the last minute,
glad I did. They should have told people up front where the party was. The
recording said a "New Bay Area Location", boy is that pushin it. I guess I
don't understand the point of hiding the location if its legal and
permitted. Unless you have something to hide, like excessive greed. Flame
me if you like, but everyone knows it was a rip, "fool me once shame on
you, fool me twice shame on me." I would really like to hear an honest 
explanation for hiding the event location, when I called the voice mail 
at 5pm they said they would have directions and stuff on there at 7am 
Saturday, I understand why they were late in getting them on. Again this 
is just speculation on my part, and I would really like to hear there 
side of the story, if they have on.

	As far as Evolution went I'll call it the undergroundyest event
that Saturday night short of a private party I wasn't aware of. I like my
events small, house party like and intimate, intimacy over fuckin hype
anyday anytime. An Evolution had it all, and much more, really friendly
people, I wish I had brought me massage table. The music was killer on
both floors. I went with Veronica Degroovy(piedra@rohan,sdsu.edu), it was
the 1st time we met, and she is a sweetie, and "A Cute Little Muchkin",
hope your trip is safe and filled with joy, and beautiful scenery all the
way down, miss ya all ready :). 

	If the space at 7th and Folsum lasts, I feel it will be a great 
place to have small raves at. Its proablly good for about 200-300 people 
comfortabley, anything more than that wouldn't be very nice, but thats 
just a guess. I really hope this space last, because I'll be back, for 
sure. I heard a rumor their going to be doing a monthly, if anyone 
involved with Evolution can verify the validaity of that rumor, please do 
let me know. I had a great time and look forward to going again, please 
soon :).

Dear All;

	A while ago someone requested info on the Storm DJ's, well here it 
is, note I have nothing to do with this party, just doing a RSA(Raver 
Service Annoucement): Info sourced from flyer.

	STORM 1015 FOLSUM, WED. APRIL 19TH, 1995:
	Brought to you by Red Five Productions

	Tracy (Sunset)	Christope(CDC)	Billy(SF)	 Lil Steven(Evolution)
	
	Jeno(Wicked)	C.Lawerence(LA)	Krista(Montreal) Henrik(Spundaes)

	Garth(Wicked)	Dutch(CDC)	J.Johnson(NYC)	 Taj(Zendada)

	Ryme(France)	John Mac(420)	R.Hardkiss(Hardkiss)

			Visuals by Donovan

	Looks like a good one, and its free, but with all due respects to 
1015 Folsum, I hope they don't shut down at 4am, like they did with 
Community, even though the dance floor was packed. Its really dangerous 
for the people who come to your event, eg driving.

Peace & Love
Brian Darkness

Hello to all my groovy and ravy friends out there:

Here's my question/situation: My housemate's friend is coming to visit
Berkeley this weekend, and we all plan on going out to a rave on Saturday
night...as far as I know, there are two events that night, right? KIVA
and Progress?  I was wondering if any of you could recommend which one you think
will be better and why.  Are there any other things going on that I haven't 
heard about?  Ideally, I like my raves (says Tim expertly, even though he's
been raving for a month :) ) kind of how Brian Darkness described Evolution:
intense, intimate, with substance over hype and lazers...kinda like the last

Hey y'll

	First of all thanks for all the cool responses to my post on 
thought rythms.  :)

As far as XYZ goes:
  Can we say "MMEEAAT MARRKET"

excellent music*once inside* 
I only saw one other person with a passafier(sp?)
I tried to hug this one guy that looked cool... he rudely rejected the 
show of affection by pushing me back..That's ok ,I then tried to give him 
 a blow pop and he turned that down..

Oh well in my opinion what a jerk.:(

I brought along to girlfriends that were met with ego inflated freakers 
as soon as they tried to start dancing.  This was their first rave too.
My friend jeff and I were apologetic for having talked so highly of these 
gatherings and then having them see thge reasons that these parties get 
such shitty reputations.  Was quite a downer for jeff and I.

Would someone pleez smack me very hard in the face next time I even 
consider going to a party that requirs "pre-sale tickets"BAAAAAA!

Really cool, lets get every one sick and cold and then let them inside.
YEa that bring em back again next year..

There were some cool people there though..Just took a little 
looking around..
Unfortuanly this party was very sobering in a sense to the reality that 
"raves" that's right "raves"  are pretty sick in most peoples eyes.  If I 
was a concerned citizen I would have called the police long ago on this one.

OOOOOHHH.such an ideal location too!!
When I parked my car in the neighbor hood surrounding the roller rink..
I was approached by some local police.
They drove up to the car and stopped and asked me what was gaoing on.

I politly said" it is a party" ,"No one is excluded""you should go sometime"
he said and kind of grinned,"well thanks but I don't really think so"

I later saw that same cop along with his pals inside wathcing the dancers 
and the whole trip.  I soberly approached him and asked how it was going.
I calmly tried to explain to him a little bit more abstractly the true 
values that these parties represent to many of us.  BUt with the currnet 
example being performed in fron to his eyes he must have thought I was 
completetly full of crap.  That;s what I would have thouhht.

OK I realize that these parties are what you make of them , and I guess 
it was  cool to see people dancing but...When you see that majority of 
the peoples underlying intentions seemed other than what I "perssonally 
see as the perpetuation of the rave spirit" Its a real downer!PLeez skip 
the temptation to flame..I don't mean to offend anyone.:(

HUgs to the warm people.It felt good to go throught the night sober for once.
It just didn't seem like the right place to e bcause You couldn't be 
affectionate to many peolpe with out getting highly raised eyebrows and 
ugly smirks of disapproval.

A definate "TWO THUMBS DOWN"

I heard that hight that xyz just attracted a different crowd.  Well this 
is not the crowd I enjoyed at ALL..

My spirit was torn betwwen the celebations that I knew were happening 
elsewhere in the wolrd that I wanted to experience,that I tried to 
perpetuate at this party, and the tagging ego tipping ,C'mon baby don't 
you wanna, attitude that I couldn't escape from at this party.

Soory for the negativity Folks
it had to be done..

Hugs anyway
Dan

Peace

Overall, a Wicked's visit to Portland for the FMW (Full Moon Weekend) was
quite a good time.  I had lots of visitors at my office/DJ shop (including
Geoff, Rox and her sister and friend from Eugene), Susie and Collin (of
course), Eli and friends from Seattle, and Randy and Lindsey.  Sorry if
I missed anyone in the course of my ins-and-outs.  

We left my office at 10:15 and stopped at Waddle's for a soso dinner
before going in.  The Expo Center turned out to be a very nice venue
indeed except for the concrete floors which were hard on the ole knees.
The Purple People Pusher did a pretty good job filling the West Hall
but it would have been nice to have another matching setup to do quad
sound -- nonetheless it was fine quality sound.  The outdoor tent/ambient/
chill space (chilly indeed) was set up nicely with rugs and beanbag chairs
and *excellent* music, I only caught a bit of Dervish's set though.  
Inside was Thomas-Markie-Garth-Jeno.  I think things fizzled a bit around
3:30 when Garth started into that typical FMR deep dark vibe, though his
mixing and the visuals were outstanding.  But Jeno came on at 5:15 with
a 90 minute rippingly uplifting set to finish off.

Went to La Luna for the afterparty, a nice set by Dazy and a rare appearance
by Doran, who was unhappy with his set but I thought it smoked and told him
so :-)  Took a bit of a nap and headed down to Powers Park along the
Willamette, but we got there around 5:30 and found the system had been
shut down because of noise complaints around 3.  

The remaining crew is up in the mountains east of Portland as I speak
doing the final benediction for this wonderful weekend.  The weather
was amazingly perfect today, 65 and pure sun.  

I'm hanging in here to type in these few words, gotta get up early and
go to the legislature tomorrow, so more later . . .

Hi everybody,
I was curious to find out what everyone's favorite words of advice for
raving were. I've met so many people recently, and they always say stuff
like "Tim, just rememeber, when you go to a rave, you MUST..." and some people
say bring a certain candy, some always wear that same hat, some eat breakfast
at the same spot, some always take certain toys, etc. etc. 
What do you guys always do?  My pre-rave preparations are still evolving;
I usually just make sure to a) shower b) bring a pacifier, lotion, and candy
and c) enough $$$.  Boring, huh? 
What are your musts for happy ravers?
PLUR
Timothy

Timothy,
I don't have any major musts or hard fast rules.  I do suggest, if you 
take any sustances to enhance your experience, educate yourself about it 
as much as you can.  I try to make sure I drink plenty of water so I 
don't dehydrate.  Aside from that I like to let love take care of the rest.

This was one of those San Francisco socially conscious crosscultural
appreciation events for the hip mainstream kind of thing.  Janie & I went 
mainly to see Trance Mission, and we knew that this would in no way
resemble a rave.

Larry:

We also found the video to be pretty tacky.  It wasn't presented with any
kind of artistic intent, nor did it foster any kind of connectivity between
us, the observers, and the on screen tribalism.  At most raves I've been
to, this kind of stuff usually gets mixed in with other cultural images,
psychedelic overlays, etc. with everyone dancing along with what's on 
the screen in an overall synergy that usually works for me.  At
Wavelength it basically felt like a form of voyeurism.

In the basement, the socially conscious part was happening with some kind
of puppet show.  Something about a zookeeper beating on a guy in a gorilla
suit.

>  Trance Mission started at about 10:30PM - nice music , not quite what
> I wanted at the time , but I could see getting into it in my living room.

They seemed rather lethargic compared to the last time we saw them.  The
Madonna bleed-through from the disco room didn't help any.   But I highly
recomend their newest CD, "Therefore".  Powerful, uplifting, trancy 
digeridoo based music with fantastic production values.  One of my best 
1994 purchases.

He did his thing during Trance Mission's set as well. It was sort of 
interesting but self-indulgent in that he wasn't really dancing to the 
music or *with* us.  Just something else for the audience to look at.  

I guess one rave-related connection was the herbal "e"(tm) booth, where
for $18 you could get what was basically a couple of smart drinks in pill
form.  The ingrediants were stuff you could get in any health-food store
for about 1/5 the price (unless you care to believe the sales guy who
explained to me that the ginseg was "from Tibet and more 
concentrated" etc. etc...)  He also tried to convince me that this stuff 
gives you "80% of the full effects of MDMA, everything except the 
empathy part." Great.  

I guess this was a good event for a mainstream type party, and the $12 
seemed fair for the variety of entertainment offered.  It just wasn't 
our kind of scene.

Fraser,
I appreciate all your intentions toward saving the world.  It feels like 
your trying to put alot of that responsibility on "RC".
Seeing myself participating in and being a part of "RC", I sometimes feel 
a little overwhelmed with the thought of saving the world.
For me raving helps me open up to myself, which in turn opens me up to 
more of the world.  Being more open to the world lets me be more loving 
to it, and helps keep me from doing anything destructive, including 
things that I might not have realized as being destructive.
Loving the world also helps me respect the world and flow with the pace 
of its change.  Beautiful changes are happening with the help of raving 
as more people join the flow.  Pushing or insisting on the flow seems to 
create resistance imho.
Fraser it seems like you have alot of high expectations of "RC", almost 
sound a little desparate at times for others to recognize the potential 
that you see.  I know I've recognized alot of potential for how raving 
has helped myself internally, and externally with my relationships.
I'd be interested in hearing how it has helped YOU, aside from all the 
awareness of how miserable the world is and how much change is needed.  
Not that I don't want to hear about that, because I do think its 
important to take a look at all perspectives as much as possible.  I 
wonder if raving helps you see as it does me that the world is also a 
very beautiful place, very balanced, where as much misery and suffering 
there is, there is also as much beauty and joy.
Fraser, I must say that I admire your persistance, and drive to make the 
world a better place.  I'm also thankful that there are people like 
yourself, that do want to help change things for the better.  Just hope 
you get some time to smell some roses along the way.

By now, many of you have heard of some of the problems at XYZ.  There is
truth in all views here.

>From my understanding, there was a new, Bay area venue planned, but it got
disapproved by the Fire Marshal on Friday night.  So, after scrambling
around, the XYZ people rented a roller rink in Lodi on Saturday morning.
They couldn't get in until 9pm to set up anything, either.  Now, let's
hope they learned the basic lesson we call "back-up space", but let's
move on.  I'll accept their apologies and be glad they did what they
had to do to recover and go on with the party.

Myself and two roommates drove up from LA (we *really* needed to get out
of town for a bit - mini work vacation which you may not fully understan
if you haven't been in motion picture production).  We got in to SF, called
our friends with the directions, only to find we had to turn around and
drive back where we just came from.  Oh well.

We get to the place and got in line.  Seems no one was being let in yet,
due to the aforementioned sound system setup delays.  Slight drizzle called
for the jackets that no native Detroiter would ever be without, no matter
where in the world you find yourself.  I spoke a bit to the main security
guy at the door, and he was friendly and helpful (trying to find a dj friend
that was scheduled to be spinning).

Security was a big deal for the roller rink.  They were bringing four people
at a time into the lobby and doing very complete searches.  Evidence of this
need was shown by all the taggers that bombed the rental truck outside.
The guy at the door was hard-nosed but professional.  The thing they didn't
to was control the line in the sense of people starting at the end of the
line instead of pushing in near the door.  My friends and I waited near the
end of the line for three hours, and we always seemed to be near the end of
the line while the number of people doubled.  I was beginning to get annoyed,
having been on the other end of parties like this and knowing how to control
this kind of problem, and seeing nothing was being attempted.

We finally got in, and took a trip around.  The sound was poorly tuned but
was a nice system.  With another hour or so, that system could have been
top-notch.  I didn't really notice Tony's set, as I was still trying to
cool down from the annoyance of the previous three hours.  Some really
funky beats were going down just as I started to get my body & mind ready,
but then they changed DJ's, and "Energy Flash" came on.  Of course, what
DJ opens his every set with his own old track - Joey Beltram.  I've heard
Joey enough to know I should just spend some more time with my friends
and not worry about dancing for a while.

Due to air conditioning problems and the possible noise complaints if the
doors were open, they shut off the sound for about 20 minutes and opened
all the doors while fixing the A/C.  Then DJ Hipp-E came on, and he was
great!  Some good techno & house, mixed well, that kept me dancing for the
duration of his set.  After that, some other dj came on, but I didn't care
for his style, so I just wandered.  We left soon after and got some breakfast.

Overall impressions:  lot's of kids (emphasis on kids), pretty friendly,
poor dj's & music selection (but remember, I am a cynical Detroiter, so
use salt), and poor business planning on the promoters part.

All in all, at least I got away from work for the weekend and got to hug
a couple of my friends that I seldom get to see!  What more could I really
ask for?

Gee, I didn't know I had to bring alot of stuff....I just bring myself 
and my friends, and everybody seems *quite* satisfied! :)
Sometimes for kicks we'll bring little stickers or rings to pass out.  
One time I had these pencils made out to say "Spread the love and rave 
on".  People looked at me weird when I handed them a pencil cuz they 
couldn't read what it said in the dark, but hopefully the next morning 
they'd look at it and think, "Yeah, right on!!"

Take care all,
Amy

At first sight, the event seemed way too hip with an extremely uptight
crowd. Watching trance form while the full moon rose was kinda cool, but
the dark lighting disturbed me somewhat (no eye contact with anyone).
Anyway, just as I was about to go, struck up a great conversation with
Peter Booth Lee and Michael Mantra and took a break outside until 3am,
whereupon my return, everything seemed totally more ravey. The tribal djs
were doing their thang downstairs, and I couldnt resist dancing and
trancing. Moving upstairs, it seemed like the crowd was a bit stiff, but
after a serious bit of trancedancing, everyone seemed to lighten up and the
vibe accelerated until I was getting free hugs and a lot of those
previously cool coutureculture people were waving their arms in the air and
screeching. Three drummers parked themselves in front of the one speaker
stack and proceeded to do some harmonic navigation.
Have'nt danced so hard in a long while, and by 7 am I was totally bushed
and had to leave to rescue my camero from a parking zone.

Well, i think the event was a success, and certainly introduced jungle
trance to a whole bunch of people who probably had never been to a rave
before. I think they liked it, judging from the smiles and all.

Hi all,

I heard from a friend recently that the raves in the UK were muuuch more
intense than the raves round here; i.e. many more bpm over there, people
dancing with a LOT more vigour, and less trancey/chill stuff....he was
saying he wished it was more like that over here.  Has anyone raved over 
there?  I'd like a second opinion.
Talk to you guys later,
Rings, Mambas, Taco Bell burritos, pacifiers, and good vibes to all,

Timothy

hey everyone,

 wanted to say that sunset yesterday was as always a fun time :)
i drove with a few friends from SF and got to the site right near
the Richmond bridge. it was a little park by the bay with some rides
for kids.  nice tree's and nice views.  i was a bit tired but once
the sound got going it was cool.  i wasnt in the most friendly mood
when i got there but there were these guys blowing through some PCB
pips making the Digeridoo sounds and they let me blow on one for 
awhile and look at the bay.  it got me in a really good mood and
when i turned around 20 minutes later two hundred more people had shown
up :)  probably like 400 in all.  
  so i went around and ended up taking a lot of pictures and meeting
a lot of people.  the vibe was _very_ nice  and a lot of fun.  and, i
finally met some SFRAVERS! ;)  so that was cool.  
  but thanks to Pacific for getting their sound out and throwing 
another one.  after going to a party like xyz the night before, it was 
good to go to this and remember why i still love raving :)

peace and take care,

doug ) ( dougie@netcom.com

well, i shouldn't talk, since I've never been to a uk rave, but still, i 
believe every place has it's own way, it's own influences, it's own 
character. Yes, we should still clue in on what example uk can give us in 
improving the scene, but diversity is GOOD!!!

missing sf, but totally open to the nyc scene,

um, i don't know if 1015 folsom has much of a choice in the matter.  i 
seem to remember last year that they had their afterhours license

and in terms of substances, i would try and make it a point to find out

Dear All;
	
	Note, these are my personal opinions not facts, "The World Though 
My Eyes, Mind, Spirit, and Heart." I've said this before and I'll say it 
again, I don't expect or want you to change, I don't want you to follow 
me, and I don't want to lead you, I want you to find and be yourself, and I 
will continue to love you for whomever you chose to be and are. This in 
my opinion is LOVE.

	The only person you can "change" is yourself, and with regard to
the world, all you can do is bring "Awareness" into peoples lives, and
hope and pray(spiritually) that the rest will take care of itself, but any
forced, or imposed change by an outside the self force is violent and
inappropreiate, and most times will be met with prevailing resistance, it
is our nature. I just watched Slinders List for the 1st time last night,
what a statement about the resolve of human beings to, no matter what the
outside forces of the world dictate or do, to still maintain an indenty,
thats different than the current status quo, even at the risk of life, and
lim. 

	We are all fantastic, wonderful beings, uniquely different, all
masterpieces in our own rights. 

	The best way, I think to change the world in a non-violent way is
to unconditionally love and respect people who are different than us, love
them for who they are, and not try and change them, because they have
every right to be whom ever they chose, this is our BIRTH RIGHT and our
nature, and even if someone is preachin hate. This way of being is something
that you never achieve or arrive at, its something that you approach over
life times, Jesus Christ's "NATURE" was about this, less all the religious
bullshit. 

	Pure Love isn't about expectations, or changin people, its seeing in 
ourselves that we are truely wonderful, and when we see that in 
ourselves it shines out of us like rays and enables us to see it, and 
love others for it no matter who they are. I try and work on this 
everyday of my life. Nuff said.

the fact that "addictive pain med's" are doled out by Doctots like there 
diamonds. The med's I'm talking about are Tylenol #3,& 4; Vicodin, Lortab, 
Lorcet, Hydrocet, Talwin, Percodan, Percocet, Demerol, Daladin, Morphine, 
& Darvon/Darvocet.

	There doled out this way because Doctors are afaird of losing 
there DEA licenses, not beacsue there extremely addictive. The fact is 
people suffer from cronic pain can get relieve from these med's, but 
often have to go 1st to pain clinics and try all sorts of DANGEROUS 
experimental drugs, that require almost dailly monitoring of sertate 
bodily functions to make sure these druvgs are not damaging the body. THe 
non-steroidal antiinflamitories, like Motrin, Toradal, Anaprox ..etc, 
supress your bodies immune system, and are contraindicated in people with 
AIDS, and anyone with a depressed immune system, but our ethical doctors 
don't tell you this, plus they are also very damaging to the GI tract.

	In the state of California it is not illegal to go from doctor to 
docotor and get the above mentioned narcotic pain meds, but the 
pharmasist and doctors routinely talk about people over the phone, 
exchanging information about you, violating your right to privancy, my how 
ethical these people are.

	This has happened to me a lot, I remember calling a pharmacy up, 
Payless in Lafayette, and told the pharmasist I was Doctor so so and asked 
what medications Brian had received from whatever doctors they had listed 
on theere computers, I used a doctors name in Florida I used to see, so 
it was not a name or a voice the pharamist would regonize, and she told 
me everything about me, without asking for any id, this is illegal, but 
because of the witchhunt that goes on in our country with regard to drug 
users, your consitutional rights are out the window. I encourage you to 
try this, call a pharmacy you use, say you are a doctor whomever, and ask 
about yourself, make sure you are recording the conversation if you have 
the kind of equipment, and see for yourselfs just what happens.

	If you need to go from doctor to doctor to get relieve from 
cronic pain, which will put you in the grave faster than being addicted 
to narcotic pain meds, and thats a well known medical fact, I have the 
following advice for you. Go to small privately owned pharmacies, not the 
chain stores because they are part of a network/computer, in other words 
the following drug stores have linked computers:

	1.	Walgreens(Nationwide LInk)
	2.	Thifty JR(Not appartent but Linked, they have to enter  
		codes to look at another store)
	3.	Payless(The same as above)
	4.	Longs(Not Linked Yet)
	5. 	Safeway(Linked)
	6.	Lucky's(Not Linked)

Be careful, like I said its not illegal yet, but unfortuately they 
routinely send out faxes with peoples names on them that have received a 
lot of narcotic pain med's. Its really ashame that there are substances  
available and can improve the quality of someones life, but due to the 
conservative, we can't have any druggies out there witchhunt, and I don't 
care what anyone saids its a witchhunt, that people have to suffer.

Eventually there will be a think call PharmNet, were doctors will put 
your prescribtion on a Nationwide computer network, and you will go to a 
pharamcy of your choice, they will call the network up, and get it that 
way. This is being done to prevent prescribtion forgery, and to get the 
druggies.

Peace & Love
Brian Darkness

     A funny thing happened to me when I attended a rave and I was 
     wondering if anyone has experienced something similiar.  First let me 
     give you some background:  1)  I'm allergic to metals worn against my 
     skin; and 2)  I dance on a regular basis with a dance collective.  
     
     The primary dancing I do is called contact improvisation and it's a 
     blend of modern dance, akido, and sensory awareness (in a nutshell).  
     So being aware of my body and my environment (with the floor, the 
     walls, and people, etc.) is very important.  In some ways, dancing at 
     raves is limiting (physically for me) and in other ways, it opens me 
     up :)
     
     I think I've seen it mentioned in this newsgroup before about the 
     relationship between the pounding bass, tribal dancing, and opening 
     chakras or maybe it's what I've read somewhere.  Regardless of these 
     influences, when I dance at raves I try to loosen my body up and 
     move/shake enough to open up my lower chakras.  When I do this, I find 
     it's much easier to open my crown chakra that brings me into a 
     wonderful state of bliss.
     
     At Wicked, I wore a loose silver double-helix bracelet.  Usually I 
     store my tension below my left shoulder, but for most of the evening I 
     kept feeling tension on my right shoulder.  Aware of the blockage, I 
     asked several people (at separate times) to place their hand over my 
     "wing" so I could concentrate on removing this block.  With no change, 
     I chilled with a friend and while hanging out, I realized that my 
     bracelet was hindering me.  I quickly switched the bracelet to my 
     other wrist only to realize that wearing it was a total mistake and so 
     I had my friend wear it for the remainder of the time.  
     
     After this experience, I started thinking about trance dancing and 
     what others do to get into the state of "ecstatic dance".  For _me_ 
     it's just another realization of how repetition be it chanting, 
     dancing, drumming, etc. allows us to get beyond our personal state of 
     mind and into a group consciousness/awareness.
     
     I'd like to hear from others who may have had a blockage experience 
     (esp. w/metals) as well as others who have their tried and true 
     _natural_ method of getting into a trance state.  If the group wants, 
     I can post what feedback I get.
     
     TTFN,
     Diane

i went to an ex why zzz in santa cruz a while back, and while i did 
enjoy myself, any fun i had was basically connected to the mushys i was 
coming off of and to the terrific friends i was with and was in no way 
inspired by the "rave" itself.  the visuals were weak and dj dan didn't 
show, for example.  xyz did remind me of a valuble truth, though, and it 
is that NO party us worth $20 (unless, of course, the orb is there or 
the party's on a boat:).

Well.. now if only we had some people from the UK here to answer that..
it's a real shame that all our UK ravers are "lurkers" and never say
anything..

toilet paper or napkins, if it's outdoors or a break-in or run by dodgy 
promoters

herbs i may need for the night: echinacia/goldenseal beforehand for 
immune strength, some ephedra combo for energy, maybe bee pollen, maybe 
gingko biloba and gotu kola to wake me up in a.m....

water (i just about always bring my own, and i totally resent ravers who 
don't think to bring any and then expect me to share, and then especially 
when they don't offer to go refill it at the bar)

maybe something to munch on (banana?)

extra $$$ for whatever

and i think that's about it.

well, i partied in the u.k., and granted it was 2 or 3 years ago, but it 
really seemed like the vibe/energy/musick depended where you went.  my 
favorite parties were outdoor parties with some d.i.y. djs, which were 
pretty housey, as well as Tonka parties, which were also pretty housey 
(but not many divas, thank gaia.  probably progressive house.)  also went 
to a large "RAVE" at school with hard ragga stuff - lots of energy, lots 
of kids, lots of fashion....and then there was club Trade at Turnmills in 
London which was queer (male) and absolutely insane: LOTS of energy, from 
house to hard hard musick at 9am, lots of sweat, and plenty of payoffs to 
the cops to stay open.  

in general, tho', it might be fair to say that there was a lot more 
enthusiasm for raving there, maybe because more people do it, maybe 
because of the criminal justice bill, don't know...maybe too many 
americans are just "too cool" to let loose....?

well, I'm a UK raver and I do admit to being a lurker, but I think 
everyone has heard just about enough of that debate. PLENTY of people 
have expressed the SAME feelings about the scene here and in England - 
they are both brilliant and at the same time different, nuf said.

"victory" in the air, in the numbers, that's all.  it's happening here

        i have, but that was about 5 years ago, my banker would take me
every weekend or so (he had a crush on me...sucker)...the rave scene as i
knew it was and i quote "these warehouse parties where everyone dresses a
little zany...does drugs, etc."then there was also the LIMELIGHT (a club in
an old gothic church) on sunday nights (oh nigel)...they were cool but
hey...i really wouldn't worry about it...just have a good time where you
are (always)...and if you get over there then definitely check it out!!!

WOW, well put.  I only have this tidbit to add: normally we are taught to
view ppl as either bad or good but, after reading some taoist books, i was
introduced to the idea that everyone is a window that has the light of tao
(or energy, or vibe, or the holy spirit, or whatever) that shines thorough
it.  Some people are clear (like they're heavy on the spiritual windex or
something ;)  while others are kinda dusty, the light comes through in
spots but in others it's obfuscated...i guess we should all help each other
wash our windows :)

Sunset was wonderful as always.  Maybe I'm getting old, but I really don't
need much else.  Once you get used to being able to relax outside and really
talk to people without yelling, it makes it harder to go back to the usual
melee.  And I still get in plenty of dancing in too.  It doesn't matter if
its been a sucky week or even if I'm depressed and have to drive to Sunset by
myself :-(  I always wind up feeling energized and in a great mood watching
the sun set behind Mt. Tam, dancing away to funky electro house beats.  The
music was a little inconsistent at times but you know I really didn't care it
just felt casual.

Yes, the time is approaching for me and my motley band of
ravers to be heading down to sf for this weekend.

We are on a mission to meet copious amounts of sfravers when we
are down there. I will be equipped with my nw-raves badge at the
uziq show. Come up and say 'High?' :) What do I look like?
Tall and blond probably wearing an Exist Dance t-shirt.

Sounds like we are staying at the Globe and will be operating out
of there for the weekend.

Also we would like to check out the Audium if at all possible.
Can anybody point us that way?

Where can I find Radio Free Berkley?  My friends
want to set up a transmitter in their record shop.

Other cool sites to hit (as if I need to ask)?

Finally, if anybody can give me any hints on where to find cheap
new or used SL1200's (one or two) while I am down there it would
be much appreciated. They are bloody expensive to have shipped
up to Canada.

Thanks tons and I look forward to meeting y'all at the uziq
show and in the enusing mayhem afterwards.

Got a flyer for this party, the first of nine to coincide with the nine
insights of the Celestine Prophecy.  If  you haven't heard of the Celestine
Prophecy, its a very amazing book that I can't recommend enough. Go get it
and read it! It really sums up a lot of things I think and feel, especially
in relation to what I have experienced, felt and learned at the gatherings we
are all so fond of.  Its really accessible too since its disguised as a fun
to read adventure in south america story.  Come to think of it, its not a bad
place to start if you wanted to introduce a non-raver to some of more
meaningful aspects of raving.
  
That said, I really hope the promoters of this party are truly into bringing
the wonderful insights of the Celestine Prophecy to their gatherings in some
meaningul way and aren't just latching onto "whatever the current new age fad
is"

   Here's the story -- I don't vouch for the facts, just the tale -->

   Since there are 420 chemical components to the cannabis plant, April 
20 (4/20) is the unofficial Marijuana Celebration Day.

And some people are mirrors, some people are diffraction gratings,

I've raved in Ibiza in 1988 (ok, it's not the UK, but there were plenty
of limeys raving there), and I got some pointers from some of the UK
folks to interesting places to check out in London (e.g. Spectrum,
Schoom (?? or something like that)) around that same time (summer '88).
It was fun, freaky, very different from anything I had dealt with
prior, including SF Clubland. But to tell you the truth, I enjoy the SF
rave scene more. Perhaps simply because I know a bunch of people in it
and it is more familiar to me, musically and socially. Basically, SF,
for me, has a better vibe, and it's more friendly. I didn't find
any of the eenglish ravers I met in London to be very friendly
or vibey...

So i'm sittin' here listening to Fraser Clark v The Irresistible
Force's War N' Peace (CND Edit) from "Give Peace A Dance Volume I"...
and I think I know and agree-with where Fraser's coming from when he
posts the things he posts... (i'm assuming they're the same, though the
CD I have spells the last name "Clarke"??).

Well, whether they're the same people or not, I agree with
either/both... I really don't know or understand why people are
hassling/dissing him on this list so much... 

If anything, this and coming generations need RC's (and I ain't talkin
cola either) big-picture expanded-mind-meets-reality-and-finds-a-god-
worth-woshipping-within-all-nature-man-beast-plant-and-art meme (gaian
if you must) to flourish if we are to survive....

Either that, or we can just party till we puke.

PS: If Clark and Clarke are different, well, uhhh... never mind....

they're one and the same, niels.  reporters often get the spellings wrong 
but I always tell them: "No E - unless you're offering."
thanks for words of encouragement - that record was made 4 years ago and 
I'm still being hassled (by *some*)  still, nobody said it would be easy, 
only that it would be fun.   fraser.

Don't forget to bring some extra clothes, deodorant, and a toothbrush for the 
morning. Putting on a clean pair of socks does wonders! A towel is also good 
so you can wash your face somewhere.

A student just gave me a copy of June 1995 ( I really hope I haven't skipped
2 months of real world living ) of Yoga Journal and on page 76 is an article 
titled "Sacred Raves"... fairly interesting reading but ..  PG warning: 
last 2/3 devoted to Fraser Clark ( spelled correctly ) and Matthew Fox(more).

Generally, I was glad to see raving get a more "optimistic" focus....

"These all night dance marathons look like hedonistic escape, but raves may
just be the defining spiritual expression of a new generation."

Talks about going to a SOMA warehouse ??? (artistic fact mixing here) 
because these quotes come up :

" I go to raves because I like to dance!" says Ronan Hollowell sitting in a
dimly lit corner of the warehouse where ravers are chilling out from the
dance floor on huge bean-bag chairs..... when he (Ronan) explains ...
" In American culture today kids are suffering from a disconnection from
their roots, their true identity. Ideally raves foreshadow an alternative
social organization, a model for exploring another level of consciousness."

Next paragraph:

  " A Chicano woman with long, dark hair and glitter speckled across her 
cheeks approaches me and politely introduces herself as if we were at a 
small- town church social. " Is this your first time at Friends and Family?
You know this isn't just a party. It's a community and subculture. It's
about taping into something greater than yourself."

 
Article goes on into some history of raves, introducing Fraser (photo)
and the zippies, megatripolis (sf) then into longest section on 9 o'clocks
and planetary mass of both Anglican church and Matthew Fox......

++++++++

So at least from one small published voice comes the image of the "rave" as
something other than "drugged crazed escapists"...... 

this will be an interesting summer  Yes ?

yes, here's a perfect example of how we can *initiate* things to get past
the potential bad press.  Yoga Journal may be small but it's *serious* 
and *intelligent* and likely to give a straighter reporter pause for 
thought.  I'd suggest we all get a copy of this article
and e-zap it off to any bad press that RC attracts over the summer.  it's
"Raving as Spiritual Exploration" - just the ammo we need.  

we have channel 7 (ABC) and japanese Esquire coming to this friday's
ChemicaSutra so maybe we'll get more good press for RC (and *some* will
slag me off again for something or other no doubt - ah well..) fraser >:-)

        Hi there, this is brad.  I know Jane (the promoter from Next
School) and not only does she beleive in the ideas contained within the
book, she wants to share them with others, but doesn't want to ram it down
their throat.  In a way, this is advertising for this book and, yeah, this
is a capitalist society in which thing are often turned into profit making
machines but i think that, for the most part, she is genuine about her
intentions.  She's the one that introduced me to the book and it's
definitely impacted my life a lot (though i still prefer the Tao Te Ching
which the book, among other eastern texts, has been an obvious influence on
the writing of the Celestine Prophecy.
        I think that she, as well as i, have realized that there are a lot
of ppl that have had their lives altered, if not outright CHANGED, by the
book and this is one way of giving it exposure to a group of ppl who'd be
appreciative of it.

        peace,
                brad

Bring a camera if you have one and a water bottle even if you have to dump it
out.  Chapstick is always fun too.   Also bring sunglasses for the morning
and something extra to keep warm with.  And of course don't forget your
nearest and dearests!

------- Forwarded Message

             RAVE CULTURE & THE END OF THE WORLD

Tuesday morning May 2, 1995     11:00 a.m. in the Roble Studio

          Presented by Friends of Dance at Stanford


Fraser Clark, psychologist and editor, is a social and political 
activist from Glasgow who is most widely known as the founder of the 
Zippy movement, Zen-Inspired Pronoia Professionals, an international 
community which resides primarily in the Internet, with a center in 
Clark*s London club Megatripolis. (Pronoia is the suspicion that others 
are conspiring to help you.) Mr. Clark not only promotes the continued 
spiritual evolution of individuals and communities, but is also an 
advocate for the primary physical expression of the Zippie movement, the 
all-night dances known as raves. 

Fraser Clark's eight-year involvement with raves includes the production 
of both small and massive raves around the world (including last year's 
Grand Canyon Mega Rave), the publication of three magazines on 
alternative lifestyles, the release of acid house singles with 
Timothy Leary, and the seminal house album "Shamanarchy In The UK" with 
the best of the technoshamanic bands, on his own record company. 

A year ago, Clark brought his philosophy, Megatripolis and the Parallel 
University to San Francisco, which he has adopted as his new home.

Mr. Clark will speak on the evolution of the rave culture, the current 
manifestations of this controversial lifestyle around the world, and the 
potential for positive change that an enlightened form of rave culture 
might contain.


This talk is free and open to the public.

Does anyone know the situation, whereabouts or any general info on INERTIA
which will be happening on the 22nd. ?
The flyer I obtained has a NYC phone # and an LA # (I have no desire to go to
either of thoese places for a rave...)

Also, anybody happen to know the US-dollar-to-UK-pound exchange rate?

Yeah, that crap.  I been meaning to post something about it.  I take 
a lot of the same herbals that go into herbal "e" on my own to just
stay awake and alert.  I decided to take the herbal "e" to see if it 
was any better.  I did feel a kind of rush that was reminicent of E
and not similar to the caffine or ephedrine rushes I'm use to.  It
was pleasant for about 30 mins.  For the next two days though, 
I experienced headaches, nausea, and depression.  

Not worth $18 bucks.  If you want to spend $18 on legal herbals,
try the super dieter "energy" pills or the like.  Take five of those 
and you'll feel a rush and won't feel like shit the next day.  
Guarana is also real nice, I swear sometimes it even makes the
music sound better, but then again it could just be me.

Take my comments with a grain of salt, your milage may 
vary.

just got back from butterfly at the casanova.  had never been before 
(what a shame - it's around the corner from my house!) and wanted to hear 
charlotte (the baroness) and dani.  REALLY NICE party - small, low-key, 
great dance floor, diverse crowd, good music/mixing (very house-y, not 
TOO deep, pretty trance-y) and a $2 cover.  think it goes til 2:00 but i 
could be mistaken.  anyway, it's every tues. at the casanova, valenica 
bet. 16 and 17th.  

one annoying thing, tho: after being at so many parties with 
(tobacco)smoke-free dance floors, i was pretty disturbed at and affected 
by the amount of smoke here.  but, it's a bar...

        I reccommend looking into getting some Ma Huang (which is a chinese
herb of natural Ephedra).  Look for it either in raw form or, even better,
in liquid tincture which is marketed under the name "ballistic."  Last
summer i tried this
for the first time and i just kept saying "I can't beleive this stuff is legal!"
Of course, the hugs you have to provide for youself but you do get a 'rush'
chills, mucho energy etc..all for $20 CAN for a 1 oz bottle (which lasts me
like 1-2 months of going out every weekend..)

        play safe :)

Hello,

I just picked up a new video "Pink Floyd - London '66/'67".

It is 30 minutes with the audio being from their very first studio session.

The video is partially also from that studio session (in sync with the audio)
and partially from the UFO Club in London,  arguably the first psych*d*lic
club ever (Perhaps Fraser was there, yes?).  Other parts of the video imagery
are from a 14 hour rave event, (using the term rave here in a larger sense).

The most remarkable part of the video is that it is crystal clear, both in
audio and video (naturally certain of the live scenes are dark, but so was
the room).

In fact, casual viewers might think the video was filmed recently, since the
fashions have come full circle since 1966.  For example, Roger Waters is
wearing those oval glasses that are all the rage now.

Someone who viewed the video with me said that it was now her favorite
depiction of being on L.

PS The video is an import, so it runs $27.  But, it probably can be rented at
good video places in the Bay Area.

Hello,

I keep seeing statements in posts like:

DDei>the dark lighting disturbed me somewhat (no eye contact with anyone).

In fact, Tristan's original post on F&F was critical of the eye contact
there, and another post about UK vs SF mentioned that a particular feature
of UK massives was eye contact.

However, I question whether this is really so important.

Perhaps, since the British are normally so reserved, then eye contact is 
deemed necessary to reassure one of trust and friendship.

Personally, I feel that a darker setting is more conducive to leaving behind
concerns with physical reality and trancing, which can only help the Vibe.

As evidence, I give you this sfr post from a year ago:

-----------------------------------------begin included message-------------

On June 20, 1994, Troy Sheets <tsheets@chaph.usc.edu> wrote:

Basics was simply the best event I have ever been to.  Basics seemed
to have a format, a program if you will.  It was not like a typical 
club where people come and go throughout the night.  Basics was
more like a service.  It had three distinct parts.  

Pat 1:  When I arrived I was a bit surprised that more people were 
not dancing.  But looking around I saw most of the people talking,
socializing, meeting up with friends and meeting new people.  
There seemed to be a feeling o knowing, of anticipation, maybe
the way a family might act before a wedding.  A feeling that everyone was
about to have a really good experience.  The music at
this point was a faster, progressive house.  

Part 2:  Large baners with fluorescent paint were lit up by many
blacklights up until this point.  At about 2:15am, when most people
had started dancing, the blacklights went out, the club fell into
darkness, and a large cheer came from the crowd.  Something was
happening.  The music changed.  I had heard this music a few times
before.  Nothing terribly different, just another step in the ever-
evolving realm of progressive dance tracks.  It was a bit darker,
trancier, almost pagan, but, amazingly, it retained funk and house
elements.  I guess this is "The San Francisco Sound", whatever
that means.  But this was, above all else, dance music.  This was
music that got me moving unlike anythig else I have really
heard.  My mind let go and my body took over.  
I'm not going to try and explain how I felt.  I thought how I would
explain this in a "xxxxxx-raves" post.  The one comment that
came to mind that seemed really appropriate was "dancing
with God".  I was in a state where I could not think of anything
that could possibly make this experience better.  A feeling that
everything within me and around me was in perfect balance.
I was not the only one.  The vibe around
me was unlike anything I have ever experienced, so much so that
the term "vibe" was totally redefined for me.  I could ramble on for
a long time about how I felt for the next 3 hours, but it is one of 
those things that you have to experience to really understand.

Part 3:  At around 4:45 the black-lights went back on, the DJ
poured on the House.  House spun just like I, personally, love it.
It was the perfect music to follow up what we had gone through.
The one word to describe the atmosphere was "celebration".  We
left our euphoric trances to share and dance with each other.
A more perfect sense of acceptance and co-existance I have
never flt.  We had experienced true joy for ourselves, and now it
was time to share it with the people around us.  Morning came,
and the club was over.

There is a either a new generation of raves ("Raves:TNG"?), or the
evolution has passed over Southern California.  Either way, there
is something happening out there, up here, that is wonderful.
I hope to see many so-cal friends visit up here soon!

went to see phead at the american legion hall in hollywood last nite.
  very weird show, included a short film called "to kill a dead man"

before the band took the stage, there was a guest dj on for about an hour,
  followed by the p'head dj, who warmed up the stage.

this band is kinda gloomy in overall sound, but they've got some really
  nice riffs and textures.

very artsy.

I also find that a dark setting can be more preferable at times, but I 
also like to have times when I can see the people I'm dancing with.
A darker setting sometimes helps me get more centered within myself.  
Once I'm more centered within myself, I'm more open to share that center 
with everyone else.  This is when I like to be able to see others more 
clearly and experiencing that sense of sharing to a greater extent.  
Probably why I usually experience a warm special feeling when the sun 
comes up and I can see the people I been dancing with all night.

Dear All;

	I have a love hate relationship with taggers, first the hate part,
it is vandalisum, destuction and deformationm of private/personal
property. It is someone "hurting" someone else in a very selfish,
negative, and egotistical way, no matter how you paint it, no pun
intended. This behaviour has no place in a scene that prides itself, on
love, tolerence, understanding, beauty & above all respect for self and
others. 

	On the other hand I remember the Michele Shocked song about the
graffito artist that was beated to death by the New York city transist
po-lice, and everytime I hear it, it still outrages me. Graffito can be
liberally viewed as a form of free speach. In countries where there is
much oppression, it is often the only safe way a common person can speak
out against the government.  Graffito can also be very beautiful,
especially when its done in the form of a mural. 

	I say that instead of fighting these things, that we provide a
space were these "artists" can express themselves without damaging or
hurting the image of our scene. Because realistically you can't stop them,
but if we provided a space for them to comfortablly express themselves,
the quality of their work will improve, due to the fact that they will not
have the fear of getting caught, and be able to do something meaningful,
we all can enjoy, and something that they can take pride in.  This would
not cost very much, it would validate them, and at the end of the night we
would have a beautiful collage. 

	It doesn't cost that much for some paper, a hard surface of some
type, and a few markers which would be returned to a person in charge of
collecting them, and giving them out, you could do something like take the
persons ID if they want a marker, and don't get it back until they return
the marker. I still say that we should check people at the door for paint
and markers, and strongly discourage this activity outsside of these
asigned areas. Also that we need to get the word out to people who attend
our events that taggers are causing our scene to lose all of the all ages
spaces, a simple flyer program, given out at the door I feel could reduce
the number/damage of incidents caused my taggers. 

	We must target the younger people, because I feel most older 
people don't partake in this type of behaviour. An ironically its the 
younger people who are really hurt by this behaviour ie Richmond Civic 
Center, just another all ages space that we no longer can enjoy. The 
promoters must let people know at the door that it there is graffito that 
we will not be allowed back, I think this will generate some positive 
pear pressure not to tag. Nuff said, anyone else have any ideas or 
positive comments/feelings they would like to share?

Peace & Love
Brian Darkness

yeah, ma huang is fun, but just be careful with it.  it can really work 
your immune system, particularly if you have a more "yin" constitution.  
also, it should not be taken with any MAO-inhibitor.  

from "The Way Of Herbs:"  ephedra is useful for asthma, bronchitis, 
coughs and other congestive conditions.  it should be used only for those 
with a yang constitution and are not deficient, as it is a strong 
stimulant that would debilitate the adrenals of one who is already 
exhausted and low in energy.  it is good for colds and flus and for those 
fevers that are without sweating.  ephedra increaes blood pressure, and 
therefore should not be used by people with hypertension.

mind you, i'm pretty sure i have a yin const., and i often use ephedra, 
but then only if i take some immune system boosters.

A group of us are planning on gathering this Saturday and we were wondering
if anything (party, gathering, happening, event, r**e) was going on
anywhere between Big Sur and San Francisco.

What more could we ask for on this wonderful day besides lots of sun,
smiling faces, warm embraces, steady basses, lots of races, commingling in
places, where nobody chases (us away)?

Please let us know!

Thanks,

FDA Warns Against Herb-Kola Nut Mix
-----------------------------------

Americans should not consume a dietary supplement that contains
the Chinese herb ma huang in combination with kola nut, the Food
and Drug Administration warned yesterday.

The FDA issued the warning after more than 100 reports of injuries
ranging from heart attacks to hepatitis -- and several deaths --
among people who ate the supplement "Nature's Nutrition Formula
One."

Proponents claim the supplement boosts energy and helps weight loss.
But the FDA said the cocktail of ephedrine, an amphetamine-like
chemical found in ma huang, and the caffeine from the kola nut
poses a danger even when the supplement is used as directed.

When Nature's Nutrition maker Alliance USA refused to recall the
product the FDA issued the consumer warning.  It urged people not
to buy or consume "Nature's Nutrition Formula One" if the
product lists both ma huang and kola nut as ingredients.

Alliance contended that the recall was not needed because that
version of the product is no longer on store shelves.  However,
the FDA received reports of sales last month, and noted that
customers may still have unused "Formula One" at home.

Alliance said it has changed the recipe of "Formula One," now
selling a supplement that contains only ma huang.  The FDA is
not warning against use of the reformulated "Formula One" product.
Consumers can tell the two versions apart by comparing the ingred-
ient lists.

The FDA will evaluate the safety of the new "Formula One" as part
of its review of all products that contain ma huang or ephedrine.

Land of the Giants - A Giant rave in Melbourne
==============================================

This last Wednesday,  I headed for Melbourne to visit some friends and take
in a rave on Thursday evening.

I left Sydney early Wednesday morning for a very long 12 hour bus ride to
Melbourne.   While on the bus,   I got a lot of programming done until my
batteries were almost drained on my Powerbook.   

I arrived in Melbourne about a half hour late,   but Martin met me and took
me over to visit some of his friends.   We chilled around for a while,  as
I had opportunity to check my Email and upload queued messages to the net.

Afterwards,   I went to yet another friends place to crash.   

Melbourne is sorta the cultural part of Australia,  with older buildings
having that European look.   Like Sydney,   its spread out and covers a
very large area.   The public transpo system usually has trolly cars
instead of trains.

I meet a few new AusRavers and eveentually head over to the rave,   but
didn't get there until about 12:30.   The rave is in this huge multi-story
warehouse and people were queuing up outside waiting to get in.

Eventually we get all our people together,   and I was able to get two
others on the guest list.    Inside,  downstairs  was the chill lounge
so we check it out first.   The downstair chill area had food
and clothes venders,  as well as other rave related goods.   

I headed upstairs for the main room,   which at the time was playing 
housey trancey stuff,  similar to the SF music.   I stashed my stuff 
near the vidio booth,  and headed out to the dance floor to warm up.   

I head immediatly for the main area and started to get down and
dance.   The vibe in Melboure was amazing,   got lots of smiles wearing my 
checkered hat.    Music was this trancey housey stuff,  not unlike the SF
scene except slightly faster (around 130 BPM or so).  The DJ actually played
the "Wink" laughing song,   but the mix was so seamless that it was halfway
through before I realized what he was playing.  Everyone literally went off,
yelling and screaming.   I think there is a lot more enthousiasm over here
in Australia,  then in SF.

Evetually decided to chill and scope the rest of the place out.    As I was
walking around,   much to my delight,  I discovered yet another room.    
So THIS was where the Hard Trance was located.    I immediatly got into 
the groove,  as the "Ekkie" started to take hold,   and was so intranced 
by the music that I couldn't even think of chilling.   I think I must 
have been dancing for about 3 1/2 hours before my body temperature got 
so high that I HAD to stop.   This must have been the highest trance state 
I've ever been since raving,   and dancing to the faster 160+ BPM's really 
makes a difference.    I only wish they have more of it in SF.  

All evening long,   I was dancing like there was no tommorrow,   getting a lot
of smiles and eye contact with these wonderful people in Melbourne.

As usual,  I get people coming up asking me where I'm from and how Old I am,
and get the usual disbelief when I tell them my age.   They were most eager 
to learn about the SF scene,  and really enjoyed talking to these great people.

I figured there must have been at least 2500 people at this rave,   and my 
friends remarked that it was the biggest rave seen in Melbourne for a very long
time.   The energy was awsome,   especally in the trance room,  which had mostly
Goa style German trance (Absolutly my favorite).   Later on,   the BPM's picked
up to about 200 + BPM and jungle music was played,  mixed in with some pretty
insane breakbeat.

As usual,   I went off BIG TIME,  and danced the entire Jungle/breakbeat
set non-stop.   How!! Jugle is so much DIFFERENT than the stuff they play in
SF.    It's hard to describe,  other then there are fewer breaks,   but when
the beats stop,   it's for a longer time.

When the next DJ went on,   who started playing the slower housier sound,
I left and took a much diserved break from dancing,  and stretched out in
the chill room,  schmoosing around with my friends.   The vibe was totally
insane...  Really high energy...   After taking a break from the german
techno,   which was almost a half hour,   I decided to check out the main
room again.

By this time,  the music in the main room started picking up,  and this wonderful
multi-colored lazer was blowing my mind with this amazing taste of "eye candy"
that really enhanced my visuals,  as I was chasing the lazer beams all over the
dance floor like a crazy idiot.   My energy level literally went off the scale
as I was boogie'ing around the dance floor.    Man!!  There was so much room to
move around.       

As morning approached,  my energy level picked up even more,   but as
I noticed not that meny people dancing,   I started urging the people on the
side lines to get up and dance.    I must have pulled up 20 - 30 more people
from the sidelnes and single handedly pumped in much more energy,  dispite
the slower BPM's.   All it took was eye contact,  a big grin and they would
dance harder.    People really responded when I made eye contact.

Then,  after about 2 more hours of solid un-interrupted dancing in the main
room,  chasing the lazer beams around the huge dance area,   I took another
break and headed outside for a while to cool off and get some fresh air.

I met my other Ausraver friends who were also hanging out,  and they mentioned
that this rave was one of the better raves they've seen in a while,   but
complained that the music was too slow.    I have to agree with that,  as I think
about 70% was mostly housey.   I was also told that the Melbourne scene was
more layed back,   and had less Happy Hardcore then Sydney.   In fact,  I heard
NO happy hard at this rave,  but that didn't mean they had none.

I told my AusRaveer friends I wanted to go in and dance some more,   and one
said "Already?".   I said "Sure!!  - gotta get down and do some serious dancing
some more!".    As I was heading upstairs (about 7 am) lots of people were leaving
but there was enough people to continue the good energy and vibe,  once I started
urging more people to get up and dance,   and danced yet another 2 more hours
until my friends finally pulled me off the dance floor and said "It's time to
go now"  

Totally hosed from dancing,  my AusRave hosts finally pursuaded me that
we should leave,   and was told that things would wind down at 10 am.    So
I reluctantly left with them,   with a big fat grin on my face.    WOW!! Land
of the Giants was one of the best raves I've been to since I came to Australia.

The promoters were most eager to meet me,  as word is spreadng all over Ausralia
about my being here.    The decore had these huge dinosaurs,  and other large
monster creatures all around.   I must say,  for a professional production,  it
had quite a good underground feel to it,   and the venue was huge,  although 
chillout opportunities weren't what I would think was adequate,   but if the
promoters would put in some good floor fans,   this rave would have to be
what I call "rave heaven".    Although no "happy Hardcore" which I'm told isn't
that well situated in Melbourne,  the German hard acid trance more than made up
for it.    So if you're ever in Melbourne and there is another "Land of the Giants"
scheduled,   I would recommend everyone to go.    I had a GREAT time,  an abundance
of energy,   and wonderful music and vibe.    I would have to give the following
score....

  Venue  - 7 (could have used some floor fans)
  Lighting - 9 (wonderful multi-color lazers and black light effects
  Music 8 - Could have been a tad harder
  Vibe  9 - really great,  got lots of smiles and gave out a lot of good energy

YES THEY ARE GREAT!  I understand they have some Trip-hop or dance remixes
that are VERY hot.  They play one song on 105 a lot... Nbody loves me... it's
true.. not like you do...  the rest of the album is much better imho.  Not as
many violins, more hamond organ, beat and even a little scratchin.  Also like
I said you may already be hearin them on tne dance floor.

dear sfravers,

oh, sunset was really wonderful again.  they had it out at a park on  the 
water in richmond, mondo-quirky bay area city.  and to my knowledge la 
police did not once appear.  what is the story with this park, does 
anybody know?  can we possibly have a late-night gathering there w/o 
attracting the notice of anyone who might want to hurt us or merely chase 
us away?

i love the sunset party so much!  this week, perhaps due to the proximity 
to marin, there were larger numbers than usual of marin-y people.  lots 
of awfully glamorous young men and women on E, for example.  my el 
cerrito youth posse tell me they can afford only L.  it's a social class 
thing, i guess.

solar and galen played the SH*T, the best sets i've heard yet from both 
of them, i think.  from the first minute, i was mesmerized.  

the digeridon't people were there, too- at least, there were some people 
playing long tubes.  it was an acoustic treat to be able to hear them in 
one ear and the system in the other ear.  they were cool.

the neatest thing about the  party for me was finally getting to 
re-experience force of one of the  ley lines  that connects marin with
the east bay. 

in case you're curious, one runs under the richmond bridge.  i think it must
make a detour to the park we were at, because there was definitely some 
serious energy going on.  everybody was so happy after a long weekend of 
play play play.  

love,

ann

Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian...

First of all, let me compliment you on your musical literacy. However the
song, Graffiti Limbo (from 1988's brilliant Short Sharp Shocked), was NOT
glorifying tagging. The song mourned the excessive brutality of the NYPD, and
the clear racial bias demonstrated by the police. The event, graffiti, could
really have been anything...an African American driving through a
predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, etc.

Now, I do agree that tagging can be an expression of free speech, and, in the
best cases, an artistic expression. But you are more than a wee bit over
romantic in your view of tagging. On a day-to-day level, tagging is just
that...the marking of something, mostly territory by rival gangs.
Unfortunately it is more often an act of hubris than an artistic expression.
So your solution of organized tagging would not attract the negative element
that both you and I deplore.

The truly artistic graffiti artists, many times, are donated garage doors or
empty walls by sympathetic members of the community. Unfortunately, the press
covers such artistic expressions most often in the wake of a senseless crime,
where a member of the victim's family or friends create a brilliant work of
graffiti to commemorate the deceased.

Spend a week in good ol' NYC and take the subway into the Bronx. You'll see
the unfortunate reality of what I'm saying.

Peace to you and all in SFRAVESland,

hello everybody!

well, the new moon is coming up on april 28, and although we have lots of 
ideas about various (renegade) outdoor locations, we are as yet sound 
system-less.

we are as of this time a loose, but warm, collective of friends and 
aquaintances who just like getting together to DANCE and also chill out 
to both hipswiveling house and chilled out ambient, with all the 
gradations in between.  some of my personal fave highlights  of the party 
over the last year include:

(1) tracy ameba's relentlessly energized house music set at the Bolinas 
Mystery School, January 1995. (sound by Pacific, Ronan)

(2) charles uzzel-edwards, bryce and darkhorse ambient stylings at an 
underwater atlantis location in the lower haight, november, '94. (sound
by Bryce, aka MetroVision)

(3) hard trance and italian lessons at the chateau in berkeley, after we 
were chased away from pt reyes.  this was ronan's first dj appearance in 
sf, as i recall.  (correct me if i'm wrong!), july, '94 (sound by MESS, 
MetroVision)

(4) and finally, scott hardkiss' legendary dark side of the moon/sympathy 
for the devil set, followed by Galen of Pacific's Iron DJ set,  on the 
beach at goat rock, a mere three 
hours after glen and heather's new moon wedding. (sound by Pacific) 

anyway, we're not too proud to beg...so if YOU would like to get a little 
sandy, perhaps, or maybe not, pluuleeze give me a call.  also, if you 
have the elements of a system, but not the whole thing, pluuleeze give me 
a call.  we may just kinda piece together what we can and rent the rest.  

the new moon is about music and love and lotsa other cool things and the 
planet is expecting us to do something!  and we certainly cannot afford 
to disappoint Her...she's been awfully patient with us thus far.

if you want to get involved, want directions to the party, or just want 
to put in your evolved two cents,

please do.

love, 

ann

I have and then some, I helped redesign/retrofit the FL9-AC Locomotives for 
Metro-North and The Long Island Railroad, silly New Yorker, and as of 1.5 
years ago was a New Yorker.

Sorry(sincerely) for my smug sarcusum, but your response reaks of it, and 
I'm in a bad mood, and it got under my skin.

I was part of the biggest sound system in Britain up until 1992.  We 
organized parties where at least 2,000 people would show up every week.  
We orgasnized the world's first totally free sound circus where we had 
20,000 people for the whole weekend; all illegal and all totally free.
We played music similer to what they played at "Universe" (see Ameba 
music shop for tapes).  In England we have really good E and people take 
a lot of it and that is all they take so vibes at raves are a lot more 
intense and has rougher edges then in SF.  Your average raver there is 
much more together and knowledgable then over here.  He is older, knows 
all the tunes that he is hearing and can shove an amount of E down there 
throats that would put most people around here in hospital.  In short, 
it's all a lot more hardcore over there.  And that is bassically because 
your average raver there is poor and unemployed, not rich, middle-class 
and white like they are around here.  Also, over there your basic 17 year 
old is much more clued in anyway.  In short, the whole scene over here is 
about five years behind (don't think that this is the best choice of 
word's) and will never get to be as good as London because the whole scene 
here is to small.  In London one could go out every night and never hear 
the same dj twice but that is impossible to do in SF.
I could go on and on and on so what else do you want to know?  But take 
it from me: London kicks arse over SF any day.

U-ziq is playing this Sat. 4/22 as part of the Ambient Jungle Boat Party. 
Tickets are available at Housewares for $25. It is kind of pricey but it 
ain't cheap renting a boat and there are only 200 tix or so available.

Craig the promoter has tried hard to produce interesting gigs and it is 
rumored that he would like to bring over System 7 if he thought he wasn't 
going to lose a lot of money.

Jonah, Nick Philip and some other good people are playing also. Should be 
a worthwhile show if you've got the cash.

Thanx for alerting me to this article. I remember speaking with the author 
sometime last fall. She did a good job transcribing my words. She was 
truly interested in preseting a positive and insightful position on rave 
culture though she wasn't that familiar with it.

Now for some self promo. I will be publishing an article next month in 
Creation Spirituality Magazine entitled "Raves,Spirituality & the 
Re-birth of Celebration". I  can e-mail a copy of it to people who are 
interested.

This is the mag associated with Matt Fox. Though I consider my-self post 
denominational and not affiliated with any specific religion I will say 
that I am in general agreement with Matt's work. He is one of the most 
open-minded, non-dogmatic and visionary Christian's around.

Hope we can all live a life of celebration and love!

C-YA,
ronan

Tagging has more in common with dogs pissing on trees than it does with 
graffiti art. Barring the few in SF with any redeeming aesthetic merit 
(Probe/Prohibiscus, the early Mr. Element, the running dogs, &c), it's just 
a load of disrespectful homogenous crap waiting to be sniffed and 
overwritten by the next tagger happening by.

Carmen and I started decorating our black and white Valiant three years 
ago with quotes, sayings and pictures that meant something to us. But 
sure enough, nearly every event we went to had us driving home with the 
stank of unwanted tags over our own work. After a couple years of regular 
paint-overs and touch-ups, we finally gave up.

Your suggestions are appreciated Brian, but it's never going to go away 
so easily (I've seen pictures of ancient Pompeiian graffiti). We may walk 
on two legs, but we're still as territorial as nearly any other species. 
And there will always be those without the brains or guts to make a name 
for themselves anywhere other than someone else's garage door.

If you've got the cash, *definitely* come see this show. Mu-ziq wanted to 
come and play at the Blackdog show but wasn't able to make it until this 
weekend. If the dog were any indication, this show will be amazing. These 
are Big Deals(tm). Both the dog and Mu-ziq have come across the ocean for 
one show only. Lucky for us they both wanted their first US shows to be in 
San Francisco. If the promoters and groups see our support, were sure to 
see more incredible events like these in the future.

In the meantime, I'm praying nightly for Reload or LFO to come next (tho 
System 7 would surely get my attention).

You know, I promised myself not to respond to Tristan's interminable
patronizing of the SF scene, but his comparison of the UK and SF situations
needs some additional context.

Sure the scene in the UK is different and in some respects may be considered
better . . . but I wonder.  

A brief look at a recent issue of DJ magazine, the flagship of the UK scene,
gives you the flavor of what's happening there.  The scene has turned
relentlessly commercial, and is starting to take on some of the Hollyweird
aspects that rock did in the States in the mid-1970s, when Rolling Stone
stopped being a hippie rag and decided it was cooler to hang out with
the millionaires.  

Here we have a feature on DJ Graham Gold, with three KISS FM slots and
director of the Peach label which is part of the club/house PWL empire.
The feature is a diary of a Day in the Life, and here's one entry:
"12.30 pm.  We pile into Graham's black BMW with its personal plate.
'It's tax deductible' he explains.  Amongst the demo tapes on the floor
in the back is Map Of Britain and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles book.
As he reverses full speed back up The Vineyard the phone rings.  'Stupid
cow, I won't be able to drop it off today...'  As we screech across
London he says excitedly 'I'm going scuba diving in Israel next week,
I've been doing a course because I've never been there before.  Apparently
there's a rave scene out there, the Es are 30 pounds each..."

So there's a leading light of your precious UK scene.  All props to those
who maintain the underground and keep it moving and even make ends meet
while not succumbing to the flash lifestyle.

For the punters, it's 10 pounds in the door Friday, shite Es, the Drug
Squad everywhere, CJA killing off all the true undergrounds, and all
the rest.  It's like the US indie rock scene, except the sound is house.

But the money and the greed are the same.

I salute the UK underground, it must be tough keeping going with all that
heavy weight overhead.  We're very fortunate in SF and America in general
not to have that to contend with.  I saw what can happen.  Grunge was
really invented at the Satyricon club here in Portland, not ten blocks
from where I sit.  For years it grew and maintained within our little
Northwest context, suddenly it blew up with Nirvana and all the rest,
and here we are, none the better for it really.  I don't want that to
happen to the house/techno/r**e scene, like it already has in the UK.

Peace out.

Some people think the scene here in California is growing "at warp speed" 
and will lead, very soon, to the beginning of an RC Revolution.  True or
not, I am curious as to how the RC Revolution is progressing in the UK.  
I.e., how has the more widespread and advanced state of raving over there 
influenced UK society for the better?

I think there is a definite difference between graffiti artists and 
taggers. there are a ton of good, talented, decent (ie they won't do a 
piece on your house) graffiti artists. Taggers, frankly, suck. I could go 
on and on - for a more concrete example - take a trip on the N Judah 
through the Duboce Tunnel - the tunnel itself is gorgeous, with some 
amazing art in it, but when you get to the outskirts of the tunnel at the 
entrances, all it is are really really weak tags, which my tax money is 
used for to paint over. 

Another example: In baltimore, there is a rave 
promoter there named Lonnie Fisher, he runs the Ultraworld crew with 
others...Ultraworld are *fantastic* guys, completely in it for the music 
and the whole of the scene, started as ravers themselves and now throw 
some of the best parties on the east coast - a perfect example of Doing 
It For The Right Reasons, And Doing It Right. Last summer Ultraworld 
threw a big one at an outdoor resort, 4-5,000 people showed up and had a 
*blast*, a magnificent time. tickets were reasonably priced at around $20 
and noone noticed because they had such a good time. Now, when an 
Ultraworld party makes money, it goes into a fund to do *more* Ultraworld 
parties...the promotors haven't gotten any fatter off their scene. You'd 
think with 5,000 they'd have made a profit. But did they? nope - the 
tagging damage done to the buildings and bathrooms, fixtures, 
everything...ran into the thousands of dollars. *thousands*. What kind of 
respect is that? So, Brian...i think i agree with you on this one...i 
just think that one needs to make definite the line between tagging and 
graffiti artists.

I've got some friends in Australia who are artists...and the city council 
where they live (Adelaide) actually put up huge blank billboards along 
the side of motorways for the artists to fill up - a bold statement i 
think, and a good one. Alot of parties on the east coast will have paper 
up covering the walls, so taggers can tag all they want - at the end of 
tthe night, you just rip all the paper down and viola - no damage. Most 
east coast parties will just confiscate markers, though...

well, enough of my rambling. you all get the point. :D

I don't know about that- I think California has a very diverse amount of 
cultures- With individual music tastes that more then often reflect the 
social and race orientation of that group. England does not have the large 
amount of cultural diversity that we do- If RC in California is to launch 
anything resembling what the UK has- It will have to appeal to many more 
different types of cultures and in our day and age in California it is very 
difficult to get people to drop their prejudice behaviour and join large 
groups of diverse people. Unless they are shopping in a mall together or 
something- And even then take a look around at people that are of a different 
race then you and count the smile to anger face ratio!

-->Public spaces do exist in most big cities around the country, provided in 
the hope that it will deter illegal writing. Check out the walls in the lots 
around 
Franklin in Market sometime. I understand these are 'legal' walls, and they 
have some pretty good works on them.  Sure, alot of writers are idiots lacking 
respect and common sense about where to write, but the real ones deserve some 
respect for creating in an artform that escapes traditional gallery/$$$ 
bullshit....

i really don't think it was poor and unemplyed ravers going to those 20 
quid parties.  undergrounds, yes.  also, please remember that not ALL 
ravers here are wealthy or middle-class and white, altho' the majority 
may be.  

furthermore, while i DID see a thriving underground there, i also saw 
hell of crass commercialism all over the place.

I totally respect your opinion about uk raves. But why does the emphasis 
on E-taking such a prerequisite for a good rave? Perhaps I don't know 
enough about origins, but music is my first incentive (it's evolutionary)
--I studied classical music pretty hardcore and this is the first 
contemporary  stuff that reaches the same level of sophistication--second 
is the people (curious, individual, and unpredictable, and definitely 
coming from different backgrounds) and  well, E is always the same. I 
guess i don't insist on as many prerequisites. Everyone has their own 
reasons for why they participate. I do agree that single-minded intensity 
probably does not exist to the same degree as a result. To me, the 
intensity is more individual. (sorry, i'm so hung up on this 
individuality thing and how everything is very personal) As much as I 
love drugs, it is only one path to "intensity". I see a passionate 
violinist get up on stage and perform the Brahms Violin Concerto, and see 
the "knowledgable" audience get wrapped up, and see the violinist go off 
stage sweating like a pig in his tux. I'm not trying to illustrate the 
pompous rich life, I'm just trying to say: people, music, great minds of 
music, intensity. oh, passion too. 
I always love running into ravers that "know their stuff" but if it makes 
someone happy for some unnameable reason, I've got to respect that.

KK: In short,

Are uk raves a greater release? I mean, you seem to think that the 
quality of raving there is a result of STRUGGLE. So are the raves to get 
away from the struggle, or to express it? And I wonder, are sfraves more 
white because of exclusivity or because other ethnic groups simply like 
other kinds of music (hiphop, acid jazz, plain ol' rock)? I've noticed in 
NYC, it is more mixed, even tho' they advertise in such a way to ward out 
stereotypical gangs and such. And all my hip hop friends simply "don't 
like techno and all that cr*p!" And they don't like the "drugginess," 
they want to have a "couple beers and get down on the dance floor."

cheers,  eugenie

>From the Miami herald:
Ernie, of Sesame St. fame, currently in a legal brouhaha in Argentina,
negotiating the terms of his return, is in big trouble. Already under
scrutiny by the Interpol and the DEA, due to various drug charges, he is
recovering from a harrowing kidnapping by the Whining Path. But there is
more, and he seems to have been an unwitting pawn a blistering ploy by
terrorists, in an Fleming-esque international espionage crisis worthy of a
James Bond tale.

His escape seems, apparently, to have been a carefully orchestrated ploy by
various terrorist groups. Apparently, while unconscious, the Whining Path
inserted into one of Ernie's molars a microfilm of the federal building, as
was discovered early this sunday when he suffered an absess and went to the
dentist, who x-rayed his teeth. The film was discovered and removed, but
The CIA/FBI apparently felt it was a hoax and did not respond to his plea
for swift action.

It seems that the terrorists hoped Ernie would return to his east coast
barrio, and there he would recaptured by other terrorists and the tooth
removed in a mock mugging. Ernie, however, was under enourmous pressure, as
the DEA was already on his heels. He fled to Argentina instead.

Currently treating a case of the clap, contracted on Victor's floating
casino, Ernie said that as a sesame st. actor, he is often not taken
seriously and that the FBI contact felt that he was only trying to buy into
amnesty with "this absurd plan." CIA agents O.P.Ress and Knot Surv said in
a press conference today that they could not take Ernie's story as true.
"he's a schizophrenic, due to long term drug use. You can't rust him. He
may come up next month with a story about the japanese gas attacks!" But
Big Bird, in an exclusive phone interview, said that this was
insensitive,untrue, "an outright lie. Ernie may have his excesses, but he
has never been unstable. We  have our differences, but I know he's a good
man." Bert backed him up on this one: "a real good one" said the yellow
house mate and Jesse Helms target. 

Ernie, wearing his trade-mark "kill Barney" tee, and sipping a beer, was
seen on the deck of the floating pleasure palace by media hounds and fans.
He waved a "V for victory" sign and gave the crowds a thumbs-up. But for
many, the only thing up are eyebrows around the world, as many wonder if
the US government refused to follow his passionate plea this sunday, and
averting disaster.

I went to crash worship, after hearing dave talk about it so much, and
there he was, nude, flailing his meat in frenzied ecstasy with eyes rolling
yelling "I am the lizard king!"

oops! The above was just a typo! 
heheheee!

Actually, half thru the night I finally recognized someone (minuk) and he
was shirtless and mildly slimey, but I was a fuchia mess! Blood and
chocalate and oil and one big smile, I haven't danced this much since new
years and i had a frenzied time, heard turned up and my arms in the air,
awesome percussion and confusuision, firecrackers and udder confusion :)

Never miss this, folks.....and thanks Dave, I never would have gone if you
hadn't told me. Truley a tribal experience.

To: sfraves@hyperreal.com

Tagging is wrong.   There is NO excuse for it.  Tagging has no socially 
redeeming value as it shows a blatant disregard for other people and
their property.  When I hear about or see taggings at raves I just have 
to shake my head because it is so hypocritical.  Tagging simply runs
counter to everything that RC has grown to mean (e.g., peace, love, and
harmony).  It's sort of like writing an email that says "you're an
irrelevant piece of garbage" and concluding it with "Peace and Hugs."

I guess what bothers me most is that tagging destroys the beauty of our 
habitat.  There is nothing worse than waking up, especially after an
excellent night of dancing, to see the outside of the building you live 
in covered with tags.  BTW, cleaning off tags are a great way to spend a
cold Sunday afternoon in SF.  I don't wantonly deface my (or others') 
property or neighborhood.  I don't want anyone else to either.  I'm sure
our friendly taggers would be more than a little upset if I tagged their
property (home, car, 49ers jacket, and so on).  What has happened to the
golden rule?????

Someone in an earlier posting to SFR mentioned that dogs (or maybe it was
animals in general, I can't remember) pee to mark their territory.  They
used this as an anology for tags.  Good point, but the fact is that dogs
are driven by primal instincts and not capable of higher order reasoning.
 I'm sure that most taggers are smarter than animals (but maybe not!)
and, therefore, they know right from wrong.  They simply don't care.  

What to do about tagging?  That's a toughie because it is indicative of a
larger social and political problem.  Tagging is just one step in a
vicious, degenerative cycle.  The cleaning of tags steals money from 
other programs that endeavor to break that cycle such as education, job 
training, or maybe even art programs that help taggers develop their
artistic potential.  As a volunteer for the SF School district, I can
say that the schools need every penny they can get their hands on.  It's 
really bad.  I wish I could spend more than five hours a week at the
school.

I don't believe governments should spend tax money to put up walls or
billboards as a way of letting taggers perform their craft in a less
harmful way.  Murals are different.  Murals are art and readily 
distinguishable from tags (which are not art).  Perhaps Singapore's
approach isn't so far off the mark?  I'm wondering if Michael Faye is 
still into in tagging?

Hey All,

Just got word that the Guardian is starting a local network, and they 
need beta testers to help them wok out the bugs.

Looks like a good system. All graphical, icons, the works.

The plan is to archive the Guardian from now on so ANY article from 
past issues can be researched quickly.

Their big deal is conferences. They want as much chatter as possible to 
be going on so a local community of people can be created, discuss local 
issues, inform each other of local events, situations, etc.

Send a note stating your interest to :	info@sfbayguardian.com

and they'll tell ya what to do.


Don't mean to sound selective, but they do want Bay Area people as 
testers, though perhaps you can persuade them if your out of the area.

This network might be a nice way to the "integration" thing with 
other like minded people in the area.  

Should be interesting. Later...

-Jonas

Why would they just be native to the british isles?
In fact I took a class on this very same subject.  There are some
powerful leys that run through Mt. Tam but the one that you can
most easily experience is the one that runs through the "golden gate" and
passes through the "tower" at UCB, check it out.

Hey check this out!

I was sitting here watching CNN after taking a shower. They were doing a
story on SHEITE MUSLIMS(SP) and lo-and-behold, there is ernie way in the
backround. He was for sure in cognito. He grew a beard and had downed a
white full cloth indicative of the middle east for clothing.

When the camera crew zoomed in on him he opened his cloth and revealed a
shirt with the quote:

                         BOMB SUDDAM

Although his attire and new found facial hair seamed to keep him
disguised very well, distinguishing marks were his halfmoon ears and
that toothless-clothy gumline of his. After he flashed the camera some
shots were fired and he fled to the sandbags.

I called and talked to JANE PAULY-SHORE. They are trying to do a
recovery-computer graft on the footage to see what food he had sticking
to his mouth. This will give them a clue as to where he has been in the
last week. That is, if someone didn't first wash,spin,rinse, and cycle
him. I asked PAULY-SHORE if he (ernie) had been linked to the terrorist
bombing in OK. The reply:" With advances in computer and
telecommunications, anything is possible. Heck even my 13 year old son
can do his homework now without even getting out of bed. Our world is
changing. The better we get with communicating orur problems and solving
them, the worse the crimes can become."

I then proceeded to try and contact Milton of the "Militia Of Ernie" but
my RJ11 analyzer beeped and showed that his phone was tapped. I
imediately hung up in fear of the FBI.

I know ernie would never do anything to harm anyone. I also know that
none of his discedents(SP) would either. If anyone knows how to contact
him. Please do for I fear for his saftey, and the security of all our
activities.

if capital punishment doesn't stop murder, do you really think caning will
stop tagging?  get real.  if you think you have an answer, fine.    if you
care so much, why don't you make an attempt to understand why people do
what they do instead of making generalizations like "it's counter to
everything RC has come to mean".   RC means a lot of different things to a
lot of different people,  after counting yourself in maybe you should count
in others too.    is caning along the lines of  what "RC has come to mean",
as far as you're concerned?  is judgement/punishment Singapore style
something you'd like to contribute to the RC culture that "means" so much
to you?

what are you talking about exactly?

 all you seem to be saying is that you don't like taggers  and you don't
understand tagging.  that's a long way from doing something about it or
understanding what a solution might be.

Jim,
I appreciate your comments but I think you should go back and read my
posting again.  You're right in that I don't like tagging.  Tagging is
a form of vandalism and is wholly unproductive.  I am, however, very
openminded so if you can provide a convincing explanation of its
virtues I'd be interested.

I do have a pretty good sense of what tagging is all about.  So your 
assessment of my ignorance or lack of awareness is unfounded.  I also
have a good sense of social issues and priorities.  I can see the
homeless, the poor state of public education, the inadequate and 
overburdened medical services available to those with limited or no 
financial resources, etc.  In fact I *do* *more* than just observe it
and hypothesize about reasons why these things have come to pass and
ponder possible solutions.  I am involved in community service projects.

Frankly, I have spent alot of time cleaning up after taggers and I am
tired of it.  Every time someone has to clean tags from a school, a
muni bus, a library, or even the building you live in, it takes away
valuable time (and money) that could be used for more productive 
purposes.  That's an undeniable fact!

As for the solution, I indicated in my first posting that it is a 
tough problem that can't be solved without addressing some broader 
issues.  I could easily argue both sides of the capital punishment 
issue and Singapore's approach to crime.  Singapore's solution
works for Singapore because of its unique circumstances (culture, 
government, size, etc.).  I am pretty certain it is not extensible to 
the US.  My comment was intended to be more ironic than serious.  I 
don't think we should put a bandaid on the problem by creating places 
where taggers can perform their "art" with impunity.  It not only sets 
a false expectation for the way the real world works but it does
nothing to resolve the problem.

Finally, regarding tagging and RC.  I agree that RC means different
things to different people.  My comment was not an indictment of the
entire RC (sorry if it came across that way). I was just commenting on a
contradiction that occurs periodically within the rave community.  Are
these types of contradictions unique to the rave community?  No.  But
that doesn't they're not worth talking about.  It's, in fact, more
important to talk about this type of issue you are interested in
perpetuating your philosophy or attitude.  For example, in the course 
of discussing how the internet will (or is) changing society, then it
is probably worthwhile to talk about how it promotes anti-social 
behavior; a fundamental contradiction of what the internet is supposed
to be about (i.e., uniting people without regard to geographical 
location).  An instance of how anti-social behavior is emerging as a
result of the internet is that people are more aggressive in their
communications when using impersonal mediums such as email; much more
so than they would be when communicating face-to-face.  I mean, if you 
were speaking to someone in person, would you tell them (especially if
someone you don't know) to ridicule their beliefs and tell them "get
real?"

Here some final info on KIVA that might help you all make up your mind:

It'll be all ages, 10pm - 7 am, $10, at a permitted East Bay location 
about 15 minutes from the Bay Bridge, with MESS DJs, Tony, and Dubtribe, 
and a healthy breakfast served in the morning! :)

Call 415.487.7681 or 510.549.6260 Sat. evening for exact directions.

In honor of Mother Earth (and Earth Day :) this party is intended as a 
healing ceremony for our ailing Mother, and the more individual energies 
we can combine and focus in this endeavor, who knows what we may 
accomplish!  Hope to see you there!

Respect,

Hi everyone:
About my recent, um, UK vs. SF post...I didn't mean to start arguments about
the transatlantic rave differences, and sure, there is a difference between
the two, I'm sure, and all I wanted to find out was what those differences
were.  Thanks to Saira for her thought-out reply and everyone else who mailed
me and posted, and I can assure you all that I had no underlying intention
of implying that SF was inferior by perhaps being physically slower.  I am in
love with this delicious collection of gatherings around the bay--don't 
forget that!  
Thanks to all, again, and if any of you go to KIVA (or I might be at Progress,
actually...haven't decided) tomorrow and you see a brown-haired kid with 
a pacifier in his gob, that's me!
Bye (wave)

influenced UK society for the better?

Well, I just saw a British TV program last night where some characters go to
a very mild, pre-1987 style dance club and the word "rave" was used to
describe it.

Sounds similar to $300 "grunge" shirts in the US.

Well, there's a Steel Pulse song from uhhh... like '79-'82 called
"Ravers" --- goes something like "sounds called ravers, got you craving
for more..." (ps: the song kix).

This could establish historical precedent for raves, or it could imply
that eeeeeenglish people have used the word "rave" a lot prior to the
advent of raves.

There's a 1966/67 record from the YardBirds called "Having a Rave Up".
Maybe this is a UK term for a kickin' party? (I know there are some
experts out there :) About the time of the original Mr. Floppy's no one 
that I knew who went called it a rave, but maybe they hadn't clue'd in on 
the lingo...

I can now tell you where it was, as it was last night and this morning.  
Now it continues within me, as well as for those that were there.
I made the trip down with a friend toward bonnie doon.  After a bit of a 
search, we found the secluded beach underneath a sky full of stars.
There weren't many people at this party, which I found to be a nice 
change, because I felt I got to know everyone there.  On arrival I handed 
out lollipops to everyone and I recieved a very warm response  from 
everyone I approached.  With the warmth of this small intimate party on 
a  beautiful 
beach I found it easy to let loose and feel that sense that when I danced 
I shared the feelings that we all had.  The beat of the music and the 
sensations of the beautiful surroundings took me to a sense of 
enlightenment that let me feel extreme joy as I allowed myself 
to let go and dance with no inhibitions. 
After the music was done, it was nice to bask in the afterglow on the beach 
with  the remaining ravers.  It was nice to get to talk to some people 
I've seen on the dance floor from past partys.  
After grabbing some brunch in santa cruz and checking out some of the 
sights, headed back to sf to rest a bit before the boat party.
In closing I want to say that I had a great, great time, and I still am.  
For those of you going out tonight, enjoy that groove, and where ever we 
are we will be there together.  That goes for those of you not going out 
tonight as well.

Man, we're all sitting here in Berkeley waiting for the KIVA line to be updated
and we're getting the unpleasant initiation that all ravers experience at some
point: sometimes, I guess, promoters forget to update the message line, and
some raves just don't happen or get shut down or just suck.  *sigh* but as
you need downswings to make upswings noticeablr, I guess this will just make
the next rave I go to that much better, since it will be compared to tonight.
Hopefully, the rave will happen, I guess, but it seems a little late to this
newcomer to the scene.  Oh well.
Anyone go to Progress?  Some people at my house got back from there after
staying for about ten minutes, and then leaving because it was lame...but, as
Vincent Vega said in Pulp Fiction, "That's just what I heard." 
Well, I had all this energy bundled up inside me, ready for an amazing night,
but I can't use it, so I send it through these fiberoptic wires to all of you
in equal-sized and carefully-wrapped packages.  Swallow it down, smear it across
your bodies, and enjoy!
Hopefully everybody had a better evening than me,
Timothy

Phred, you are totally correct in what you say.  I have not lived in 
England for two years.  But even when I lived there their was always this 
element of mainstream v. underground.  I was only ever involved in the 
underground scene.  But what ever side of the UK dance scene you are 
looking at one thing is true that was not true when I was working in the 
scene: it's now all run by black gangsters called Yardies who are evil 
corrupt people.  I hope the same fate does not befall the scene in SF.
     And, as any self-respecting UK raver will tell you, anybody that now 
works for KISS FM and thinks that this is cool is nothing but a complete 
wanker anyway.
See ya! Love Tristan.

Any scene that results in a Government passing laws where it is illegal 
for anybody to gather together in groups of ten and where the right of 
silent upon being arrested by the cops is seen as admission of guilt can 
only have been a scene that was getting so big and fundemental that it 
scared the British Governemnt into taking this action.  Can one ever 
imagine the same thing happening over here?  I think not.
Anyway: nuff said on this subject.  See ya! Love Tristan.

It was poor unemployed people going to 20 quid parties.  Why do you think 
te underground scene in England got so big so quickly?

Sure Timothy, there is a big difference between SF and UK.  In the UK the 
whole underground scene is being run by poor unemployed classes people.  
In SF it's all being run by cynical English ex-pats or young white trash 
kids who have not got a clue.  Guess which one has more authenticity going 
for it?

 wouldn't the poor unemployed class peopl in the uk (most of them white i 
bet) also be called white trash?  so what's the difference if the white 
trash over there is better than over here as you seem to be implying? why 
is your white trash more authentic?

I've avoided this issue, even though I predicted before xmas that Raving
and Tagging would be the 2 big social issues ths summer.  the reason for
avoidance was pretty much to not make big threads that not eveybody would
want to go int. however, now that we've largely taken the heavier RC stuff
of-line, sfraves seems to me to be suffereing a lack of rlevance and
interest to anyone interested in more than "dancing and hugging". so hre
goes. the reason I thought these 2 issues would be lrge this summer is
that, as with RC, urban grafitti (as I prefer to call it) is about the
suppressed imagination and creativity busting out of an overcontrolled
culture). in NY where this stuff has gone much much further it often
seemed to me as if, every night, a whole wave of peoples' imaginations
would flood up from the cellars of the culture and spread itself to a
height of 7 feet across the whole city. 

none of it is selling anything - Art Unchained?  a healthy dose of it is
quite political.  undeveloped egos were getting a chance to address the
public (and be listend to?) and much of the "art" is quite good.  I'm 
absolutely certain that this school of art will be recognised in a few 
years and even actual walls (or fotos certianly) will be on sale in fancy 
Manhattan galleries.

art is revolutionary.  it should *always* offend the powers that be.

one last point, especially for Bradley who seems an intelligent, 
fair-minded chap:  perhaps you have fallen for the official Unholy Roman 
Empire hype that large expanses of boring, deadly grey concrete somehow 
sums up the mightiness of our armed forces and multinationals and must 
therefore be accepted as "Beauty"?  NOT!  those large aonymous planes of 
concrete *should* inspire rebellion, rather than passive acceptance and 
apathy (I mean if there are to be only 2 choices).

personally I definitely view grafitti as healthy signs that the human spirit 
is not yet smothered to death beneath grey concrete planes. it might piss 
me off if I had to clean them up every time - but do we?  actually?  why 
is the "brochure" look better than when adorned with some real people 
creativity?

I think the most ironic aspect of Tristan's post is the use of the word 
'cynical,' especially when the adjective is directed as an insult, but at
the same time, it perfectly captures the tone of Tristan's paragraph.

Hmmmmm.....

the Rave Spirit is wild, involves more sponataneity, it allows more
craziness and "possession" and so on.  I noticed very clearly how RC was
affecting the UK culture a few years ago when I noticed that I was having
no problems taking my dog (unleashed as always throughout its life but
that's a whole other story, probably not related to sfraves, althoug she 
attended as many raves as some people on here!) onto the bus, and just 
generally, at cafe tables, crossing the equivalent of Market St etc
.  
when I thought about it I realised what had been happening and later
noticed many similar examples.  RC was spilling more"craziness" out into
the streets of the surrounding superculture.  until it got to a point that
there was just so much lovely human diversity and craziness everywehre
that authoritarian personalities who feel its their duty to stomp out such
things had ben forced to give up.
that's also my reason to people who worry too much about government 
surveillance and so on.  the only real answer is to spread this new 
tolerant, cooperative culture so widely that all their equipment becomes 
useless since they don't have the manpower to even *observe* their 
findings, let alone *do* anything about it.

and, as usual, RC seems to be pivotal in playing this "seeding" role.

Despite many early setbacks (unavailable generator, voicemail crash), 
Lawndree Went Off in Davis last night. The party cost only a quarter and 
was outdoors and went till sunrise. At its peak ouround 1 am, there were 
over 100 people dancing in the oak grove. DJs were Marcone (me), Jeyson, 
Glowboy and surprise guest DJs Pepe and Tom (I hope I got your names right), 
who showed up with crates and proceeded 
to tag-team out a excellent deep house set. This, combined with my 
eclectic trip-hop/acid/conga house set and Jeyson's hard acid and jungle 
sets gave the mixed crowd all sorts of wonderful music to dance to. The 
crowd varied from ravers to local punk-band members. At oround 4am all 
that were left were about 5 breakdancers, maybe 10 raver types, and three 
drunk alumni that had been wandering around playing golf in the dark and 
had heard the thump of the speakers and decided to hang out and dance 
with us for a while. As the sun rose the remaining few 
were treated to a beautiful ambient set by Glowboy. The lighting varied 
throughout the night from the glow of the stars and rising crescent moon 
to an acid bubble light projected on hanging parachutes. 
In summary, we had an incredible party. Everyone loved the location and 
the low cost. The mostly unknown DJs (though you might have seen Jeyson 
spin at F&F) provided great, enegetic sets. There were no bad vibes and 
everybody got along like they were old friends, sharing water and food.
Everyone was incredibly cooperative with parking  somewhere else and 
walking in. We are so amazed that the party went so well that I can 
hardly express it.
 And we didn't get busted.  :)
 
Marc

got to disagree on this one, kevin.  indeed I'd say from some of the 
stuff we've been hearing about authroty actions nationwide, and some of 
the bad press, that RC must *already* be starting to discombobulate a 
few people who feel they have something to lose from society changing. 
 (they're wrong, they'd be much happier, but try telling someone who's 
never been how good a rave will be!) 
I mean, when you compare reactions to the first zippy warnings last year 
over the Criminal Justice Act to, at most, a discomforted silence and 
general agreement today it's pretty clear.  (and this is whether you 
agree it's a good thing or not.)

Only two weeks away for the biggest little party in Portland. I had too
much fun for myself up there last time so we decided to have a little
caravan. Anyone interested in a weekend getaway please write back if you
are interest in going. The trip will include a van ride up to portland
>from sacramento. It may include a room to stay at but I'm not sure. We
would leave Fri may 5 early morning and come back sunday night. If
anyone has the slightest chance on going I highly recomend it. Seating
is limited so please get a hold of me in advance. I will be the one who
is driving(I'm a really good driver and I'm really good at finding my
way around portland(shut up Milton:)). I'll be driving up a 12 passenger
van and 5 spots are already taken. The people in portland are very nice,
kindof reminds me of the closeness I feel with the people I know in the
city but with perfect strangers! The "SCENE" is different there but very
dancy. I like the "new look" about the scene up there. Drop me a note if
your are interested!

LOVE FOR ALL, ALL FOR LOVE!

i sent this to my friend david and realized it might make some extra
happiness if i posted it; this is the sort of stuff that keeps me reading
this list.  all about people and beauty and lovE!  hope you enjoy.

*****

david i know i've said this before but i want to say it again:  thank you
so incredibly for everything you've given (me) this past year!  this
trajectory i'm on was largely instigated by your brilliant examplEmpathy
and your guidance and love continues to push great shit through.  last
night i felt for (almost?) the first time that i was giving back some of
the wondErful lovE i've received from everyone here; the kids i drove home
thanked me so much for providing the lovEmpathy and i said "don't thank
me!" and they said "we *are* thanking you!" and i said "it's not me" and
they said "yes it is!".  funny, so i'm learning to feel good about giving
and being recognized for giving.  and how i receive so much by giving that
it feels hardly worth commendation, you know?  the kiva party (w/dubtribe)
didn't happen so i went to Progress which turned out to be really kickin';
i had my second mind-blowing WOW experience (the first was with the doc
w/you & brandy) during john howard's set; i was absolutely transfixed,
fucking incredible.  the feeling is like being disintegrated by the music,
like a zillion acupuncturist's needles running me through at once, one for
every cell in my body, and each cell reunited with the air/earth/fire/water
all around.  the WOW is really like the WOW of the Transcendent Other in
the psychedelic experience, of any ecstatic experience, i suppose.  like
"Ahhh, --here--we--are--!"  we are now HERE.  the nutrition of the
situation is so deep, i continue to be amazed.  and i continue to be amazed
at how amazed i am by the entirE Environment, i mean the insanely bEautiful
hills, bridges, trees, faces, birdsongs, white breakers (went to Progress
afterparty at ocean beach today!), gorgeous sUn, deep surgical bass, tribal
groups that promote these things (Pacific, Friends & Family, Cloud Factory,
Harmony, Mother Earth Sound System, etc.), i'm so overwhelmed by the depth,
breadth, stunning bEauty and wisdom of it all, it's like having a continual
ecstatic expEriencE as long as i can avoid the concerns about myself as
individual, i.e. a thing to be marketed, protected, possessive (of things
as well as people), a consumer, loyal to god and country.  helen wonders
how i can feel good about having this stuff as the focus of my energy and
work; it seems so "unproductive", i'm not writing, i'm not sculpting, i'm
not creating.  but here's my take:  just a day or two ago i started
thinking of all this as my current work, and what i'm working on/creating
(collaboratively with the comE/unity) is a new piEce of art to transcend
all artworks, one whose components are human consciousnesses and
lovEsources, and this is happening on many levels:  global (species), local
and everywhere in between.  i'm sure someone has pointed this out before,
but in addition to these raves being TAZes, they are like mandalas made of
sand; transcendently gorgeous and Eternal works of "art" which are created
collaboratively with great lovE and comE/unity and then returned to the sea
rather than placed on display in someone's living room; a dynamic thing,
not static like western art.  wow, i feel like i just hit on another little
profundity; the way we make art in the modern western world as an attempt
to stop the world, solidify something essentially ethereal, the brilliance
of lifEforcE.  so the ultimate "art" is an endlessly morphing culturE of
lovE, and we are all making it together!  cool.

My comments to a recent post ...
( Anybody on SFRaves who has graffiti and/or tagging experience, I'd
appreciate hearing from you via personal email ... )

 From the beginning of this post , there is a problem with terminology
that may make the rest of the post irrelevent to "tagging". The term 
tagging is the practice of leaving personal trademarks ( "tags" ) 
symbolizing the tagger or a group the tagger is advertising. It is a
subset of the whole world of graffiti.  Compared to the beautiful , rude,
colorful graffiti which is most obviously an example of "Art Unchained" ,
tagging is a minimal , monochrome , selfish statement which sole purpose
is to say "here I was/we were" .   
 I must say that there is a echo of calligraphy in tagging , as taggers
probably practice a long time to develop a unique yet readable (?) tag.
However , I prefer my graffiti with more pictorial elements in it .
And the artistic aspects of their tags seem to be the last element in
the minds of taggers.

 I can't quote any showings or books from memory , but good graffiti has been
recognized as such - most public libraries should have at least one  
book from the 1980's about the subject , when the interest in the more
pituresque version of graffiti peaked here in the United States.

 Hmmm - it'd be nice to see references that document the connection between
"large expanses of boring, deadly grey concrete" and "mightiness of our armed 
forces" . There is a definite connection between the look of a building
and the amount of narcissism the building's would-be owners have. Look at
the TransAmerica Pyramid. It seems the bigger the corporate ego, the 
wilder and less boring the building design. 

 Actually all that gray concrete probably has more to do with it being
cheaper than large expanses of painted concrete. The look of corporate 
USA has at lot to do with the collision of the dreams of architects crashing
against the customer's budget. 

> those large aonymous planes of 
> concrete *should* inspire rebellion, rather than passive acceptance and 
> apathy (I mean if there are to be only 2 choices).

 However ... tagging is mostly done in locations where other taggers can see 
the tags  - including neighborhood "mom and pop" grocery stores , delivery
trucks, library walls , fences , and ( most annoying to me ) art murals 
created by local artists. Tagging as an offensive act against the territorial
asperations of other gangs is carried out in the neighborhood of the
enemy - these are the folks that are probably defacing the art murals. 
If in "neutral" territory , tags are purely advertisement.

 Ironically, tagging is rarely seen on gray , corporate buildings , because 
zoning laws seperate these buildings from the homes and schools and libraries
that mostly catch the worst of tagging. 

 Any grafitti done on billboards ( except public service bill boards ) usually
gets some anti-advertisement approval on my part - maximum points if the 
grafitti actually comments on original advertisement.

hmmm...awfully odd that someone supposedly so conscious of class issues 
would use the derogatory term "white trash" to describe american kids 
from poor backgrounds....

and odd that someone who obviously has no clue about the many different

Some "alternate" opinons follow - the only excuse I can give ahead of time
is that I'm on antihistamines and feel a sore throat coming on ... :-) 

 Raves as AntiSocial Selfish Rudeness

 I appreciate the beauty of a great vibe when it blossoms and spreads like
a fire flower - I've felt blessed to see the sun rise and set with the 
beat of techno/house moving my body and soul. I say this up front to 
try to establish to you folks that I like raves ....

 Raves are not the salvation of the nation or the world - that's my opinion.
They may be the salvation of sub-sets of the USA or the world. But if you
find yourself screwing somebody over to get yourself raving , don't use
the higher purpose of "Rave Culture == Soul Salvation/Cure for Modern
Civilization" as an excuse. 

 So far as I know , I've never broken into a place to hold or attend a
rave, and I'm proud of it. Bent some laws - sure , but I never concioussly
wanted to rave if doing so would screw up someone's right to a decent 
night's sleep . Other things I would never want to do is trash the land
and property of others for the purpose of raving.  

 We've heard the "ends justify the means" line before , and most of us
wouldn't accept it as a valid excuse in a non-rave context , so why do
so in a rave context?

 I feel like writing more along this vein , but can't get the ideas and 
words to align here on screen via my keyboard. I will appreciate any 
comments on what I've already written here ...

Another point I wanted to bring up in my "raves as Antisocial Selfish
Rudeness" post was that RC should be humble enough to co-exist with 
other "ways of life" - tolerance should go from ravers to the world
in the same amount that we want the world to tolerate us. And - maybe
the more antisocial aspects of raves ( tresspass , property damage , 
noise pollution  ) should be modified or transformed in order to
form " a more perfect union" ???

Something happened to me that hit me really hard.....have you ever just 
*known* that you were with the right person - trusted them with your 
soul, shared every little thing in your life with him or her, had a 
blissful dream of always being together and most of all *loving* them in 
the most pure and undiluted form that can be possible - then to have it 
severed instantly?  How do you deal with it?  I am in such a state of 
shock right now and thank god I have my inner strength and incredible 
positive energy continuously flowing around me and through me thanks to 
my incredible friends.  But I have to unsubscribe to this list for 
awhile to get myself back together - I know I don't post all that 
often, but I consider you all my friends, and I don't leave without 
saying goodbye.  I'm strong, I'll be back in full force soon enough, 
but I need this time to heal myself.  If any of you still wish contact 
with me, my email address is below and I'll get into contact with you.  
I will definately be at Sunset this Sunday if it's happening, and 
probably Wicked in May.  Thanks for listening.

with much PLUR,
Amy

hmmm.  in the valley of the blind, the guy with the large sound system is
KING! but you might run into continuous problems with yur light shows.
what I'm trying to say is that, if you take the view that we live in a
*seriously* repressed and almost somnolent culture, then you'll be
continuously running afoul of a whole plethora of laws which have no moral
standing at all but are just more or less the side-effects of general
intolerance.  I don't know exactly how things are here, but I do know in
England, as the System runs down, huge areas of formerly industrial bdgs
can lie vacant for years as they crumble.  not because the owners don't
care (many of them would *love* to hire them out) but becuse zoning laws
and all the rest of it won't allow anything to happen there.  meanwhile
thousands of ravers (for example) who just want somehwere to dance can
find nowhere legal.  so what to do in this situation?  the most famous
rave in history was at Castlemorton in England a few years ago.  and you
shaould have read the press that said it was antisocial.  complete with
interviews with people living nearby who couldn't sleep all weekend.  then
I did some enquiries.  and it turned out that Castlemorton is actually
"public land"  meaning that the king had granted them in perpetuity to the
people for the holding of fayres etc.  but a few yuppy types (4 I think )
had managed to fiddle the local rules and had managed to build private
houses on the common land.  and it was *they* who were doing all the
complaining!  they had 360 days a year to live on "our" land but when we 
poor city types came once a year to party they complain like crazy.
now, to bring things home a bit:  if ravers were allowed to hold raves on 
common land here - after all we pay for its upkeep - there might be less 
reason for using warehouses or even keeping some poor wage slave awake 
for once in his lifetime (why not just join in with the ravers, eh?  
would that really be so bad?) 
so before we start talking about tolerance let's be more sure how much 
tolerance the overculture is giving us.  which is as close to zero as it 
can make it!  with a lot worse to come as RC expands.
or should the concentration camp prisoners have been more "polite and 
tolerant" to the wage-slave guards as they were led to the incinerators?

I dunno who you're quoting here but I'd like to correct it anyway.  I am 
certainly not saying that the ends justify the means.  a Rave *is* the 
end.  in a slightly more sane culture young people (and older ones too, 
like in an unrepressed place like Africa, say) would do a lot more 
dancing.  and a sane culture would encourage it by making lots of space 
available.  why the hell NOT??!!
so I doubt if anyone's putting that case forward.  such a case might 
involve killing someone to bring about peace.  VERY UNLIKELY!  but that's 
not my argument.  I defend *some* rule-bending from an inner conviction 
that such things would be allowed and enouraged by a sane culture and so 
we're only doing what should be allowed in the first place anyway.
fraser.

We put up 37 pictures of our journey to Friends and Family VI on our web
pages that can be accessed directly by the following URL:
http://arts.ucsc.edu/Random/Matt/pictures/fandf/fandfskipb.html
or thru our home page at:

in a couple of days there should be captions at the direct URL listed above
the list that is now numbers if you view should be names and some brief
descriptions in the next couple days.  If you have any additions to the
captions please be sure to send them in.  If anyone sees their photo and
does not wish to have it on the web please tell us because we tried to get
permission from everyone possible but the nature of a few of the group
shots leaves us without the oppotunity to ask those we don't know.  Sorry
but most of the shots are of setup but I managed to get shots of several of
the djs that played and most of the shots are of people you might
recognize.  check it out if you got web access!

For those who are still confused about Kiva, I have some
information, although perhaps an official Mother Earth Sound
System representative can say more.  After losing their site,
they looked desperately for a new site, and after considering
all the options and their desire to make this party happen,
they decided to try a break in.  An old warehouse going unused...
Ethical issues aside, some police noticed some activity and found
what was going on as they were setting up, and a small number of
people were arrested and put in jail for, I assume, breaking
and entering.  As far as I know these people will be in jail
until thursday, or until $10,000 bail each is posted, and then
they will have to deal with the charges.  So, obviously, the
party didn't happen.  Whether these people deserved this or not
is up to you... regardless of that, the Mother Earth Sound 
System could use all our support and love right now.  We can
also be thankful that the bust didn't happen after the party
was already going, as a lot more people could've been arrested
or many confused people would've suddenly have had to deal with
getting home, similar to the problems after Friends and Family.  
Do the ends always justify the means?
It's a very difficult question.  We need to be very much aware
that as much as we beleive in our cause and the goodness of
our love, there is a whole other side to the world out there
that demands our responsibility and awareness.  We won't change
them overnight and we can't simply ignore them.
But we can't stop beleiving, either.

My love to all,
and wishes for an ever improving tommorow.

-john.

ps.  I had hell of a lot of fun at Organic on Friday.
good sound... *grin*

Hi everybody!
Guess what I did last night?  Well, okay, 2 nights ago I was supposed to go
to KIVA with a bunch of friends, but when the party fell through, I was kind
of bummed, so my roommate Niki and I and her friend Kelly went to Larry
Blake's in Berkeley, which is a bar/r&b club, and we went to dance.  We
got downstairs to watch the band, which was playing some jazz/freeform/hip-hop
fusion stuff, and the crowd was extremely chill.  Grad students sitting at
smoky tables, sipping beer, frat guys with their arms crossed, leaning against
walls, etc.  No one was dancing at all, even though there was a space for it
in front of the stage.  Determined to spread the vibE, we told the singer to
tell people to get up and dance, and he was excited by our energy and made
an announcement.  Nothing happened.  Then the trumpet player came over to
our table and told us to dance, so we did!  Just the three of us at first,
but as we jammed others started doing it too... then I broke out my blow pops,
and started passing those around the club.  People were a little taken aback at first, but it was heartwarming to see their faces light up when they got offered
candy.  Then I unwrapped a package of stickers, and slapped them on all the
very grateful bandmembers as they played, and on the dancers, too!
Soon we were all having a fabulous time, and everyone there seemed to be
fasci9nated by our limitless energy.  A couple of tourists from 'dee-own undah'
(sydney, I think it was) asked what we were doing, and I said, 'you ever been
to a rave-up?' and then they realized what we were doing!  OHHHH! they said...
and then they caught the good vibes too.  Try this sometime, you guys!
Pick a non-ravey environment and enjoy the challenge of introducing the fun
that we all know so well.  If the daylight people won't come to raves, well,
then take the rave to them.

Stickers and blowpops to ya,
Timothy

Yeah, well it should have made you nervous.   

4-24-95 Los Angeles Times 
            Bomb information on the internet sets off debate

Only hours after the bomb that shook America, someone posted instructions 
for a repeat performance on the Internet.

It was all there--even a diagram: Mix two widely available chemicals, 
slap on a "booster," attach a detonater, and almost anyone can have a 
bomb like the one being callled the deadliest in U.S. history.

"Democratization and dissemination of the techniques of terrorism," says 
University of Southern California terrorism expert Richard Hrair 
Dekmejian, "is going to breed more violence."

So if you enjoy the right to free speech, you might want to give a fling

going to roar through congress like a fire through a haystack, most 
likely will assign someone to watch out for our ilk with loose lips.

For a look at taggging & bombing & piecing and other urban art forms,
check out the book "Bomb the Suburbs" by Upski.  He's a guy who grew up
in downtown Chicago, deeply rooted in hip-hop & graffiti culture.  It's
a good look at many aspects of inner city life.

Actually, could anyone who knows anything about this please post/email it 
to me?  I've heard a few things and would LOVE to head down for it, but 
don't know much except it's a big party out in the desert (?) near the 
end of the summer (again: ?)  Any info would be appreciated...

Yeesss, Burning Man.  I sure hope to see some quality rave action out there

this year.  The setting couldn't be more perfect (except for having to protect

your equipment from the dust).   They have an excelent web page with a survival

subpage which would a way for any one who wants to take a system out to contact

them.  Check it out.  http://www.well.com/user/tcircus/Burnman/index.html

*** Pure Space
I went to this long running Thursday night party
for the first time a week or two ago.  Also, made it to
the 1 Year anniversary where everything was more expensive
instead of cheaper.  The Sound Factory isn't as bad as one
might gather from rumor and secondhand party chat.  It does
seem thoroughly 'imitation' - the decor, I suppose.  The 
soundsystem is kinda brutal in spots.  Despite any of
this minor stuff, I had a great time.  Lotsa fun 
cute people at this party.  In fact, (and this is
hard to explain) both the dj's and the people here
made for some moments that were very True.

a Ringing feeling.  
one touched - body, mind, and soul.

I wonder what it takes for this to happen?  (how innocent)
I'm reminded of a flamboyant and extremely energetic aquaintance
of mine who, at a small house party, expressed his desire "to give".
Charitable and greatly entertaining.  I think, maybe, any
further elaboration might somehow spoil it all.


*** Eighth House
In all honesty, I kinda avoided this club.  I'm not sure why.
Just going on my instinct.  Anyway, my friends' momentum carried
me there last Thursday.  It was nice.  Sorta what I expected.
On the brainy side of things.  Music and people.  Very social at
the same time.  I could see this kinda club being potentially
sinister - but perhaps not in San Francisco.  If anything, the
people were in complete contrast to the subvert and mutate 
Overtones.  Any of you twitchy acid trance popcorn types 
shouldn't miss out on the dancing that starts up later in 
the evening.  The music is good (and I'm told) quite
hard to find in this town.


*** DV8
I went to some URB party in the basement of DV8.  Dubtribe 
played and they were pretty good.  (They were *really* good at
the 4 yr CU party awhile back)  Anyway, the party was ok.  The
basement is nice.  But, having never been to this nightclub
before, I really wanted to check it all out.  The sfdisco
party was completely separate and I was only allowed to 
look thru some doors into the first floor room.

As luck would have it, I got invited to "Dwight's birthday party"
this Saturday.  Dwight is a semi-famous hairdresser at some posh salon
in the city.  This got me on the guest list and into a private party
held on the second floor.  So many enclaves.  Inner sanctums.  How
many velvet ropes, elevators, doorman, and secret passwords must 
I shuffle thru before feeling Completely and Totally Swank?  Aaahhh,
granted access to the innermost private room with complimentary 
Oysters.  I have Arrived!  Under the false impression that there was
also supposed to be a Diva Fashion Show I was a little disappointed
that my friends and I were among the most dressed up.  Again, this was 
minor and momentary as I now had access to the entire club.  Well ...
anyway, happy birthday Dwight!  Thanks for the invitation.


*** that Sex Party (zippie fundraiser)
I am aware of at least two people who went there and, of course,
had sex.  Now I also recall some people having sex at one of those Evolution
parties awhile back.  And a few weeks before that there was a couple not
so discretely occupying themselves in the basement of 1015.  What is 
the story here?  Also, I met a guy who chomped down an entire Yohimbe
root (no mere extract punch for him) and he claimed to have had a
hard-on for 36 hours straight.  There is no moral to this story.

I just hooked in to the list today (Monday).  If there has been anything about
the party Sat. night that was posted over the last day and a half (and is still
floating around) can you please send a copy to me so I forward it to the right
people.
---------------------------------------------------
Personal opinion:  Incredible... Krista's set (from Montreal) was screamin'...
great crowd, perfect vibe, Gold Ganesha on the table in front of the DJ... Can't
wait for the second insight...

This Year BURNING MAN will be the Shit!

That's all that needs to be said, don't think about going,
don't talk about going, don't postulate
the possibility
just do whatever you have to
to be there.

I just ran across this tagger related URL.  It seems to be and ad for
the "National Graffiti Information Network".  Typical of these "insider"
people, they have very little real information.  Take a look at the gifs
of the various groups they claim to be experts on for examples.

 I know of one pagan who is organizing an effort to buy land within a
few hour's drive of the San Francisco Bay area , for the purpose of 
having a communally owned site for pagan observances and rituals. Has
this been considered by the Northern California rave community?

 Has this idea been tried in other parts of the USA?

 Has this idea been tried in Britian? How do the new laws affect the
holding of raves on private property , with the permission/participation
of the land owner?

[ Never get Larry Ching on downers or antihistamines ... he gets sappy 
  and posts strange things ...]

( I want to say ahead of time that when I made my original posts, I had 
  not read about the KIVA folks getting arrested for doing a break-in. I hope 
  they don't get charged too hard for it. )

 This is a combination followup on my recent posts about raves' antisocial 
 aspects.

Fraser Clark described the warehouse situation in England :

 A nice by-product of industrial decay - too bad the empty warehouses around 
here have too many working warehouses ( with security guards ) nearby. 

 A lot of raves' problems with the surrounding human environment come
from not having a true space to be .

 I said:
> ...<I've> bent some laws - sure , but I never concioussly
> wanted to rave if doing so would screw up someone's right to a decent
> night's sleep . Other things I would never want to do is trash the land

To which Fraser replied:
> ... if ravers were allowed to hold raves on
> common land here - after all we pay for its upkeep - there might be less
> reason for using warehouses or even keeping some poor wage slave awake
> for once in his lifetime (why not just join in with the ravers, eh?
> would that really be so bad?)

I know that Fraser actually wishes all the best for our Hypothetical Would-Be
Sleeper ( HWBS).  I hope that the vast majority of SFRavers wishes our HWBS
the best too, and would be pleased if HWBS came to dance.
However, let's imagine the possibilities  for what kind of person the HWBS 
 is -

1. An able-bodied wage slave who could possibly tell a convincing tale 
   of illness over the phone to the boss the next day - most likely to be 
   able to join us.
2. A farmer who put in a hard day's work and will do the same tomorrow.
3. A soul with bad memories of disco who hates any music with a beat. Will
    definitely call the cops on us.
4. Some obnoxious assault-gun toting neo-nazi survivalist hiding out in the 
   woods ( yikes! ).
5. A performer ( artistic or otherwise ) who needs their sleep to give the 
   best possible performance the next day.  Due to fatigue on the performer's 
   part, our rave results in a sub-par performance , harming the performer 
   and the audience.
6. A severly ill person who needs their sleep - so , our rave is acting to 
   shorten their life.
7. A true wage-SLAVE who needs the $$ the job brings. This unfortunate 
   situation can arise for various reasons ( legal debts , family obligations 
   , the medical needs of others , etc. ) , but it's a sure bet that our 
   rave next door holds no direct solution to his problem  - can we give him 
   the alertness he needs to do the job he NEEDS to be at the next day, after 
   we've vandalized his sleep?

 I think that most of the folks I list above have a right to a good night's 
sleep - who are we to take it away from HWBS ?

[ by the way - just for fun , imagine all the above persons as male , then
  female. Does it change/affect your point of view ? ] 

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

When I talked about ends NOT justifying the means -
>  We've heard the "ends justify the means" line before , and most of us
> wouldn't accept it as a valid excuse in a non-rave context , so why do
> so in a rave context?

  ... I wasn't refering to anything Fraser Clark said, nor was I consciously 
refering to any one person here on SFRaves. I think it was an extreme phrase 
to use in the context of holding and attending raves.

 My point , however overstated , remains - can we as ravers use the "justi-
fication" of being victims if/when we victimize others in pursuit of the vibe?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Back to my antihistamine haze ...

Yes. But it is my opinion that we live in an ultimately just and good
universe, where love is not unrewarded.
Sometimes, one has to allow the tides to change, so perspective can be
gained on what it is that you value.

  How do you deal with it?

You nurture yourself, and learn to allow the universe to love you. then
when you are feeling good again, and in tune, without a need for another in
your life, love and all that warm fuzzy stuff settles quietly on your
shoulder.


a good rule - follow your bliss

hope this helps

Larry says he's having trouble getting the ideas and the typing to align,

I know I'm in a small minority on this, and I know my opinion has even
less value since I haven't been to Burning Man myself, but my honest
view of it is that the desert deserves more respect than this event
basically allows.

I need back-up on this one people!

Has anyone noticed anything really weird going on. I've noticed it since
Friday and this feeling won't leave me alone. I can't pipoint it on one
event. I don't think I could.

It's a real funky fealling, like the Karma bank is bouncing luck checks.
Or maybe the planets are off sync. I know we are changing Astrological
signs this week. I feel as if something is out of place. If anyone is
feeling the same please write, I need to know. I yelled at my boss today
for a really stupid reasons. I had a pretty bad day today. I can shake
the day off my shoulders but I still have some residue left.

thanx

as far as I understand the new CJA (Criminal Justice Act) in the UK such
decisions are now in the hands of the police who can go right over the
head of the owner. an attempt was made some time back to buy a parcel of
land and divide it up into square meters, each held by a different "owner"
so that a rave or festival could move from one "site" to the other. 
sounded good intheory, not sure if cops are "interested" in such fine
points. fraser.

not to worry, with the system dissolving at its current speed half the 
working warehouses you refer to should be unemployed by the time this

or think of it this way.  what is democracy about?  how about the cop in

it's "*we*" who are being (quite consciously in most cases) victimised.  
the HWBS is *not* being victimised in this sense ie nobody consciously 
*sets out* to keep others awake.  it's just that there's so little space 
in the city and they won't let us take it to the country.  maybe we 
should just stay home and watch TV like they want us to?

AND, Larry, I'd like to see you construct a List of Ten Ravers whose
entire lives might be changed by holding the rave.  maybe some of them
will even help the poor HWBS change hir life some time later - mysterious
ways indeed, Hir wonders to perform.

total nonsense!  we're talking of a square mile at most of, what, several 
hundred thousand square miles of desert.  now Desert Storm is a whole 
other matter. (and every record you bought this year, phred, helped *pay* 
for that)

the press (a few hostile idiots) used this on us last year, namely raving 
in the forest squashed the grass.  my answer then and now is:  how the 
hell are urban kids ever going to learn to app[reciate our natural 
resources if they don't get out there to experience them?  and if urban 
kids don't start appreciating nature soon the *real* urban hooligans will 
have finished polluting the oceans, the atmosphere, aand will probably 
have "tagged" the city till it looks like a manic blackboard jungle on 
acid (besides big the only jungle we have left!)

sorry, phred, but this sort of nitpicking really infuriates me.  for a 
moment.  >:-)

PS  we've been invited to help organise a festi-rave on the weekend 
following the Rainbow Gathering in Taos, New Mexico (peaks on July 4th) 
where we shall also be doing a small but intense rave like last year at 
the Rainbow Gathering in Wyoming (where I first met the Crunchman - see 
you there again, cap'n?)  it'll be in the same area so there will be 2 
wonderful festi-raves in the same week, say between July 2nd and July 
10th? more on this as the facts coalesce.  bring a tent and p[repare for 
wilderness survival but the true meaning of Zippy is Rainbow Raver and 
there's nothing the world needs more right now than a coming-together of 
these two cultural strains.

I'm inviting you here and now, phred, to come play with us at the Rainbow 
GatherRave.  then, if you still feel as you do about the Burning Man, 
well ....

Is that for you to decide??  You don't have to live his life - he does!

Fraser>so before we start talking about tolerance let's be more sure how much

tolerance the overculture is giving us.  which is as close to zero as it 
can make it!  with a lot worse to come as RC expands.

I'm sorry, but such things as "the overculture" only exist in mail messages.
Ultimately, society is just people.  If you're not making an effort to treat
people
with love and respect, regardless of their actions, then that is not RC.

Fraser>or should the concentration camp prisoners have been more "polite and 
tolerant" to the wage-slave guards as they were led to the incinerators?

Absolutely (assuming that they were not going to escape, either way).   And
doing
so gives then gives the guards something to think about....

I'm starting to become a bit leery of your declaring an emergency (ie world
to end soon),
 because it seems to lead to declaring a sort of "martial law", the ends
justify the means, etc.

Sounds too close to the viewpoints of those who perpetrated Wednesday
morning's tragedy.

Fred,

Absolutely the desert deserves respect and MOST desert areas would not
allow the burning man event... but the area they have it in is actually an
ancient salt lake flat... imagine an area flat and basically devoid of 
plants for miles and miles.... of course, this does absolutely nothing to
hold down the dust...

  At first I had imagined the event in the "typical" desert area where the
impact of hundreds of people would be devastating on the plant life ( some
cactii only grow less than 1" per year so knocking down an 8" cactus could
be destroying a 10+ year old growth effort ). The actual area is basically
a no growth area since the soil is so hard and mineralized.

  The Cacaphony Society put this event on ( it started with the first burning
man on a beach near SF some 10 years or so ago ). They are a great bunch
of "alternative types" and do such events as Kill Your TV and the SF
sewer walk ( in formal attire and sneakers ). I videoed the Kill Your TV this
Fall ( the TV killing segment I have shown at F&F's ) and may very well
attend and video the Burning Man over Labor Day... it's a very unique and
pagan event - and the Cacaphony Soc. are definitely not trying to be 
disrespectful to the desert any more than ravers celebrating with loud music
on a beach are being disrespectful to nature. Although some people would
say disrupting the quiet of nature is disrespect :-)

I had this concern last year but the event is very kind to the desert.
I stayed through Tues. to help with the clean up and basically all that was
left was a few scorched areas in the playa. (The playa is 400 square miles
of dry alkaline lake bed which contains no life except what we bring - not 
even micro-organisms.)

The energy there is intense and very primal.  I think one of the reasons the
playa is there is for events and spiritual happenings like this.

I also have to agree with fraser on the eye opening this event does for many
as to the beauty and wonder of the desert and the need to perserve it.  (Many 
people who are into saving the trees and rivers aren't as concerned about the
desert as they buy into the barren wasteland theory.)

The price is $30, with $5 off it's $25.  Very well worth it, as it's 3 days of
incredible events in a mindblowing setting.  (You can show up earlier and stay

It's really a dry lake bed. *absolutely* nothing there for miles and
miles. And the organizers do their best to "leave the place as they
found it", which is absolutely barren and lifeless.  I can agree 
that deserts have some delicate balance systems, but this one has already
lost the war... there is no balance remaining as best as I could tell.

One could also say that by going to this desolate place.. 
and living there for a few days..
one pays it respect.

I hope that you, un-like me, were fortunate enough not to be at Porgress 
on Saturday night.  Despite a good set from Mark Farina this was with out 
a doubt the most badly organized party I think that I have ever been to 
in SF.  There was no chill-out room and all the deco and effects looked 
like they had been bought at safeway.  They also were well into their 
philosophy tip to the p[point where you got bombarded with new way of 
thinking weather you wanted to or not.  If you feel you have to think a 
a certain way in order to enjoy a party and the organizer's also take this 
attitude then they are looking to exclude rather then include and, to me, 
this defeats the whole purpose as to why one throws parties in the first 
place.
If you need help on how to have a good party at a nightclub, and you do, 
talk to the Zippies because they certainly know how to throw a good party 
in that space.  Also, get off this celestian prophacy tip as soon as 
possible because all it is doing is alienating people rather then making 
them feel more comfortable.  I know the people who organized this party (I 
love you Clair but Saturday night was a complete fuck-up) and they do, I 
am afraid to say, confirm all my fears as to what happens when you have 
young middle-class white kids trying run a club: it does not work.
Please make your next party free because I am sure that all the people 
who paid $10 wished that they stayed at home.  Next time they will so 
heed my warning.  And Clair (or anybody else for that matter) go and talk 
to Frazer from the Zippies: he REALLY knows how to throw a good party and 
he could teach you a lot.
Also, stop playing mundane techno, we've all had enough of that music 
because it was shit when it came out and it has not got better threw time.   

Better luck next time.  Love Tristan

How about by participating in environmentally beneficial activities 
like: restoring streams, wetlands and other habitat; clearing out 
invasive plants and replacing them with natives; cleaning up 
beaches; monitoring creeks and rivers; planting trees in wildlife 
preserves; etc. etc.???  All these opportunities and more are available to 
urban kids through school curricula, neighborhood outreach programs, 
and a wide variety of interest groups. 

My group and others sponsor specific hands-on programs 
that get urban schoolchildren out into the natural environment where they 
can see direct improvement in the world as a result of their work and 
where they take ownership and personal responsibility for their environment, 
i.e., their own neighborhood. By extension, they become stewards of our 
earth. These urban kids describe wildlife as "rat" and "cockroach." They 
think the Bay they see out at the Berkeley Marina is the ocean. These 
urban kids are not the ones who have $25 plus travel and expenses to go 
to Burning Man, unless there's some scholarship program I'm not aware of.
So if you're arguing that Burning Man is going to raise urban kids' 
environmental consciousness, I don't think the argument makes sense. 

I agree with Phred. The desert, every square mile of it, deserves our 
respect. The world no longer has the luxury of considering any wilderness 
area expendable, as you seem to suggest, Frasier. The desert is an 
incredibly fragile ecosystem. What looks like a 
barren stretch of sand can host a diverse array of plant and animal life. 
Walking, driving and indeed dancing on it can threaten the soil structure 
and lead to ongoing and irreversible erosion. Raving is not necessarily an 
environmentally benign activity, particularly at outdoor events where 
some people leave trash, use the world as their own personal ashtray, stomp 
around on sensitive wetlands and marshes and yes, squash the grass. And 
if the press calls us on it, they're not necessarily hostile idiots. If 
the impression we leave is that of careless disrespect for our Mother 
Earth, what else can we expect?

Kathryn

sorry, fraser, while i've agreed with most of what you've said up to this 
point, i've got strongly disagree here...

the idea of 800 ravers keeping someone awake all night and getting away 
with it because "they're the majority" is ridiculous.  this is just mob 
action, even violence if you will (if someone needs to sleep because they 
are sick or get sick as a result of their lack of sleep.)  you may say, 
well, join the rave!, but not everyone can just up and take off of work 
all the time, or, as larry suggested, some people need sleep for 
different reasons.   (however, i will concede that people who build 
estates on common land really shouldn't have a say in the matter.)

granted, there are not enough places for us to celebrate, but i still 
think we must minimize our (physical) impact as much as possible, for our 
own sake (to avoid getting busted), AS WELL AS for the sake of people 
around us.  some people just don't like techno all the time and that does 
not mean they're "unenlightened."  

and while it may be true that "nobody consciously *sets out* to keep 
other people awake," not taking care to ensure that you don't is 
negligent and irresponsible.  it's like, oh, i didn't MEAN to shoot you, 
sorry!  (to use an extreme example)

and i am most definitely NOT suggesting we stay inside and watch TV!  
there ARE ways of minimizing our impact regarding sound:

- set up the speakers so the sound does not travel far outside the 
building, or if outside, face them towards somewhere unpopulated.  do 
sound checks.

- invest in some sound blankets - they're cheap!

- the sound does not always have to be turned up to the maximum volume.  
this DOES cause hearing damage.  (what?)   (imho, the sound should be 
loud enough on the dance floor that people cannot easily carry on a 
conversation, but soft enough so that away from the dance floor they can.)

- IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, let neighbors know you'll be having a party.  


granted, sometimes we may step on people's toes (like, i'll assume every 
time we have a party outside where homeless people live we wake them up), 
but again, this should be avoided at all costs.  


with love and @,
monicat

 I'll be praying for love , and dancing for love ...

 I heard from some folks who were going to Hawkwind tonight at Slim's -
I'll be wearing my sun/moon t-shirt and a little clay talisman around my
neck - come up and say hi! If I have enough energy after that, I'll try
to drag myself over to Il Pirata at 2007 16th St. ( between Potrero Ave.
and Utah St. ) for the jungle music they have every Tuesday.

 Of course , with my cold , I may end up sleeping in my truck ...

The Burning man, woman and child (dog) event I regard as an opportunity to 
throw yourself into a hostile- to- life environment and try to experience 
catharsis. The desert can be very unfriendly and I think when Phred sez more 
respect, he means "don't take it lightly"!As It sez on the brochure "people 
have died".The rave is a side show to a neo-primitive Road Warrior meets 
Rocky Horror survivalist vaudville. 

>>to Frazer from the Zippies: he REALLY knows how to throw a good 
>>party and he could teach you a lot.

He knows how to enlist people into his projects and from what I've been told 
he can teach you how to sue them  after the party goes under. AND I would 
appreciate a public response to this accusation because I have heard it from 
many reliable sources .

got to disagree here...people throw parties for different reasons.  some 
of us throw mega-parties where (almost) anything goes, anyone 
comes...others of us throw parties for ourselves and our friends and 
maybe anyone who is interested, and this may include parties with 
specific philosophical, spiritual and political ideas highlighted.  there 
is nothing wrong with that; if you don't like it, don't come.  this does 
not mean the party is "exclusive."  focused perhaps, but not 
exclusive.  of 
course, i would hope that on their flyers they might have 
mentioned taht the party was about the celestine prophecy, etc. (i didn't 
see any flyers so i don't know)... that way, people know what they're 
getting into.

again, there is room for just about everyone in the rave 
scene/movement/whatever.  while you may not like the celestine prophecy 
stuff, others may.  are you saying that there's only one way to throw a 
party - the zippy way?  it sure sounds like it.  

(and may i remind you that your zippy parties are full of ideology which 
some people may not agree with, but whatever!  it's your right to throw a 
party the way you want to.)

  they do, I 
> am afraid to say, confirm all my fears as to what happens when you have

please, tristan, get over your guilt-tripping and race-baiting and 
assumptions about 
people based on their backgrounds.  it's not where you come from, it's 
what you believe and how you act in the world.  

granted, there may be aspects of some raves that are very 
"middle-class" - e.g. the price, the location, maybe the attitude - 
and are exclusive.  but that does not mean that things can't be 
changed and that "middle class white kids" can't run a club.  (and may i 
remind you that megatripolis was quite exclusive price-wise.)

> heed my warning.  And Clair (or anybody else for that matter) go and talk

my dear, frazer is NOT god.  megatripolis had its ups and its downs, as 
do most parties.

umm... shouldn't you have learned by now not to go to parties with techno 
if you hate it that much?  


better luck on your next post,

Okay guys, listen--if the desert involved in Burning Man is as desolate as 
Brian describes, and I'm sure it is, there's no need to lose sleep over 
environmental impact.  Goodness, when we drive to raves around here nobody
frets about CO2 emissions, or I haven't heard of anyone rearranging blades
of grass after a sunset rave, or anything like that.  And stomping on dirt
DOES NOT cause erosion when it's not on an incline... and erosion, on a cosmic
perspective, is no big deal anyway.  It changes things, but it just reallocates
soil, that's all.  One area loses dirt, another area gains dirt.  The soil
doesn't evaporate, guys.  There's no net loss, you know.  This planet is going
to be around for quite a while, and while we should be environmentally responsible, we should also remember that the universe will still glide along without
bothering to stop and read the scientific journals.
Peace and lollipops,
Timothy

i understand, i think, the point you're trying to make, but victimised?  
victims?  is this really the word you think it is?  i'm asking sincerely, 
are we victims, or can we take responsibility for ourselves by not granting 
ourselves the title of victim?  the connotations are not fitting.

They did mention it on their flyers and you had to listen to a couple min.
speal about the Celestine Prophecy Critcal Mass insight befor you could get the 
location.  However, I never felt like I was being beat over the head with any
of it (except during the location message).  I enjoyed myself, tho I would have

Besides which, thermodynamically, raves are very non-universe-friendly! 
By expending so much energy irreversibly, we only increase the entropy of 
the universe, thus moving it ever closer to its eventual perfectly random 
death. Maybe we should all just sit in our rooms and hold our breath:-)

p.s. why are there no bike racks outside of parties?

Hello,

I am writing this on behalf of the Mother Earth Sound System, to offer an 
explanation of what happened Saturday night, and our most sincere 
apologies for all of you who were inconvenienced in any way.

After losing our space on Friday, we tried to find another permitted all 
ages location without success, and Saturday night were informed of a space 
in SF that had been used several times before for break-in parties.  
Around midnight, without actually having entered the building, myself, Brad, 
Eric and Danielle were picked up by the SFPD and charged with attempted 
burglary, possession of burglary tools, and conspiracy (a felony 
charge).  Our combined bail was set at $41,000, and we thank those of you 
who were prepared to help us with it, but fortunately, on Sunday evening 
our charges were dropped (except one citation) and we were released.

Once again, Mother Eath Sound System would like to offer its deepest 
apologies for any inconvenience caused by Saturday's events.  Due to the 
volume of calls between 12-6 am, we could not even change our voicemail 
message, an unforeseen problem that we are looking into.  A number of 
things led us to attempt to do KIVA despite the risky circumstances 
we faced, and basically our desire to have an all ages gathering that 
night blurred our judgement, and we are fortunate that we escaped as we 
did, and that no partygoers were involved in what could have been a much 
worse situation.  

Much as we may disagree with and dislike the legal restrictions imposed 
on the simple human right of gathering and dancing, 
going up against the Man in such a direct way doesn't seem to be the 
answer, even though it can make a pretty powerful symbolic statement.  
Can we make the same sort of statement at a legal party?  People like 
Spiral Tribe or DIY, throwing free outdoor parties in England in defiance 
of the Criminal Justice Bill, might say no, the power of creating a truly 
autonomous zone for ourselves is worth the risk of jail, but then again, 
the relationship of the rave community and the rest of society is 
becoming an increasingly political one over there.  Over here, until 
things (may they never) get that confrontational, it looks like we'll 
try to work with the System just enough to make the party go off, which 
is what we'll be doing in a few weeks, hopefully.  We've located a legal 
indoor space which we'd like to use to do a make-up party for KIVA, and 
we'll keep you all posted on that as it develops.  In the mean time, 
we're doing a party at Le Chateau in Berkeley this Saturday 29th,  
benefitting Latin American refugees, more details as we sort it out, and 
if you're interested our info #s are: 415.487.7681 and 510.549.6260.


Much respect,

 Well , I'm physically ill with a cold , but I've been depressed as well
with the bombing in Oklahoma. And now California's own UNAbomber has 
decided to express his wood compulsion again by mailing a bomb to a 
Sacramento forestry industry representative group. Average American
citizens got to learn about the paramilitary groups we grow like weeds
in our country , full of beefy white guys and gals who , every one , feels 
that the US/Zionist Government is victimizing them personally. I and other
folks who follow alternative culture have known about these paras for a
long time. Maybe it's some minority bitterness on my part , but when the
rhetoric of these folks was directed against non-whites and the government,
they were dismissed as "mere" nutcases, but when a slew of white folks
( along with blacks and others ) get killed , all of a sudden they're a 
priority ....

 That's why I've been depressed recently - maybe that has something to do 
with me getting ill too. 

 Well - I talked alot about me!! How are you , SoundGod? Hope you're 
feeling better ....

Just one of the "nice" things Tristan had to say was:

(I love you Clair but Saturday night was a complete fuck-up)

Ah...love!  Funny thing isn't it?  So many faces, so many levels...

What is this, the New Love Tristan?  The kind of love conveniently void of
any respect, or decency.  Or did this just spewing forth from your head
because it sounded good?

Maybe this one statement, albeit paranthetical (which might make it even
worse -- like saying, "Come a little close."), shows just how base you are.
I don't want to speak for Clair, for I don't know her, but dude, where the
fuck are your manners?  Take the "I love you, but..." flames off-line.

It's one thing to be an antagonist, it's another to be a complete asshole.

I'll take my answer off-line, thank you.  Oh and by the way, I really love
the show.  Case in point.  Please keep stroking Frazer's eggo, it makes me
laugh every time:

And Clair (or anybody else for that matter) go and talk
to Frazer from the Zippies: he REALLY knows how to throw a good party and
he could teach you a lot.

If he's affected you in any way, no matter how slight, all I have to say is:

"Class dismissed!"

Tony

This is a known hoax.  There is no such virus.  Virus's
don't spread by email, you actually have to run an infected

THE "Good Times" VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND

In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information requests
about a supposed "virus" which could be contracted via America OnLine, simply
by reading a message.  The following is the message that CIAC received: 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.    |
|                                                                           |
|  Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on   |
| America Online being sent by E-Mail.  If you get anything called "Good    |
| Times", DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your |
| hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university
at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax. 

CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any
electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" will infect your
computer. 

This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to the
fact that many people have seen a message with "Good Times" in the header. 
They delete the message without reading it, thus believing that they have
saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports give a false
sense of credibility to the alert message. 

There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with
"xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic, because
he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he
checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his machine.
 He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the
virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail
message).  This person then spread his alert. 

As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely through
reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program must be executed.
Reading a mail message does not execute the mail message.  Yes, Trojans have
been found as executable attachments to mail messages, the most notorious
being the IBM VM Christmas Card Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm
(reference CIAC Bulletin B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).
 But this is not the case for this particular "virus" alert. 

If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists, simply
ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a false rumor.

re the post by/From: "Andrew B. Lawson" <lawson@nature.Berkeley.EDU>


UUhhh dude, NOT!



this belongs in alt.urbine.ledgends.silly

Think about this for a bit, e-mail is just a string of text.

in order for test to do anything (in an ms dos enviorment) it has to 
be run as a batch file. i dont know about you, but i use a windows 
e-mail program, I dont run my e-mail from the command line, and even 
if i did, i would use the TYPE command.

But that asside, common sence should tell youthat reading a text file 
wont make you go blind,format your hard disk, or vote republician.

its just text, and all text does is make words on your screen, eaven 
if i was to e-mail you a batch file, you would stil have to run it, 
in order for it to format your drive.

bonous ponts for caring enough to let people know that there is a 
problem,how ever, THINK!

all the info in the world, wont make up for being stupid.
If this was a real virus report, it would tell something like  what 
machines does it run on, what the symptons are and what the fix is.

It would also contain a few e-mail adresses/ftp sites for more 
information.

remember only YOU can decide to be a well meaning silly person.
or you can check out the story befor passing it on...


rev..


Btw i saw elvis and Marylin, they were having fun with this realy old 
tape deck, crumpling up old recordings of the 'kings' tunes, and 
overdubbing  some realy funky eurotrash techno ontop...

They were doing this in that 'make a song/sing along' boot at great 
amrikkkia, no honest,realy...

and you didnt have to file your taxes eather....

Tony could you please refrain from including those like Fraser, who have
had  nothing to do with the "slagging"  done by Tristan, in your replies.
It would be good of you to display at least  some respect for the idea of
individualism. Just because some of us are not american-born, does not mean
that we are not individuals. And for that matter, this goes for anyone else
who would like to diss without forethought.

        Well I hate to contradict someone when they're 99% (maybe)
right, but a false sense of security can be dangerous (where have we
heard this before).

        One of the earliest "viruses" around exploited a "feature" of
some DEC terminals (this is in the pre-PC days).  They allowed some
function keys to be programmed via escape codes over the serial line.
They also allowed the function keys to be activated via escape codes,
if I recall correctly.  The result was that it was possible to send a "mail
bomb" which would result in the terminal sending commands back to the
system -- masquerading as the recipient.  "DELETE *.*" quite possibly.

        Now call it coincidence but AOL also has a front-end which runs
on the customer's PC and can be activated by escape codes.  I've only
spent a few hours in AOL chat and I've seen it exploited (for amusement 
only fortunately).

        The recent email that has been floating around re "good times"
is obviously off the deep end -- not restricted to AOL anymore and including
a bunch of gobbledygook intended to create FUD (fear uncertainty doubt).
However, like many urban legends, it may be rooted in reality.  And as
MIME and other "active" mail formats become more popular, there will be
more opportunities for unpleasant/immature people to find ways to make
"mail bombs".  As they say, the only perfect security is a good backup.

Haven't you guys figured out yet that all Tristan is doing is trolling? 
Potentially,  or just outright inflammatory remarks regarding race and 
socio-economic status, trying to get people pissed off enough to bitch so 
he can satisfy some unknown desire? Hell I thought F&F was the "worst" 
party he had been to. Now it is Progress. Well on the positive side, at 
least F&F got better in his eyes..... :-)

ARGHH!!! I hate these hoaxes. There is NO virus that will damage a 
processor. The only machine that had an actual command that you could 
enter to damage it was the PET by Commodore in the early 80's. There are no 
viruses that are started because you simply read a message(except MAYBE, 
under very specific circumstances ANSI BOMB's which are not the same thing.)
A similar "warning" with the same subject (supposed "Good Times" virus) 
was posted here a few months back, only now the story has been 
embellished slightly with the FCC issuing the warning. Look at the AC for 
the supposed author. Alabama is AC 205. Relax, this warning is B.S.

good work, kathryn .. but about what percentage of urban kids do
you think these sorts of programs actually convert?  RC has the
possibility to convert a whole generation, to make it *fashionable* (dare
I say it?!) to *care*. it's all been seen in the Uk for the last few years
- older rainbow types moaning about "all these urban types who won't clean
up after themselves"  and eg break dwon trees to make fires that won't
even light 'cos the wood's green.  BUT, after a while, they *get* it. 
just like each of us did, presumably.  and then they turn on others and so
it goes - now it's *ver* very "fashionable for lioterally thousands of
raver kids to go out and try to stop motorway building and all the rest of
it. truly, they do get radicalised by being out there - and they're not
going to go in large numbers for "replanting ceremonies".  that's just a
fact.  to make a fuss about the damage while thery're learning is to miss
the point that it's *corporate vandalism* that's 99% of the problem.  and
the only real way to stop *that* is for a "peoples movement" demanding it. 
and how do you create that if most urban kids, as you point out, think the
Bay is the Ocean.  you gotta get 'em out there to *experience* it.  we're
on the same side.  we're arguing about tactics.  and if, as you seem, you
know how fragile the balance is and how late the hour is, then you have to
realise that the methods you describe just won't do it. IMHO
and think much bigger and much more determinedly

Well, I didn't think I would be back so soon - what 2 whole days?!?!?  I 
wanted to say a hearty *thank you* to all who responded to my post on 
Sunday evening.  If I didn't respond to you personally, I am doing it 
now.  I was nearly overwhelmed at all the love and support I recieved 
from so many.  It gave me such hope and faith in this whole thing called 
a rave community.  You all showed me it exists *fully* and I am 
***PROUD*** to be a part of it!! :)  My heart is now 
stronger than ever, although I'm still quite sad at what happened - time 
heals that.  And so do great people and great music - which is why if 
Sunset is happening this weekend I am going to be there *for sure*!!
I've just got to meet you all - especially those who gave me such warm 
words these last few days (and you know who you are:) Thank you again.

live with PLUR 
and it will come 
back to you......
luv,
Amy

hey all,

  in my photojournalism class today i was showing some of the pictures
i had been taking for my photo essay about  raves and stuff and my
teacher asks me "what are raves?"

  before i can respons one lady says "everyone is on drugs there."
and then another person is like "yeah they all do ecstacy there."
  and yet another person is like "when i went to one all thes people
were touching me."

  i tried to break in and give a explanation about raves "you know
they are big dance parties where people can come together no matter 
who they are and just dance and have fun without attitudes and fights
and all that."


  which someone replys "yeah, cause everyone is on x (ecstacy)


  needless to say the encounter as a whole pissed me off and leads me
to ask:  "What can i say or what can i do to make raves sound like
something to check out?"

  i mean  the stuff about everyone together dancing and having a good 
time must sound to someone who hasent been to one like some stupid
joke or something, but its true.

  ive been in the scene for awhile and have gone through my cynical
cycle on how raves are a joke, but i keep coming back cause i like
the openess, the ability to walk up to someone and say "hi" and 
to dance my ass off smiling and having a good time.


  why is that so hard for a lot of people to understand??

fine, monicat, there would be something wrong if we agreed *all* the 
time.  >:-)

I take *all* your points, but I just think we're being far too 
apologetic.  if we were living in a close-to-paradise culture and a whole 
bunch of rude kids showed up ... well, sure, *BUT WE'RE NOT*. hell, it's 
even illegal to walk around *naked*, for Goddess' sake!!!  see my point?  
this culture is so repressed that even the naked body upsets people.

how about the following for a general policy:  turn people ON, don't turn 
them OFF.  but don't let's turn *ourselves* OFF either because that won't 
ultimately help *anyone*.

I was suggesting a democratic vote, not mob action.  rephrase what you 
said and you get this:  the idea of someone making 800 others stay home 
and keep quiet because they're the minority is ridiculous. and a lot worse.

totally agree.  at the ChemicaSutras (last friday's one was amazing) we've
been keeping the volume probably half what you'd normally expect and it
works (actually) even better!

interestingly tangential point, monicat.  wonder if larry gives them the
same weight he gives the wage slave.  oh and BTW when I say wage slave I'm
not being hostile to that person.  I *care* very deeply that hir whole
life is being shafted by the current system.  *nobody* should be forced by
a lifetime of hypnotic propaganda and financial controls to be a wage
slave.  we and the planet need a lot *less* "busyness", a *lot* less. and
a lot less consumption. nor am I telling anyone how they should live
(before the flames start).  I'm not holding a gun or a new law to stop you
doing anything.  but I *am* sugesting very stronlgly indeed (and shall
continue to do it - it's the planet that makes me do it!!) that maybe
others have been doing that to you and you should start deconditioning
yourself.  look at it beyond the kneejerk reaction of "aw, but then I
couldn't buy that neat new whatever I thought meant life and death to me!"

let the flaming begin.

well, that's certainly *not* what I'm saying!  by "hostile to life" I

A few copies of my DJ tape LILA (Sanskrit for the Divine Dance) are now 
available at Ameba. They may be a bit hard to spot so ask Allen if you 
don't see it at first glance.

One side is trance , the other ambient with traks from artists like:

System 7
Paragliders
Zen Paradox
Eat Static
Suns of Arqa 
Heavenly Music Corp etc.
and a short spoken word excerpt from Gene Rodenberry the creator of Star Trek

in fact I was comparing larry's description of the HWBS being victimised 
with *us* being victimised.  I agree with you, up to a point, sig.  
*they* (?) are trying to victimise us.  but we shouldn't get into that head 
space (while not fooling ourselves with what we think spirituality is 
telling us that it's not happening and ,even if it is, it's all illusion 
or karma or something.)  I'll settle for evolutionary love guerillas.

I was once at an all-night rave in Somerset and, when we'd finally danced 
the sun up, pagan style, we realised that the entire fenced-off dance area, 
 was surrounded by literally hundreds of curious looking cows, all 
gazing at us.  they didn't look "victimised" to me.  
rock'nroll music kills plants.  but plants thrive under house music, and 
it's well established (in the UK anyway) that house music helps a baby 
fall asleep. (not asleep yet?  turn up the volume!)   certainly I can sleep 
thru house music - if the spirit moves me, or, rather, doesn't.

amy, 
certainly there were things happening that you missed.  me too.  one of 
our main aims in throwing a party is definitely to leave everyone with 
the feeling that they missed plenty.  I love that feeling personally.  we 
even used to put up confusing signs in Meatripolis/London to make sure 
people were even more lost than before (in the nicest possible way, of 
course!)  lost as in an eastern bazaar.
as for going on the roae and keeping it intimate.  not entirely sure on 
this one yet.  I think we cold esily go up to 300 people andkeep the 
intimacy.  above that I'm not sure.
and here we segue into your next question.  the people who were there 
were drawn from all walks of life as I'm sure you noticed.  the way 
through to your last question is probably to build this "family" of 
people (maybe let 'em in free next time) so that the "intimacy"  alreaddy 
outnumbers the alienation.  see what I mean?
the lovely green liquid has been used among certain african tribes for 
their fortnight-long sexual initiations.  as for the "scientific" reason, 
ask Dan, or get the book andfind out about some of the other totally 
legal Romance Drugs (as I prefer to call them):
[ Better Sex Through Chemistry - A Guide to the New Prosexual Drugs.  It's 
available from us for $14.95 (plus $3 postage)  cheques to Megatripolis - 
BOX 12, 3288 21st St, SF, CA 94110) ]
I'm involved because the author asked us to organise a book rave launch, 
having attended our book rave for Leary's new book last november.
the museum was put together by John Wickett, the handsome sparkly-eyed 
old guy who was bustling about.
don't mind you asking questions at all!
don't miss the Cyberlab 7 Safari on May 12th.  get the digital camera 
booked now!

Don't you DARE lecture me, Fraser Clark, about environmental issues, or
about the Gulf War for that matter.  I've been an energy consultant for
well over 15 years.  I marched in *three* cities -- San Francisco, Seattle
and Portland -- against the war.  I know all about oil and vinyl, my friend.

So it's "only one square mile" of the desert being used by Burning Man.
Well, you could have mentioned that two-thirds of the desert West is
basically used primarily by the US military -- ask any of the ranchers
about fighter jet overflights.  And of course Nevada is the home of
the underground nuclear test sites and numerous other environmental
insults.

Which is the *very* reason I object to what I perceive as the basic
approach to Burning Man, which is to practice pseudo-mystical self-
indulgence in the extreme environment of the desert.  Quite frankly,
though I have considerable trouble with the social climate of the
Rainbow tribal scene, I have much more respect for their approach to
the land.  

In the most pure and extreme of environmental zones, whether it's the
high desert, rainforests, arctic tundra or seashores, we must tread the
most lightly.  The marks of Rommel's tanks can still be found in the
North African deserts, and the same for maneuvers practiced by the US
Army in the south of California *before* World War I.  I wonder what
residues Burning Man leaves behind?  

I do not insist that everyone follow my way of thinking on this.  I'm
only saying this is what my heart tells me about the Burning Man event.
Others' mileage may well vary.

This should be called Email Burning....
Everyone is entilteled to thier own Ideals, as we all are entitled to our own
dance styles...
I rarely post, whoever, it's rare to notice such animosity in the rave
community.....
Remember, peace and love is what brought is all here (not to  mention $$$$on
computers, modems and Net accounts).  
Let's try to keep the arguments "hate" out of the debate.

Several people have asked me to elaborate on my responses about Burning Man.
As I said, this is purely a personal view.  I've read some of the newsletters,
some of the reportage, and talked with quite a few participants.  I get
the sense it's well organized, has a serious purpose as well as a sort of
let-it-all-hang-out-attitude, and most people who've gone really had a 
good time.

All the same, I guess it's the environmental purist in me rebelling against
some of the reported aspects of the event.  And you know, I really can't
put my finger exactly on what it is that bothers me.  I know that will
upset those who like the event, but please understand me -- it's not that
I want to take away from anyone's enjoyment, it's that my heart stronglyu
tells me this is NOT the event for me.  

We all make choices about what things to do in this life.  I'm sure there
are people we know would *love* to go to our rave-type events, and just
can't bring themselves to do so.  As in my case with Burning Man, they
may not have *valid* or *well-informed* reasons for this from our point

lightly.  

So rather than turn this into an extended riff, I'll just leave it at that.

The so-called "alert" about the "Good Times Virus" has *itself* become
a nuisance meta-virus of a sort.  It keeps circulating on email systems
around the world (this is, what, the second year of this?!) and seemingly
cannot be eradicated.  It even showed up in a corporate email system
where I'm the sysadmin.  Sigh . . .

I'll DARE to lecture you, Fred Heutte, since you've DARED to lecture me on
Rave Culture (since the first week the Zippies appeared on the net) about
which I knew more than you know today on the day you first discovered it.
I didn't complain, I took it on the chin - and still do.  I marched (and

a Rave Against the Grave (of Desert Storm) at the Fridge in Brixton the
night your president ordered your possibly future president to launch the

[ to SFRaves mailist ]

 I'm afraid that raves have spoiled me , as I now find the average annoyances
of rock concerts much more annoying.

 Tonight , I actually lost my temper at someone - the first time for me at
a rock concert or rave . Near the last half of the concert I went to tonight,
a gal came up behind me ( I was at the edge of the stage ) , and started
in with derogatory words and gestures aimed at the singer. This was somewhat
alarming , but she would also YELL at the singer while her mouth was
4 inches from my left ear. Also lunging towards the stage whenever the singer
got close to our side of the stage ( which was often ).

 Unfortunetly for me, the pitch of her scream was just at the frequencies
where my hearing HURTS, so , finally , I lost it and shoved her in front
of me in order to avoid her YELLING in my ear one more time. Needless to
say , her friends were alarmed , and things were tense for awhile. Things
got back to semi-civilized level ( for the middle of a rock concert ) - 
I later learned that she was a tour guest of the band , and a friend of the 
singer. All the shit she was yelling at him was meant in fun ( sheesh ...).

 People don't yell in my ear at raves , although it's happened most times
I can remember when I'm in the pit at a rock concert. The closest thing was
that dreadful whistle blowing fad - glad that's gone. I had the same problem
with whistle frequencies being in a bad, hurtful frequency range for me. 
When people yell at raves , it's with their heads tilted upwards in communal
howl.

 Such nic(er) people at raves ...

 I checked out ( for a short time ) the Jungle music at Il Pirata on
16th . Nice folks , and a lot more black folks that at most recent
raves I've been to ( I think I was the only asian there for the hour
and 20 minutes I was there ). The door guy was friendly , and warned me
about moving my vehicle before the meter maid tagged it ( street cleaning ).

 The dance area had an aggresively placed strobe light that blasted your 
eyes if you didn't look away ( hard to do , since it was placed at one corner
close to the speakers ). The speaker cabinets had a hard time with some
of the dub-style low frequencies , "doubling" with a horrible baritone
squawk every time it tried to do them low notes. The speaker cabinets
had pink(?) fake fur on them - I've seen them before , but I don't
know where ...

 Music was great! Jungle is such fun to dance to , once you give up the idea
of twiching to every damn sound in the mix ( or even more fun if you try
to! ). I recommend trying it out some Tuesday night ( just be sure to park
your car carefully ...).

I'm sorry, but millions of people vote that you are entitled to a good
night's sleep.

Your example is functionally equivalent to walking down a street alone at
night and encountering a gang.
They "vote" to beat you up.  You're saying that's okay, because they are a
majority????

Don't you get the sfr calendar?  Looks like lots of dance parties going on,
and
all sorts of clubs, some all night.
I've read on this list about all sorts of events out in the country (eg river
clean-up).

If you don't like the music and attitude of these events, rent a space and
get permits. 
I'm surprised that the promoters haven't gotten together to do this.
They should contact Bill Graham Presents.
(Bill Graham used to provide spaces for Dead concerts, where RC has been
ongoing without interruption for 30 years.  If he were alive today, he'd be
very
interested in providing spaces for techno/house RC events.)
The city officials respect BGP, because of their $$$.

the HWBS is *not* being victimised in this sense ie nobody consciously 
*sets out* to keep others awake.  it's just that there's so little space

Been reading all this stuff on Burning man,  and as last years attendee,
for those who haven't been there,  it's a real enlightening experience.

I can say for those plannng to go this year,   is that the environment is
hostile... And if you don't plan or observe certain things,  you die!!  It's
simple as that.    It's really easy to just wonder off away from camp,   and
get over 3 1/2 miles out...  The camp literally dissapears below the horizon.

If you don't pay attention to things like direction of travel,  or take your
bearinge before you strike out (Should you ever want to),   you could easily
lose your bearings and wonder in the wrong direction.   Especially at night!!

USE the STARS as reference,  learn how to use them to navagate...   Out there,
it;s just like navagation on the ocean.   It's FLAT FEATURELESS dirt.

Bring plenty of water...  It's HOT in daytime,  freezing cold at night...
COME PREPARED!!   But some with NO EXPECTATIONS!!   You will really dig it
to the max...

If you set up camp,   establish some sort of unique "Beacon light" for your 
camp.   Or before you leave your camp,  take a bearing on where you are in
relation to the "Man".

There are really great hot springs nearby,  bring plenty of sunscreen,  chapstick
and anything else to deal with very dry conditions.

Usually,  the rave will be about a mile or so away from the main camp.  People
usually drive aimlessly out there,  and often don't look for people when away from
the camp.   It's possible to aim the car in any arbitrary direction and drive
for hours without hitting anything.

I remember when I first got there,   from the road,   I could only see this tiny
blue dot...   But from down on the flats,  it was not visible.   As I approached
it became visible...   Always giving me the impression that it was a few hundred
feet away,   But after 15 minutes of driving,  it became evident just how far
away it REALLY was.    Distances are extremly deceptive out in the desert.

On the lighter side,  tommorrow I fly to Adelaide to go to yet another rave
in yet another Australian city.   Be looking for a great report in a few days.

Later....

i understand, i think, the point you're trying to make, but victimised?  
victims?  is this really the word you think it is?  i'm asking sincerely, 
are we victims, or can we take responsibility for ourselves by not granting 
ourselves the title of victim?  the connotations are not fitting.  

curious,
sig


ps  in the words of beck, "everyone's out to get you, muther-fucker..." ;)
-------------------------------------------
I agree with sig in the sense that we as a society overuse the term 
"victim" to the point of meaninglessness. However, there are victims.

Someone who's pushed off a cliff on the evil whim of another is a victim. 
Someone who ignores warning signs and slides off a cliff cannot claim to 
be a victim because there were no guard rails installed.

When the police bust a permitted party operating within legal noise 
limits because one person calls up and complains, the police victimize 
the party organizers and participants. The police changed the rules to 
accommodate their whims.

Party organizers arrested for breaking into a warehouse are not victims. 
Everyone knows it's illegal. Expect to be caught.

You might consider them activists practicing civil disobedience, however. 
Pleading civil disobedience in court seldom causes charges to be dropped 
(though lately it seems the charges aren't even pursued). The act itself, if 
done forthrightly and frequently, can and does motivate government to 
change its laws. 

Of course there are lots of gray areas - local governments rarely provide 
coherent, much less feasible, procedures for obtaining permits or 
complying with ordinances - but I think similar principles can always be 
applied.

...still thinking about it,
nate

no, (I'm white and) that immediately occurred to me, too. A whole Florida 
town of mainly black residents got slaughtered not too long ago (the late 
fifties, was it?) and only recently does it creep into the national press. 

It was interesting to see George Will bristle every time someone used the 
term "right-wing extremists." Seems like lawmakers are stumbling over 
themselves to declare the need to "crack down" and "sacrifice 
personal freedoms."  Kinda depresses me, too. I try to remember that it's a 
cycle, not a sink.

Even so, on Sunday, hippie hill in GG Park and Bryce & Co.'s  
micro-renegade vastly improved my outlook :-> The sun is constant and 
warm!
 
take care all!

I find your experience "interesting" but what is says to me is :

 1) most of our society has NO COMMUNITY (or at least a common shared one)
 
 and as an outgrowth of 1) most of us

 2) don't REALLY listen or HEAR each other

These people were NOT responding to what you were trying to say because
they weren't hearing you - instead they were listening to their "media
feed voices buzzing inside their heads"... there was no attempt to connect
with you or what you were saying  --- frustrating isn't it?

  On the other hand when I tell a "close" friend about my experiences with
raves they become interested - because they value me (and my thoughts ) and
if they know me, they know that I am not a destructive person so they
re-evaluate the media lines about raves... On the other hand, I often warn
them that yes there is indeed a very high incidence of drug use but I
always go on to say : 1) most of it is within the realm of "responsible"
drug use and 2) doing drugs is NOT necessary to partake of the scene so
each person can make their own decisions about that issue... that usually
defuses the drug issue - at least for most of my straight friends who have
a brain and actually choose to use them :-)

i had a bit of hardware architecture in college; my impression was

  that the registers of all CPUs are made VERY indestructable, kind of
    like the way first and fifth gears of manual transmissions are made
     of extra-tuff steel;

basically, the accumulator and primary registers can take millions of
  times more accessing than RAM before they fail; maybe billions...

so go on, use and ABUSE that accumulator!

I don't throw parties anymore because I know how extreamly difficult it 
is to throw a good one and how very easy it is to throw a bad one; a fact 
that most people round here seem to have forgotton or never known in the 
first place.
Having said that, however, watch this space!

Frazer Clark has never ripped off any one in his entire life.  He is a 
gentleman and a scholor and has got more intgreaty then most of the other 
people on the SF rave scene put together.  He has a very positive energy 
and knows how to get people motivated for the good.  A genuine catalyst 
in every sense of the word.  Any bad press that he does get are by people 
who are merely jeolous aboiut his abilities and his vibe.  He is as 
responsible as anybody for making the UK scene the world-wide force that 
it has become and for this he deserves nothing but absoloute respect.
And anybody that slags him off (see below) are making un-edeucated statements
about matters that they know nothing about.

 Oh, ya...?                  RE>>Internet Virus (fwd)
According to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Computer Advisory Team
the "Good Time" virus is a hoax.  It was found to be a collage student prank
that got out of hand.  

I received this information from the Livermore Laboratory yesterday.  

-rick

PS.  Computer Viruses normally invade executable applications/programs.  The
virus will lay dormant until the application is executed.  At that time the
virus generally propagates or sets itself up to perform some action(s),
generally attacking your computer's hard disk.  The virus, a string of computer
code, being apart of an executing application allows the virus code to 
directly instruct the processor.  This generally does not occur with
documents/data files.

Games are a big target for viruses.  Everyone play them and no one knows what
to expect during execution.  We would not think that anything is wrong with a
three headed green monster starring out of the screen laughing, while a
background process scramble your File Allocation Tables.

Sorry for being long winded.....

ARGHH!!! I hate these hoaxes. There is NO virus that will damage a 
processor. The only machine that had an actual command that you could 
enter to damage it was the PET by Commodore in the early 80's. There are no 
viruses that are started because you simply read a message(except MAYBE, 
under very specific circumstances ANSI BOMB's which are not the same thing.)
A similar "warning" with the same subject (supposed "Good Times" virus) 
was posted here a few months back, only now the story has been 
embellished slightly with the FCC issuing the warning. Look at the AC for 
the supposed author. Alabama is AC 205. Relax, this warning is B.S.

Soon you will be confronted with the secret deeper meaning of punk/new 
wave. I certainly hope that this suing stuff is totally untrue because I have 
absolutely no problem with what you are into otherwise. In the old punk days 
we used to hate having to endure hippie music everytime we wanted to cop 
some acid. But now its the other way around isn't it?

Anyhow ,if you deny these  accusations I'll be glad to take you at your word:
Did you threaten suit against your partners Mark and Cairo after 
Megatripolis S.F. ended? Did you threaten suit against Those in England for 
continuing with the name Megatripolis? I know there is a big differrence 
between filing and threatening, and I would be shocked if it went so far as 
filing. However just threatening as  a tactic is a total betrayal of all you 
supposedly stand for and would be an example of the kind of Hippy 
Hippocrasy which punk stood strongly against.

As many of you know, I'm going through a trying period right now. I found 
a way to sort of "escape from the present" for a little while and dive 
into fond memories of the past.  Today I popped in Tony's *The Ultimate 
Seduction* from way back - was it '92? - when I very first got into 
raving.  Oh the wonderful sweet memories! :) Just hearing how the music 
was a little different gives me an escape - especially when it has been a 
long time since I heard the songs on the tape.  What kinds of things do 
you all feel when you do this?  Of course I love just about all the new 
stuff coming out too....always anxious to hear something new and deep, 
but boy, sometimes those old tapes work wonders just when you need it! 
(gonna have to break out my *Vision* collection now..)

livin' the PLUR,
Amy

hey all,

  in my photojournalism class today I was showing some of the pictures
I had been taking for my photo essay about  raves and stuff and my
teacher asks me "what are raves?"
...Doug ) ( Doug@nectar.comma
---------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry your classmates steamrolled you like that. Regardless of what the
subject is, it's not considerate or constructive.

Personally, when I'm asked "what are raves?", I try to be open and honest about
the drug aspect, and in doing so emphasize that taking drugs is not a prerequisite
to enjoyment. Still, I've more or less given up trying to dispel the
characterization of raves as "drug parties." Rather, I try to leave the
impression that they're "nice drug parties." While the word "drug" immediately
conjures up negative images of dark alleyways, guns, and derelicts, it's not so
hard to remind people that the rock (n' roll) scene they grew up with wasn't exactly
clean and sober, nor was it the exclusive domain of pushers and addicts.

I by no means try to portray it as something _everyone_ should check out. Anyone
who shows interest (or even just intense curiosity), though, I offer to take
them along to a rave. I've taken people who loved it and wanted to go to every
event thereafter. I've also taken people who thought it was really interesting,
were honestly glad they came, but still prefer to spend their evenings (and
mornings :-) in other ways. So far, I've been successful in judging who not to
take (i.e., if you really hate to dance, you'll probably get bored).

Though others might strongly disagree, I don't think there's anything wrong with
bringing "tourists" to raves (as long as they're not the "ugly American" type,
of course :-). Not only is it good PR for our community, but I think it
genuinely enhances the tourist hirself in terms of experiencing the diversity of
human expression. Raves, you know, aren't the only way to celebrate life -
people have been doing it for thousands of years in as many different forms.

take care!

Hello everyone,
	I was just at the record store here in S.J. and picked up a 
smarties flyer. I heard from someone in the store that it was going to 
be near Sac. But, what I really want to now is who is putting it on? Is 
it the same people from Smarties ALONG TIME AGO or is it someone new? 
Either way I will most likely be going. I just have a courious mind!!! 
If anyone knows, respond!! Thanx :)

Peace, love and harmony to all,

(major IMHO)

  regarding the clobbering of life in the desert; if there was only
    a way to get ALL of mankind's destructive acts to occur out in
      the desert (INSTEAD of forests, reefs, wetlants, etc) we'd all
        be better off.

  let's not forget that the major chains of life and the highest densities
    of critters per square inch occur in rainforests, reef flats, wetlands,
      coral reefs, etc;

  as time progresses and we wipe all the forests off the face of the
    earth, THE WHOLE PLANET will become a desert.

  at that time, there will be PLENTY of real estate for the cacti,
   mesquite, and other arid scrub to eke out a living, because we will
    all be GONE.

Hey all,

Steve's with me today and he wanted to share his experience at the Endup 
this Sunday. later...

Here's Steve
 
The closing of the End Up after 22 years of the tea dance is a recent 
indicator of the years that formed the textures of the S.F. Scene. 
Definiti, the best house conglomeration based on gravitational 
attraction. Seizmicly and poli tacticly both indeferent but more 
likly indifferent to the common persons human nature. it should also 
be our loudest hidden edge to brace our nomadic wander thru 
acceptance and the nurturing of of love pure.discussions and 
involvement at least are capable of being. dancers became unstatic 
and the gay scene was introduced to a more mixed comfort zonality.    

personaly I don't think that no one will let this international point of 
history slip away without the need to at least organizationally crystall 
eyze from common appreciation of the arts.

Nuff never said...Late

Steve...Pause Reflective.

 Just an encouragement to some other folks on SFRaves who may have the
false impression that my original posts about antisocial aspects of raves
were asked of only one or two individuals - I'm willing to hear anybody 
else's opinions/reactions to my posts too! ( That's why my original

Newt King sez:
"I enjoyed myself, tho I would have liked a bit more energy."

True it wasn't out of control massive crowd energy, but I really enjoyed the
intimate vibe -- you can tell what this energy is coming from what person.
  Energy comes from within, but I can't believe how often I still forget this
simple truth.  I'll still arrive at a party and think the energy is kinda low
and blame the crowd size(too big, too small, I don't see many people I know)
or the music(too fast, too slow) or the space(too smoky, too dark) -- you get
the idea.  Of course thats usually not the problem, its just me not putting
any energy out so only a little ambient energy comes back rather than a
full-blown two-way transfer.  After relaxing a little and dancing a while in
the middle of the crowd I lighten up and start sending out positive energy
and good vibes because I'm happy and suddenly there's SO much more energy.  I
just need to find a way to get around that initial transition phase.

Try concentrating on how *you* feel - or how you want to feel.  If you 
*want* to feel good vibes, send them out enthusiastically.  There have 
been times at a party where the vibes are okay, if not nil, and one or 
more people come join the crowd with such energy and enthusiasm, the rest 
of the place catches on immediately.  Many people just need an extra 
"boost" to gettem going.  Enthusiasm and good vibes are *CONTAGIOUS*!!

love to all,
Amy

Word has it that Smarties will be held in the warehouse that the old Grind 
Skatepark used to be in. It's near the air force base. It is put on by 
Ultra 5 productions, which is basically Frank Gomez, who owns the InThaMix 
record store and promoted Ooga Booga and many other Sacramento events. 
Along with him I believe are Carlos Campos and maybe other Sac-based DJs.
I don't know if this is affiliated with a previous Smarties party, but I 
do know the space was used for the last big party up here. That's all my 
intelligence sources can provide...

So youre against Burning Man, Fred.

Is there anything that you are for, thats rave related or are you just a
spoiler trying to persuade us that big open air rave freedom is bad for us
and the environment too.

As far as I'm concerned, WE are the Environment, and as much as Humans are
Creatures too, I don't see any problem with getting in touch with nature in
an overwhelmingly positive event dedicated sacred ritual.

Do we get to dance on the Earth or don't we, its that simple.

Mud on your toes and sand in your hair will awaken more environmental
consciousness in us, than all the dancing in the dark, safe, police
controlled indoors ever will. Lets get into the nature folks, and take back
our basic freedoms. Its summer after all.

Dear All;

	An assembly language program that will "kill" a PC. From the book 
80386/80286 Assembly Language Programming, authors Murray & Pappas.

This program switches into Protected Virtual Mode, changes the display 
attribute to reverse video, and returns to Real Mode to exit to DOS. 
Modifed for collor monitor and card.

i think i may be need to clarify my point a bit, not because you didn't 
"understand" it exactly, but because i don't think i was too clear in 
the first place.  i'll be as brief as i can.

this is true to me:  we are all free, always.  in order to be vicimised 
we each have to choose freely to take the roll of victim.  this is 
really difficult to articulate, but basically i can give this one 
example of not doing the victim thing when the oppertunity to do so was 
present:  a friend of mine was arrested a while back for tresspassing.  
she wanted to play in the forest at night (like we all can't relate to 
that!), but it was against the law.  so she was brought to the police 
station and that whole ritual.  now, we all could rant about this 
injustice, about not being given the basic right to play with nature 
anytime we felt moved to do so.  but good old jess, she didn't rant, 
she smiled.  she smiled for her mug shot.  and the man (or who ever the 
hell "they" are) couldn't take that away from her and he can't take it 
from us; even if he cuts off our lips, we can always find ways to 
smile.  do we want play victim to the will of someone else or do we 
want to find a way to coexist with conflicting ideas, even when its 
sometimes uncomfortable take responsability and commit to bringing 
about this coexistance?  i choose to smile and to be responsable

there are of course times when it's extremely difficult not to give up 
responsability.  torture, and i mean extreme physical and psycological 
torture, is a prime example.  but we're not being tortured.  we as a 
movement and as individuals are free to dance, we're free to sing we're 
free to hug and to kiss and even to take illegal drugs and to 
tresspass.  we must be free to do so, at least to some extent, because 
we do it.  and anyone who doesn't want to dance and sing and so forth 
is free not to. 

again, i'm feeling rather boxed in with words at trying to explain what 
exactly i mean.  if i'm getting too unrave related (yes, sig, you    
are ;) this thread should by all means stop, but i'd like to discuss 
the subject still with anyone at all who's interested by private mail, 
etc.

and for further information on not being a victim, please consult your 
nearest nest of saws reprsentitive (you know who you are, my blessed 
sisters :) 

love from all over the universe,
sig

It won't happen (%90 sure) in the old skate park. BTW It's now a batting
cage. We did common ground there and it was OK, nothin special.
I had to sublet sound this time though to one of my customers. It's big
stuff!!!!

I'm not supposed to say where it is but think State Fair!(hehehe)

yes, but, smiling and lipless or not, she wasn't dancing in the woods no
more.  and if some poor psyhopathic wretch (driven crzy by this crazy
system) guns me down in a supermarket before I have time to smile, what
then? 

I'm slightly teasing.  I agree absolutely that we must avoid victim 
psychology.  but I don't take the next (new age?) step that I create the 
problem in the first place. lastly (because we're probably off-subject) 
if you go too far dwon the road you're pointing at, sig, you can end up 
blaming yourself and, like many a "spiritual" hippy end up doing nothing 
about the state of the world because you'e not pure enough or ready.  
we can be love warriors, we're not required (or expected) to be saints.

Hello,

I was in the desert north of Reno a weeks ago, and, this year, all of the dry
lakes have reverted to being normal wet lakes.

Perhaps the organizers ought to inspect the site before hand just to be
sure...

So what, it kills it, you turn the computer off and then back on. It 
would not damage the processor. I have seen a couple of viruses that can 
destroy a couple of types of monitors, and one that attempts to 
destroy(physically) your HD. But nothing to date that will destroy your 
processor, except the Intel Virus(OOPS I mean the Intel public relations 
people. :)

i couldn't agree with you more, both about the energy at the Progress party
and about energy in general; and this has application/relevance well beyond
the dance floor!  that little ITP (initial transition phase) rears its ugly
head in *so* many areas...

CRUSH THE ITP!!!  RADIATE POSITIVITY WITHOUT HESITATION!!!

Good enough for me. Thank you for explaining, I would have just ignored 
any accusation if it was me, whether it was true or false. There is a lot of dirt 
under the rugs here in S.F. and the secret to keeping-on seems to be the ability 
to handle dirt gracefully and in good humour.

A Punk panhandled me in the Haight today and I asked him if "Punk was 
dead" and he said "I'm still alive" and I told him that a Hippy had told me it 
was dead, and he said "tell the Hippies to go home!".

I'm spinning records at Soupstock in GGpark Sat. and Jen of SPAZ told me 
that there will be punks that hate rave music there - come watch me kick all 
their asses!

        I have gone through the very same experience here, though it was in
my sculpture class wherin i did a project that was BARELY rave-related.
People started talking about the superficiality of things and emotions
present at parties, the massive drug use, the 'faddish' nature of this, the
fact that one HAS to be on drugs to 'get it' (whether that's the music or
the feeling in the air, etc).  It really got me down, i'm used to being
around open-minded people and it's funny but we're always given this
stereotype of "ARTISTS" as being the one's who are 'out there' and live in
a context in which 'anything can happen.'  THAT, in my experience, is a
complete fallacy.  I've met more ravers who were math students, genetic
biologists, commerce students, whatever, who were open to new ideas.  A lot
of "artists" (at least at my school and in my experience) would rather sit
around and complain about how shitty things are, sit self-righteously on
their priviliged upper middle class throne and hand down platitudes to the
masses trying to get them to change rather than taking a hard look at their
own behaviour, and trying to set an example for others.  IMHO, making
objects will not change the world.  Being involved in group experiences and
LIVING with core beliefs such as PLUR might be one of the few things that
can change the present societal structure.
        My response to the class was that 'raves' have different impacts on
different people, for me they have irreconcilibly changed my life for the
best.  I didn't get angry at the class or the 'doubters' but only said, i
understand your opinion but maybe you should give 'raves' a second thought.
To be hostile and exclusionary (IMHO) would be antithetical to PLUR-ish
beliefs and THEN they would be right in saying that 'ravers' are just a
bunch of confused kids with some half-digested spiritual mumbo-jumbo in
their heads that is preached and not lived.  I guess what i try to do is
set an example as best i can.

        peace,
                brad

all night, some didn't beleive me but oh well, there will always be

Okay everybody - I have a brainstorm thundering in my head and I *must* 
share it with you.  

Some friends and I in Sacramento have been thinking about getting out and 
doing some camping this year.  I remember last year going to Muir Woods 
and on the way, my friend and I noticed an incredible camping site.  It 
has a small parking lot, lots of room for tents and best of all: an 
ampitheatre type place with a BON FIRE in the middle.  I thought to 
myself, what a place to have a gathering of many friends!  

Now that summer is drawing near, that same idea came into my head.  I've 
been sharing a real connection with people lately and I want it to 
continue even more.  I had originally planned on just a few close 
friends, but the more I think about it, the more I'd like to connect with 
friends I don't know as well: my friends on sfraves and their friends!  

What this would be is a weekend in mid to late summer and it would not be 
a rave, but simply a gathering of people to come together to share ideas, 
experiences, and dreams.  All of us could bring drums and other 
instruments, and maybe a portable stereo & mix tapes.  The campsite is 
walking distance from the ancient redwood forest of Muir woods, and that 
night we could all come together for an incredible learning experience 
and inner growth for all.  Then maybe top it all off with a sunset party 
on Sunday......  Am I being idealist, or does this sound like just an 
incredible idea of people coming together to SHARE with one another - to 
connect?  I want your imput, thoughts and comments on this because I'm 
gonna do it!  

makin' that
PLUR occur! :P

Amy

Looks like a cool weekend for a few (sunny?) outdoor events - Positive
Society and Golden Gate Park on Saturday, and hopefully Sunset on Sunday.
Kundalini, Stompy and Diverse City should all be OK too, and then
Come-Unity on Wednesday.  Too bad I'll miss all of them since I'll
be out of town.

Caught Dust last Friday - Ethan spun a good set, and I liked the
intimate environment (a fresh space, at least for me).  Simply Done
last night was pretty good too, with Suiki and Mark Farina, the crowd
was a bit weird but entertaining.  You'll have to go sometime to see
what I mean (unless it was a freak occurence).

Also, I've gotten more images into the web pages.  Promoters (or
anyone, really) can send me little uuencoded GIFs if you want them
included in the web page.  Otherwise, you'll have to rely on me liking
your flyer enough to scan it in...

Dear sfravers,
You all probably got a letter a couple days ago about the computer virus
"Good Times".  Well it was a hoax.  I swear I'm not lying either because my
father works for the computer company Amdahl and they sent out the warning
they received from the FCC, only to receive a second letter from the FCC
saying that they had made a mistake and that it was a hoax.
Also, I would like to invite evryone on this list to come see my school's
production of Hair.  It opens tonight at 7:30pm and runs until Saturday.  If
anyone wants directions e-mail me.
Love,
The Elf Queen

Just heard that Genesis was injured in a fire in LA at Rick Rubin's
studio. Anybody know more about this, or if he still has an email
address at the Well, (he posted to sfraves for a short time quite a
while back, don't know if he still subscribes).

That's about right. Psychic TV were in LA to do a show (that got cut
short, incidently, when Genesis passed out on stage 45 minutes into the
set) and were invited to stay at Rick Rubin's mansion by Love and Rockets,
who were recording an album there. Early Monday morning the mixing board
(the fire department speculates) sparked and set the studio on fire. All
of the people in the house woke up in time to get out except for Genesis,
who had to jump through his window to get to safety. I left LA on Sunday
night so I didn't see any of this, but I hear he has a lot of broken
bones. Poor guy--what an unlucky weekend.

the Fraser Clark lecture - be forwarned about the room capacity! Also note 
the warnings in Alethya's post and here about the serious lack of
public parking ...

Anyone going to Kundalini tonight?  They want $20 after 12a.  Wow!  It
sounds like a good line up but I am wondering if I can't find something
equally good that's closer to SF and a tad bit lighter on the wallet. 
Any comments on previous events put on by these folks that would help
me decide on way or anther???

Thanks,
Bradley

                   As you all know , today (Saturday) is Food Not Bombs'
annual free festival "Soupstock" .It's at the Bandshell in GG park and 
will feature a stage with live bands , free food , info stalls , and 
S.P.A.Z.
                   If you would like to bring donations for Food Not 
Bombs , they would would very much prefer CASH rather than food ,as they 
are well supplied with food from many S.F. restaurants , bakeries , and 
co-ops but are always needing cash for operating expenses (gasoline,van 
repairs,bail money).
                        "take what you need , give what you can"
                                              peace!!

I was wondering if others can relate to this.
I enjoy having conversations with others at raves, but sometimes find it 
to be a bit of a struggle, especially when the music is really good.  
When the music is really good, I sometimes find it difficult to be more 
consciously present with that person.  The music can sometimes cause my 
consciousness to start to merge with the music and overall surroundings, 
making it more difficult to focus on the conversation.  At this point I 
find it more natural to converse through dance, rather that with words.

Last week I went to a beach party near bonnie doon, and enjoyed having 
conversations with the people that remained after the music stopped.  I 
found it much easier to be more fully present with the verbal 
conversations.  This is one of the things I appreciate about net.  We get 
to converse in an enviroment that we can create for ourselves that makes 
it most comfortable for our verbal conversations.

One of the things I love about raves, is the amount of communication that 
takes place, which seems to happen in many different ways and on many 
different levels.  Sometimes after a raves I think about some of the 
different interactions and connections through communication.  Some 
through a look, a movement, sound, many different expressions.  
Oooohhhh, the joy of making connections.
:)

Well we were hoping to play out on the beach, but it's looking a little 
soggy...

So we'll be doing a new moon party tonight at an indoor location in the city!
Starting at 10, going till 3ish and hopefully beyond.

Bring happiness, your friends, and someone you barely know.  
And fimo.

Call the voice mail, (415)267-3076, for more details.

[ to sfraves list ]

 Looking at some old SFRaves mail , I read again Peter Fogel's mail 
about dancing apart from music. It reminded me about something I 
occasionally wonder about. 

 Only twice can I remember seeing someone at a rave who didn't have
the use of his legs - both times in a wheelchair. One of the times
was Malachy , and he doesn't count because his was a temporary
condition ( I hope ). The other fellow seemed to be have been
brought by his friends , and he seemed to be having a great time.

 Can raves be a place for those who can't dance with their legs?
I can't remember when I've seen someone in crutches or a wheelchair
at a rock show , but maybe raves? They have sports for folks in
wheelchairs - basketball, skiing (!). I think it'd be cool to see
a floor full of folks bopping away in their wheelchairs! And , since
they have racing wheelchairs now - zip!zip!zip!

at Megatripolis/London we have a regular wheelchair raver in the form of 
Greg Sams, an american actually.  he gets right up on his wheels and 
wheels about.  great to watch!
I also once came across a miracle rave cure to do with a cripple.  I 
can't remember why or how he was injured but he was paralysed from the 
neck down.  anyway his freinds noticed that he did show some kind of 
response to rave music and took him to a rave.  there this friend of mine 
noticed that he was kind of bopping his eyes and head to the rhythm.  
almost a year later my friend bumped into him again at a rave and this 
time he was functioning from the waist up and really going for it in his 
wheelchair.  another year after that, my friend (Sequenci, my alltime 
favourite DJ as a matter of fact) was DJing when this raver came up to 
him, jumping about in an ever so slightly spastic way:  "you don't 
recognise me, no?  I'm that guy in the wheelchair, remember?"  anyway he 
claimed (and I believe him) that raving had saved and cured him.
zip!zip!zip!

Dear All;

	Before I go further, I'm just posting an idea, not a fact, and am
looking for feedback on it, in the group forum. The tone of this post is
happy:), curious:), relaxed:) ...etc:), please to do infer anything else
about my writing, unless you are unsure of its meaning and then first ask
me in private to carifiy what you thought I wrote, or wrote so poorly 
that you couldn't understand it, before publically frying me butt, :). Ok 
nuff said. 

	I was thumbing though the SF Guardian, and came across an ad for
DJ/VJ Master Mixer, Doug Wendt, and his exclusive "All World" Music &
video dance Party. I thought about how nice it would be for an average
person, non-raver, non-lurker, earth ...etc, to be able to go to the
community section and have SFR Calendar in what ever form the paper would
except it, there along with the rest of the community happenings like Art
Shows, Rock & Roll ...etc. What follows are the PRO's & CON's as I see
them, please do make additions, rebut respectfully, and lavishly praise
where deserved. I'm looking for all and welcome them always:

  PRO's

	1. It would bring in a much greater diversity of peoples both
enomically, intelectually, and racial. With this increased diveristy, more
raves will be held, at bigger & better venues. R-Culture would be more
widely accepted, and tolerated, and finally we as members of this 
subculture would have many more allies/help/recourses. The benefits 
mentioned would go to peacefully defend ourselves against the police, help 
out local & nation charites ...etc. 

  CON's

	1. With the increased diveristy and public awareness, comes the 
negative/destructive elements of society, also more commerializum.
               
	2. Events would seem to big, & lacking intimacy, but most of our 
large scale events do that anyway.

	3. No more underground theme/feel, with an ocassional renage private 
party for our scene elders.

	4. Cost to put them in the paper each week if any, and would they
even let us do it. 

		_____________________________________________

	Ok theres a start, personally I'm all for keeping things as low
keyed as possible, I get my calendar every week and am just happy as a pig
in shit. I have no trouble keeping our scene nice & usually comfortable
the way it is, I prefer intimacy over hype anyday. I like my raves small,
either indoor or out, house party like. Being selfish isn't always negative.

	But we talk about the fact that diversity/acceptance/tolerence are
some of things were about, and that thats important to us. But the fact is
that most of the people in my circles when I talk about "RC" they think
I'm talking about Reevaluation Counseling, which is like AA, but very
different. With the numbers of people who show up so our events sometime,
the word is definately out there on the streets. Word of mouth adversing
is one of the most effective forms there is, and offers each person with
the knowledge the opportunity to filter it to "kind" people. 

	So I quess this comes back to an age old ?, why are we here, and 
what do we want rave culture to be, today, and in the future(only *YOU* 
can answer that one). Or is it just here so we can have a good time, 
right now(: no negative images meant :)? God knows I need a good time:)

	I would like to see R-Culture(ew ew a pun silly me) as an
**active** force, for spreading fun, positivity, peace, love, tolerence,
"awareness", and trust, though out our world, while having a great time.
But that's just my opinion. I would like to hear your PRO's & CON's about
publically posting our parties and your vision, (a few sentences to save
bandwidth please) of R-Culture. I just ask that they be your own honest
clear thoughts, not your parents, not your friend the DJ ...etc.
Feel/Thing(Phinking, B. Darkness Word) about what it really means to you,
what you would like see changed today, and where you would like to see
R-Culture in say 5 years, maybe 10, and please take your time. 

	No matter what we all say here R-Culture has its own path and
destiney, just like you and me. I just want to see whats on peoples
minds and in their hearts, with regard to our scene, a groups energy, 
their intentions, and dedication can acomplish great things. If you 
want to write more than that send it to me privately, cool.

At first, I thought posting the SFR Calendar in the newspaper would be a 
really bad idea.  Your pro's though suggest otherwise.  The diversity 
issue is not one I pay much mind to simply because it is too hard to 
gauge fairly.  However, the public's perception of rave culture may be 
given more credibilty if it sees rave events being publicized in so 
public a forum.  With credibilty comes respect, and perhaps this would 
lead to less trouble with the cops.

> 	1. With the increased diveristy and public awareness, comes the

There are many raves that are already quite commercial.  With more 
events, you'll be able to pick and choose--thus avoiding ones you know to 
be more "corporate".

> 	2. Events would seem to big, & lacking intimacy, but most of our

Some events would be huge and unintimate, and others would not.  You 
can't really apply this argument to the entire scene.

The possibilty exists that this could backfire horribly.  The fact is 
that there *are* some people who choose to use drugs at raves, and 
allowing the "public" (whoever that is) to evaluate our parties expects a 
certain amount of objectivity.  Many people's minds slam shut at the 
first sign of anything out of the ordinary, so...

Inconclusively yours,

	Sami

abso-fucking-lutely!!  the other guy you occassionally see is probably mark
evju, our long time raver & psychonaut buddy from santa rosa.  he used to
be around in the scene alot more about a year ago and now only drives his
van down occassionally.  he's got more energy and good vibes for ravin'
than many people we've met throughout the scene.  yes, you can dance
without legs...it's a spiritual thing, ya know? 
 
peace&positivity,

One of the concerns I have about throwing raves into the mainstream 
public with big commercial parties is that these may not turn out to be 
what I consider raves. 
I could be wrong about this, but it seems that alot of the mainstream 
public uses alcohol to reduce their inhibitions.  There very well may be 
alot of alocohol use at a big commercial party.  This doesn't have to be 
a horrible thing, but with big numbers of people drinking the chances go 
up of people not be able to deal with the high energy vibe in a peaceful 
loving manner.  The media will probably focus more on the negative 
aspects like people being out of control and getting into fights.
Actually techno and house music is played in mainstream clubs now.  Are 
these raves because of the music?
Does calling a PUBLIC event with techno and house music a RAVE make it a 
RAVE?

Sorry if I sound a little pessimistic this morning, haven't had my 
morning coffee yet.

I share Peter's concerns about alcohol consumption at public events. 
Drinks are where businesses really make their profit at dances, so 
drinking would probably be encouraged by commercial promoters, which ain't 
very ravey.

Last night we went to 1015 to hear Andrew astralmatrix's new song he wrote 
for Terrence Toy. Saturday night at 1015 is very far from being a rave, it is 
very much a pickup scene. They are listening to much of the same music but 
they mostly dance as couples. Terrence Toy is one of my Favorite House DJ's 
and he has been spinning for as long as house music has been around. He 
has been to Come/Unity and Stompy and he would love to play a party where 
the vibe is so strong and the music loved. (Terrence even played the song first 
so we could get out of there)

i can't help but to think that a subculture is a subculture is a 
subculture. And it must follow it's nature as that, even at the expense 
of dying out in years to come. I stumbled upon techno/trance/ambient 
music, and thus _found_ raves. It is something that people discover and 
arrive at. I don't expect it to survive indefinitely, and that is why I 
love it so much--it is * our zeitgeist *, everything about it is born from 
the conditions we are living in. I believe it must follow its natural 
course. One or two events of the year can probably afford to be public, 
and certainly we as individuals should not lose touch with mainstream 
america--mainstream _is_ America after all, but leave it be.
A flower grows through a rock because it was its destiny, not because  we 
forced it to.

love and evolution,
eugenie

Does anyone know the copyright laws about making mix-tapes?  How can DJ's 
make tpaes with published music on them, without paying royalties?  Or do 
they pay royalties?  Any ideas?

 It would be an interesting experiment. Some recent posts worry about
alcohol and the events getting too vibe-less - if the "cart is kept
BEHIND the horse" - i.e. , the raves listed in the SFRaves calender
keep the goals as vibe first , "mainstream" acceptance & alcohol sales
secondary , then I see no trouble.

 [ Imaginary ideas for making raves more "mainstream" -
   1. WET T-SHIRT NIGHT!
   2. Jaegrmeister shots only 75 cents before 11PM!
   3. WET BOXER SHORTS NIGHT!
   4. "Rave" dance contests!
   5. Arm wrestling night! ]

 BUT - With the overcrowded F&F event of recent times as an example -
some of the parties mentioned in SFRaves may not be set up for crowds
of folks showing up. Select "publicity" to keep crowd size down is
deliberate in those cases. Some editing of the weekly calender would
be required before it could be sent to the paper.

Dear All;

	Thanks for all the great responses to the idea about posting our
SFR Calendar to a newpaper like the Guardian, and keepem coming. I agree
with what most of you have said to varing degrees. 

	Eugenics point that techno is here to stay I feel is an acturate
one. Though I do feel there can be a laspe in popularity, for example I
was a part of the punk rock scene in Philadelphia, PA during the late 70's
early 80's. After about 83 - 84 the scene kinda died out due to no more
Hardcore Halls, & Clubs caring not to want to deal with the uppity nature
of the clientel(great spirit bless their narly little hearts, the punkers
everywhere that is). But the more people I meet who are about 10 years
younger than me are all into that music, so its kinda weird, that it took
another 10 years of listening to the same old super groups, before
mainstream radio, back east, to finally recogized them. 

	When I was heavily into it, punk rock I couldn't even image what a
Dead Kenneys CD would look like, today you can get the complete
collection, in a boxed set no doubt. Very similar to the way techno is
today, everything being primarilly or vinial, or cassette. I hope they
don't make the same mistake they did with "new wave/punk rock". Because 
the real shame there is that a lot of the really ggod bands are either 
MIA, dead, insane. or just out of the biz, or doing other thing musically.

	I'm a little disappointed that no one I've read yet, has told me 
about what their vision of our scene is today, and 5 - 10 years what they 
would like it to look like. I'm sincerely interested in your ideas, the 
scene belongs to everyone, so I feel everyone should have a say. I 
promise I won't flame you, invalidate you Phinking, or even laugh; unless 
you intented it to be funny, promise, cross my cpu, and hope for an 
electrostatic discharge. If your still shy, send it to me privately.

	As far as the alcohol think goes, I don't like booze, booze
doesn't like me. But I do understand that a lot of people enjoy the
comsumsion of booze, and do it responsibly. My response is that there are
penty of places to go to drink booze & listen to house, techno ...etc, why
do we have to be like everyone else who serves alcohol, R-Culture prides
itself on being different, I think in our world, that we as a race of
beings we should be able to go to an techno event, and not have booze offered
to us, or accept it, and just ask the people who drink to bring there own,
its cheaper anyway, it saves the booze consumers money, and we make a
statement to the General Public that alcohol is a dangerous drug, much
more dangerous than some of the illegal ones, especially in the hands of a
Fratt person, on testostrone OD, with a 5.0 liter. I think thats 
what a lot on Con Alcohol ravers would like to see happen, anyway. 

	Of course most of the promoters would have a shit fit, not 
allowing them to serve alcohol at a big big event, try some other 
night to make your 200% profit, and on another group of people.

	There some reasonable, aware promoters in the bay area, what 
little dealing with Martin of Communion, I've had has always been open 
for neogiation. Opps and need I not forget Ethan of F&F, whos crediabilty, 
and dedication to our scene speaks for itself. I can't speak for him, but 
I'm sure if you had a reasonable political agenda you were bringing with you 
to a big event that he would definately here you, or do something like 
makings the booze proceeds go to things like, Ravers Defense Fund, or 
MADD ...etc

	So please respond to the 2nd set of ?, it gives me a lot of
information about how people feel about techno & raves, and what they want
to do with all this wonderful positivity & love, today and in the years to
come. But its still ok to want to keep it all for yourself, any change is
scarey, and somethings can happen as a result of change that make it
impossible to go back to the way things where.

Guess what me found today?  I found a nice little list of upcoming Orb 
U.S. concert dates.  I just received the latest keyboard magazine, 
complete with Orb cover story.  I opened the mag to read the article, and 
lo and behold, found the following list.  And away we go!

May 30 - Masquerade, Atlanta, GA
June 2 - Venus de Milo, Boston, MA  <---------------***
June 3 - Roseland, N'yawk, N'yawk
June 4 - The Trocadero, Philly, PA
June 6 - TBA, Montreal, Quebec
June 7 - TBA, Toronto, Ontario (my kinda town)
June 9 - Phoenix Center, Detroit, MI (bring your combat gear)
June 10 - The Metro, CHITOWN, Land of Wonder, IL (fuck yeah!!!!)
June 12 - The Bomb Factory (NOT in Oklahoma), Dallas, TX
June 16 - Warfield Theatre (NOT in Bosnia), San Fran, CA <----------***
June 17 - The Shrine (wear your Fez), Los Angeles, CA


There you have it, folks.  Hope you're all within driving or flying 
distance to these shows.  

**Special disclaimer.  I am not, repeat NOT to be held responsible if 
something happens like the whole damned tour being cancelled like the 
last one.  Also, the jokes were meant to be jokes.  I don't want any 
E-mail bombs being sent to me.  I'm too young to die (plus who would be 
uncool enough to hurt a girl anyway.  PS - I also wear glasses too).

A while back, Spun released a mix cd.  The liner notes did not reveal so 
much as a tracklisting, indicating that he is not paying royalties (I am 
not certain about this, though).  It's a really complex issue, but if 
you plan on releasing a mixtape, you should at least include a track 
listing (credit where it's due...).

for anyone really interested they will also play in Seattle or Vancouver, 
I think the latter on June 22nd.  More info can be culled from lurking on 
nw-raves.

Dear Derek C;

	Hey Derek, just a minor correction Sunset's phone number is wrong
on SFR Calendar dated 04/27/95, it should be 415-985-5264 not
415-952-5264. The incorrect number is UPS. Don't ya hate typos.

	Does anyone know if Sunset's happenin today, theres no new info 
on the voice mail as of 2:35PM PDT. If so could you please pass it on to 
me, other # if there is one, location, time, ...etc, thanks, cool, see ya 
hopefully :)

What makes raves so distinctive is not the music (I can hear the same
music at home or in a club) but rather the culture and community.  I
like the fact that at a rave I see people that I know, get hugs from
people I don't know, as well as talk and dance with women who know my
motivation is not to pick them up.   To a great extent this is not
possible at a club.  A private party yes.  At a club no because the
underlying dynamics are different.

The ranks of the rave community will expand and contract as people pass
through various stages in their lives.  This isn't, of course, to say 
that all people will eventually enter (and ultimately exit) the rave
scene.  Some people never will.  My sense is that this is more an issue 
of personal preference.  It is really unrelated to age, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status (at $20 a pop it is pricing some people out of the 
market!), sexual orientation, political affiliation, religion (ok,
maybe not religion though I once heard about an all christian rave but
perhaps it was a joke??), body piercing, tatooing, etc.  Did I cover 
everything??? :>)  I see a great deal of diversity at raves.  In fact,
it usually seems more diverse than regualr clubs.  Adverstising isn't 
necessary to reprofile the demographics of the rave community.

As with most anything in life, if you want it bad enough, you'll put
forth the effort to find/get it.  This is certainly true of all illegal
or non-mainstream things (I am not associating these two things)
such as drugs, automatic or semiautomic weapons, alcohol if you're
underage, non-English language films, topic specific publications, and
raves.  Let's think about it for a second.  How hard is it to find a 
rave???  I mean, you can find posters or those little cards advertising
raves all over.  They're in record stores, clothing stores, hair 
salons, etc. (haven't seen them in the grocery store though)!  Sheesh! 
I mean, the only thing other they could do is put up a billboard
on the 101 and a full page ad in the WSJ.  And, don't forget that
hyperreal provides space to publish the weekly sfrave calendar on the
internet or that there are newsgroups and irc channels for raves.  That
makes it available to the millions of people with a pc and a modem (and
internet access).  I think raves are as a result becoming too 
popularized, too impersonal, and too mainstream.

Rave culture is on the outskirts of the mainstream.  That's where it
belongs.  That's how it differentiates itself from the establishment.
Why?  Because major elements of RC fall outside what is generally
accepted by society at large including but not limited to the use of
drugs or other intoxicants (illicit or otherwise), staying out until
very early in the morning (even on weekdays!), and so on.  There's much
more but my poor brain is still not fully operational after last night!
 
It seems RC is having an identity crisis.  One the one hand, people 
want to keep it underground and "exclusive" while on the other hand it
is being thrust into the mainstream by promoters who want to profit
from it.   I mean some of these guys (and the venue/concession owners)
are major profiteers.  Does RC encompass charging $.50 for a swig of 
tap water (like they were doing last night at Diverse City)??  No sign
of peace, love, unity, etc. in that as far as I can see!  I am not sure
advertising will get us where we want to be.  RC has to evolve but
it should evolve in its own way, at its own pace while maintaining its
original raison d'etre and spirit.  The risk of expanding too quickly
is the loss of those special qualities that are missing or not equally
evident in the mainstream.  To push RC unmercifully into the mainstream
by advertising raves more broadly will have a profound and irreversible
impact on RC (sorry for the meladramatic wording).  Then, a rave would
simply be another *club*.

Actually, tack onto the end of this list:

June 22 (Thurs) Graceland, Vancouver, BC

A local DJ, Markem (formerly of LA) is bringing them to his club night 
for the last date of their tour.  Rumor has it they'll be playing the 
afterparty as well.  Contracts are already signed.  Love to see you all 
here if you can't get enough...

Yes, and if you look in the pink section of the Chronicle, 1015 is 
advertised along with a few other clubs that list "techno" nights. So 
things are already being advertised, and you get the results as seen 
above.

Good day all.

I was having some thoughts earlier in the day of Web sites and the such.
I've not been on this list for much more than a month but I've found that
the thoughts and feeling presented are, if nothing else, facinating.

I've put together a small Web site that incorporates some of the feelings
and thoughts surrounding the rave culture.  I've incorporated some
philosophies and thoughts of my own.  I'd like to compile works from others
and post it as an extension to one of my pages.

I think that it's a bit "one sided" in that the page only reflect the
thoughts and feeling of me, yet I'm addressing the entire population of rave
culture...

My point is that I'd like to reflect the feeling and thoughts of all of you.
If you have any thoughts about this I'd love to hear them.

Thanks.  The page address is below.

I want to say that I really appreciate Bradley's post.  I must say that I 
agree that we need to evolve at our own pace and not be forced into an 
evolution that is not necessarily our choosing.  If we want to go mainstream 
than that is *our* decision and that is also a probability of more promoting. 
 Though, I am not suggesting that we will become mainstream, things like 
publishing all of our gatherings for anyone and everyone to join allows and 
invites people in large numbers who may not understand us and may not promote 
the community we have developed.  And let me say...It is the *best* thing 
going and probably the neatest thing I have ever experienced! :)  We have the 
opportunity to introduce people that we meet in the "mainstream world" to this 
community, as others have said, who may appreciate and promote our values.  We 
have an opportunity, and to some degree and obligation, to take what we have 
out there and find a way to integrate it into our mainstream lives.  Those who 
understand, are interested, or relate should be invited to join us and they 
will in turn bring people who have responded to them in the same manner.  We 
can evolve collectively, ever promoting what we believe in rather than being 
forced to adapt to new environments which we already know we definately do not 
want to be part of.

I don't want to sound too exclusive.  We take what we have, this incredible 
since of community which shares core values promoting -peace, unity, 
tolerance, love, etc. - and we share it with as many people as we can.  There 
are enough of us, growing larger every day to make an impact...I just don't 
want to see the door open and mainstream society, many with dominator vales, 
come crashing in.  There are no distinctions, as I see them, in our community 
- we are all wonderful people.  I would like to see us evolve in a manner that 
promotes and rewards this.

"Take a ride on the rhythm of love....:)"

So it's illegal for DJ's to play at clubs, and it's just a law not 
enforced?  What kind of policing of this is done?  Must not be that much...

What do I want the San Francisco rave scene to be like in 5 to 10 years?

That is a very difficult and easy question to answer.  Difficult in that 
the scene has changed alot since it began. It is always changing, it 
seems.  So many complain bitterly because "it ain't what it used to be."  
Well, change is the only constant - it's how you *deal* with the change 
that makes a difference.  Who knows what the scene will be like in 5 to 
10 years.  The music and attitude are a reflection of what is happening 
in the world at that time and what people *want* out of their scene.  
That could change drastically for all I know. We have no way of knowing.

The part that is easy to answer in what I want out of the scene in 5 to 
10 years is that I still want that incredible music, wonderful people and 
most of all - that Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.  I still get that 
today, even if the rave scene is quite different than from when it 
began.  It is all what you (as in everybody involved) decide to make of 
it.  There is my 2 cents for the evening.:)

love,
Amy

Hi JC!
There's jillions of people out there making illegal copies of copyright
protected music.  That's what most of the big DAT player debate was all 
about.  That's why to prevent pirating the movie industry has started to
scramble portions of the video stream on pre-recorded videos.  Of course,
the video industry has also considerably reduce their prices whereas the
music industry has not.  Music has only got more expensive even they are
using a much cheaper medium.  Figure that one out!  Net, net of it all is
that while jillions are doing it, I would hate to be the person they made
an example of!  :>)

SoundScape Review
-----------------

Well,   at the request of the Adravers,   I took my trek to Adelaide this
weekend and arrived at the airport on Thursday afternoon,  and was picked 
up by Cris and Barry at the airport.

I was immediatly taken to the Uni and given a tour of some of it's more
interesting places,   checked my Email,  then taken over to Simon's place.

While over there,  we hung out,  and listened to some really good trance
music played on a pair of 1200's.   After that,  I tried my hand and spinning
a few tunes,   but my unfamiliarity with the records got the best of me,  but
I did lay down some fairly well beat matched sets until I got bored.   I
would rather be at the business end of the turntables    :-)

Adelaide was much smaller than I expected,  but fairly spread out over a 
large area.    The Uni was situated near the Botanical gardens,  the
zoo,   and one of 4 very large parks surrounding the city.

Later that evening,  we went to a small club called "Heaven" to hear a 
DJ from Detroit,   but we got there while the line was still fairly 
long.   Instead we head over to another place and hung out before going 
back to check out "Heaven" again.

Eventually,  we get there,   but I was turned away at the door because of
strict dress code.   I eventually had to go over and pick up acceptable
threads and return.

WARNING!! Adelaide clubs have strict dress codes just about everywhere,
and there is NO SPECIFICATION for what is acceptable.   

I finally get in...  and discovered that the venue was very big.   One of
the biggest clubs I've been in in a ling time.

Mostly house music was on the menu,   but when the Detroit DJ finally went
on,   I wasn't that impressed.    Shortly afterward,   I was pulled away
by my host,   who wanted to go home and sleep.

I did the same (because i've beeen awake 2 days already),  and wanted to
to try and sleep so I can do a "no sleep" weekend.

On friday,  we go over to the venue to check it out...   The venue is an
old boat house,  where the Uni rowing team stores their rowing boats.

Upstairs,  it's used as a gym for weights,   rowing machines (of course),
and other athletic gear.    Downstairs was where the boats were stored.
It looked like it was going to take a long time to get the venue spruced
up for the rave,  but after a lot of hard work from everyone in AdRave,
the place was really done up excellently.

During the day,  I was running around giving interviews,  and meeting people,
as well as helping clean up the venue.   I also met the Mind Virus people,
and had long talk with Nick,  met a lot of Hacker types,  before heading
out to check out the local Adelaide club scene.

Friday evening...  was Discovery,  and Cargo Club.   By the time I got to
Cargo club,   things had fizzled out...  As usual,  we had a hard time with
the door goon.   He said "We are closed.." when we arrived,  but inside,
it was clear that at least 30 people were in there.   Aventually,  one of
the DJ's finally came out and insisted that we be let in...  The door goon
pointed accusingly to us and said "The only reason why I'm letting you in,
is because Adrian (the DJ) said it's ok".

As we go in,  the DJ was playing house,  but nobody was dancing.   So soon
after that,  we head over to Discovery.

At discovery,  we get the same treatment...   only this time,  Mr Steriod
head said "Can't let you in here... Improper attire".   All the while,
other people,  wearing even more grungery attire were coming and going.

That dude was either stoked up with Steriods,  or had a very bad day,  and
no convincing would make the asshole change his mind,  so we left.

I head back to Simon's place and did some net surfing,  using Nick's account
which is connected DIRECTLY to AARNET.   OmyGad!!  what a difference a fast
link makes....  As daylight approaches,   we go off for breakfast...

Later that morning,  we head over the boat house,  and started cleaning it
up for the party tonight.   I had another inerview with Adrian (the DJ I met
last night) who's working on a Techno magazine.   Did a lot o yoga and stuff
that afternoon before the party,  tuning myself up for a long evengings worth
of dancing.

Early in the evening,   it started to rain,   but evenutually made it back to
the venue...  Omygod!!  What a change...   The chill room was nothing short
of amazing...  Now THIS is a chill room.   Plenty of foam matresses,  and a huge
bean bag over in the corner.  Chairs all around the sides,  and a 400 watt
black light really made this a visual experience.  Although no music (which
would have been impractical,  due to close proximity to mai room),  it
didn't really matter.  What mattered was the abundance of nice soft places
to flop down on.

The main room had really good lighting...  with the sound system at one end,
provided plenty of dance space dispite is smallish size.

At first,  the crowd size was very small,  and I was asked to quickly go
somewhere for a short time,   but got back before nobody noticed me missing.

When I returned,  about 60 people had arrived,  and the vibe picked up 
considerably.   Some awsome german trance was on,  so I wasted no time in
getting on the dance floor.   WOW!!   my mind completly left my body
as I was wildly moving around.   Eventually they broke into Jungle,  so
took opportunity to take a break and schmooze around with the AdRavers
for  while.    But it didn't tke me long before I was out there on the
dancefloor again,  groovin to some pretty awsome jungle/breakbeat stuff.

The place was packed,  and those that arrived during that time,  got
turned away,  or were told to come back later.   There were times it
got fairly hot,   but the fans kept things cool and made it tolerable

After that,  Hardcore,  and I mean HARDCORE!!  Really fast.  hi energy
hardcore...  WOW!!  I went insane.   All evening long...  Fast Hard 
Hardcore.   I would have liked more Acid Trance,  thats what my biggest
complaint was.   Also,  the MC sort of spoiled my head space on some
tracks.   I remember hearing tapes of the Universe raves in the UK
with MC's but this is the first one I've been to that has them.   I don't
think I would like to hear MC's oll the time...   Its sort of distracting
at times.   I mean of they had something useful to say,   I suppose that
would be allright.

I would say it was 80% hardcore with a little bit of house towards the
beginning and the end.   

The rave went on well into the morning.   Even as we started to clean
up afterwards,  the music was going.    I danced al the way to the end.

So,  in summary...  Soundscape WENT OFF!!   Was really good!!   Hi 
energy,  great vibe...  And for me,  was well worth the flight and the
effort I made to get to Adelaide to meet the Adravers.

Venue - 9
Music - 8 (Could have more variaty)
Vibe - 10
Visuals - 8 (Chill room was INSANE)
Chill room - 10  (It even had a fan)

This compares very favorably with the SFRaves Friends and Family parties
and I sure hope there's more to come.

Congrats go to the Adravers for putting on such a wonderful party..
Sydney,  now it's YOUR TURN!!

Hi SFRaves.  I'm trying to think of some interesting things about last 
nights party at King st...
VIsual screen: I think it was Synergy and Pure or something and they had 
the usual multi layer thing but this was like everything!  At one point 
there was a computer generated landscape rotating and mirrored so you had 
this sense of travel forward, with a slide of a guys face in sunglasses 
flanked by a film loop of a pair of ducks flapping in place and some kind 
of pulsating glowy thing for his brain.  Whoa momma!
Maybe it was due to the fact that I haven't been out in a few months but 
I couldn't find the vibal energy on the dancefloor, just a whole lot of 
people dancing.  Not that there's anything wrong with that! better 
dancing than drunk driving.  One thing you gotta like is saying "stompy 
stomp" .  outside a young girl with I believe a new zealand accent asked 
me if I had been in "stuwmpy stuwmp" and if she could copy my hand 
stamp.  "What hand stamp?" I ask. Door people dissed me on that one. and 
I continued my stroll down the embarcadero reciting "stuwmpy stuwmp" over 
and over and over again...

I've been a lurker for some time now on sfraves, but finally feel the need to
add my 2 cents worth to the Mix Tapes question. 
This is part of a much larger controversy which came about when cassete tapes
first allowed a person to record published music without the artist getting
credit. It is still an issue and is getting more attention since  DAT tapes
now make it possible to reproduce without tape generation loss. As far as I
know it is officially illegal to record a published work even if you bought
the original copy yourself, if no royalties are paid to the artist. We all
know that is not enforced or we'd all be in trouble. Now I am definetely not
an expert so please inform instead of flaming if I got something wrong
(little sensitive me may go back to lurking if it gets too hot). What follows
is my own personal opinion.
Regardless of the legality issue which you may choose to ignore, there is a
moral one. 1/3 of my income in 1994 came from publishing royalties due to
being in the first version of a little known band called Counting Crows (she
name drops shamelessly). Now I am as guilty as any of buying and even dubbing
copies (double whammy) of mix tapes, and it is always with a pang of guilt
since I know that I am cheating some hard working Songwriter/DJ out there.
Publishing Royalties are a Songwriter's bread and butter. Since techno music
gets alot less airplay  and thus fewer Performance royalties than pop music,
I imagine Publishing royalties are alot more important to a Techno/Dance
music songwriter. in response to Jesus Chrysler's Post, as far as I know it
is not illegal for DJs to be playing published or copyrighted works, but they
are supposed to pay a licensing fee of some sort to ASCAP or BMI which are
the organizations responsible for keeping track of and distributing
Performance Royalties to the artist whenever their song is played (there are
changes going on in congress in regards to all this but I won't elaborate.
Anyone interested can Email me privately and I can send them info that BMI
sends me regularly). I believe that most nightclubs do pay this fee but
because of the nature of raves the artist never gets compensated as far as I
know. The first post regarding mix tapes mentioned the fact that song credits
are rarely included. I feel this is a shame for two good reasons. The first
is that if I like an artist I hear on a mix tape I would love to go out and
buy their CD therefore indirectly supporting the artist with publishing
royalties. The second reason is that if there are no credits, the artist
doesn't even get any recognition for the offspring he worked so hard to
create and was so proud of. Most artists I know feel this way about their
creations, as if it were a part of them. Where would we be without all of
these beautiful songs that move us so much (no pun intended). Let's put the
word out to all the DJs that we can, that we would like credits on the Mix
tapes so that we can at least give praise in our hearts (if not $ in the
pockets) to the creators of all this wonderful music.  
So take this for what it is worth, but whatever you decide let it be an
informed decision and one you feel comfortable with.

Love Lydia
(what is a rocker doing on this list anyway?!)
