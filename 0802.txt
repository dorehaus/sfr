I think you will hear hard "NON MINIMAL" techno at the Moksha Tribe party.

I hope we're not chastised by the techno community for it.

  Ok ok...  I guess what I was meaning to convey was that I haven't heard a lot of harder (i.e. non-minimal) techno in quite a while.  But regardless... there will be good music, that is the important part!

thought I'd sign back on to see how ya'll are holding up. I'm about to be in
SF for the weekend of February 9th, and was wondering if anything is going
on that weekend. Please say yes. Anyways miss you guys, know I caught up
with some of you on NYE at SomaArts, and hope to kick it with you soon. Take
care :)

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

I was driving people in on the casual carpool this morning and I  
noticed they built a really tall skyscraper right next to the Bay  
Bridge.  Shucks, it kind of screws up my view of the hills but I guess  
someone needed the office space, or assumed someone would need it.  I  
remember I used to ride in with this lady who would talk about how  
maybe even 30 or 40 years ago, there were all kinds of coffee roasters  
downtown under the bridge, and you'd drive in and smell fresh coffee  
everywhere.  Anyone ever meet this lady?  Older black lady, can't  
really remember much else.

hey folks,

donnacha costello has requested a XONE:92 mixer for his set on saturday.  we
have access to the 62, but would definitely prefer the 92, as would he.

does anyone on the list have one they could loan/rent to us for saturday
night?

in return we can offer a resonable rental fee and of course guestlist to the
party saturday.

we are also looking to rent/borrow a basic loop sampler (e.g. cycloops,
peavey grabber, redsound).

any help would be greatly appreciated!

the event in question is here:
http://www.kontrolsf.com/K32/K32H.jpg


thanks!

Dayum....that is a tall order! I hope that mofo works that Xone92 like mad. 
I can't honestly see why a 62 wouldn't work - but ya gotta do what ya gotta 
do, right?

May try and swing by this after seeing Joel McHale at Punchline tomorrow 
night...

Subject: [sfraves] The RIAA Wants $1.5 million per ripped CD

Well its not quite that simple, but they are seeking to increase the statutory damages they can receive through legislation known as the PRO-IP act.  Ever download a file from a P2P network?  If this legislation passes, doing that could ruin your life.  

So write your congress person and senator and tell them you oppose PRO-IP.

Not that it will help much since most of them are on the RIAA's payroll, e.g. Barbara Boxer, but I guess its worth a shot anyway.

Learn more about  PRO-IP here: http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/1368 

And here: http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080129-statutory-damages-not-high-enough.html

Peter

Well, they've sued thousands already under the existing laws...

This is just an attempt to change the economics of that campaign to be more in their favor.  Since litigation is the new recording industry revenue model, they need to improve the profit margins.  Under the existing laws, they can only get a few hundred thousand from the average file sharer and given that they lose some cases this isn't quite covering their legal costs.  

See http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/

Yah, I know I'm a brat for resurrecting an old-ass thread like this  
one.  But I just managed to download the legit, not camcordered by  
some guy in the theatre, trailer for ST11.  And I do recommend  
everyone else who participated in the thread do the same.

I still don't think I'm going to like the final look of the new "lets  
go and seek us out sum new life and kill it" Enterprise warship.  But  
this JJ Abrams sure knows how to tug on the heartstrings of a space nut.

You silly, it's already been posted on the official movie 
website in HD, not hard to find :-)

check it:
http://www.paramount.com/startrek/

(random SFR trivia)
Spencer Knowles, a well-known SFR-lister and behind the Warmth 
parties, and aspiring actor that found a few small bit roles 
in LA (Felicity?), had a non-speaking role as a *gasp* alien on 
a Star Trek movie. Sorry I forget the name but it was late '96-97.

The RIAA is ridiculous. They've been known for wanting exorbitant  fees for
their damages and most of their cases have been dismissed by the courts for
being utter bullshit. Good luck LOL

Doh!  When the trailer was originally announced I was looking for  
it... where else... on Youtube.  And I found endless fan-made fakes  
and the real one only a crap copy from someone's camcorder.

Sign of the times I guess, and a bit doofy on my part.  It really  
didn't occur to me to check Paramount's site until it was mentioned in  
the comments on a YT video of the thing.  After all, where else WOULD  
you go looking for video than Youtube?!?!?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Don't drive in rain with Cruise Control on

i've found the best way to avoid hydroplaning is when your car starts to 
drift, don't stomp on the brake. just take your feet off the pedals and 
let the weight of your vehicle make contact with the pavement again. 
this usually increases the friction again and your car just coasts 
through the puddles with ease. i don't know how many times i've seen 
people in front of me spin out in front of me because people think they 
should just jam on the brakes. i find this is also helpful in racing 
games too. `;)

She thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highway patrolman told her that if the cruise control is on when your car begins to hydro-plane and your tires lose contact with the pavement, your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed, making you take off like an airplane.

Alright folks, it's on!

It's shaping up to be a big night...there's a definite buzz in the air and
almost everyone I've talked to is coming out!

Here are a couple things you need to know:

1 - Fuck this rain! The Endup will have out heatlamps and two big tents on
the patio to keep you warm and dry.  That's right, hang out outside on the
patio, chat, smoke, do yo' thang, whatever. DRY. :)

2 - We are excited to announce the addition of a special surprise guest to
the bill!  Joining us will be none other that KOMPAKT's Tobias Thomas, all
the way from Cologne, Germany.  He'll be playing right after Donnacha, so
stick around for some of that pretty Cologne techno to take you into the
morning hours.

So, enough chatter.... let's do this!

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


featuring from Dublin, Ireland in an
exclusive North American appearance:

DONNACHA COSTELLO
*2 hour extended live pa*
(minimise . kompakt . force inc . mille plateaux)


"Well...that's enough. Fuck it." To anyone paying attention, those
words will instantly bring to mind one of the most unique and
memorable techno tracks of last year. The man behind it is Dublin's
Donnacha Costello, who has been producing for over a decade but
really came into the international spotlight in 2004 with the release
of his acclaimed "Colorseries", a monthly sequence of 10 color-
coded EP's created using entirely analog gear and released on his
own Minimise label. Influenced by minimal pioneers like Mike Ink,
Plastikman, and Basic Channel, Donnacha creates warm, dubby
techno that intoxicates the mind as it compels the body to move.
After witnessing his stirring live PA at the 2006 DEMF, we knew we
needed to bring him out to SF, but in the nearly two years since,
he's been nowhere near these parts. Tired of waiting, this month
we've finally decided to say "fuck it" ourselves and fly him over for
an exclusive North American appearance you definitely won't want
to miss.


plus special SURPRISE guest from Cologne, Germany:

TOBIAS THOMAS  (kompakt)

DONNACHA COSTELLO is many things to many people.

In the past he has been: Child, Brother, Pianist, Teenager, Guitarist,
Student, Techno Musician, Philosopher, Expatriate, Label Owner, Audio
Engineer, Bereaved, Ambient Musician, Visual Artist, Techno Musician,
University Lecturer, Composer for Film, Experimental Musician, Techno
Musician, Husband.

He has been releasing records since 1996 and his talent has long been
recognized by those in the know including Johnny Marr (Ex-Smiths) and Richie
Hawtin. The list of DJs who support his work reads like a Who's Who of
techno, many of whom have licensed his work for their mix CDs, most recently
including Ricardo Villalobos, Luciano, Magda, Tiefschwarz and Josh Wink. As
a live performer, and more recently as a DJ, Costello regularly performs
around the globe from Europe to the U.S. to Japan and runs his renowned
'MINIMISE' record label from his hometown of Dublin.


____________________________________________________


About Donnacha's recently re-issued "Colorseries":

The Colorseries was a series of ten records released in rapid succession by
Donnacha Costello in 2004 and marked the breakthrough point in his career.
The collection is special in that these records were produced solely with
analog equipment, without a computer in sight. The hand crafted coherence of
the music made and speed of the release process marked the series almost as
a stream of consciousness, with each color embodying a different chapter,
mood and season, with all elements inextricably linked to one another in far
more than just name.

Throughout 2004, the Colorseries consistently appeared in the charts of big
name DJs and eventually appeared in end of year top ten lists in many
publications including The Wire and The New York Times.  In the intervening
years, Donnacha has scored a number of hit releases, including last year's
unstoppable "6.6", and has broadened his fan base considerably. The
Colorseries CD will therefore appeal to those who were not around for the
original releases, those who have discovered Donnacha's work through artist
mixes or through witnessing one of his famed live appearances.  Minimise is
proud to present these tracks on CD for the first time, offering the
full-spectrum sound-rainbow for your listening pleasure. Colorseries
influences include: Farley Jackmaster Funk, Steve Silk Hurley, Inner City,
808 State, Plastikman, F.U.S.E., Aphex Twin, The Black Dog, Lobe, LFO,
Maurizio, Basic Channel, Model 500, Baby Ford, Mike Ink, The Modernist,
Studio One, Thomas Brinkmann.

You make it seem like not too many people know that. How did those people
get their licenses? Slamming the brakes when hydroplaning is comparable to
slamming the brakes when a tire goes flat. Is it not common sense anymore to
not slam the brakes when traction is lost?

Heh, at least it's not that bad here in the bay. In socal, chaos ensues on
the roads and highways during any rainfall. When it rains: the geniuses down
there liken to driving ~80 mph on the highway, while making sudden
lane-changes and making stops that I'd hardly consider gradual.

While driving on the 880 the Friday before last, my jaw hit the floor when I
got on the freeway and noticed the traffic flowing at ~50 mph. Not to
mention, the drivers up here are far more friendly than down south.

Except for the fact that it costs thousands to defend yourself even against a spurious case and also the fact that at least one case has resulted in an award of over $200,000 to the RIAA I would agree with you.

The RIAA is ridiculous. They've been known for wanting exorbitant  fees for their damages and most of their cases have been dismissed by the courts for being utter bullshit. Good luck LOL

Well its not quite that simple, but they are seeking to increase the statutory damages they can receive through legislation known as the PRO-IP act.  Ever download a file from a P2P network?  If this legislation passes, doing that could ruin your life.

So write your congress person and senator and tell them you oppose PRO-IP.

Not that it will help much since most of them are on the RIAA's payroll, e.g. Barbara Boxer, but I guess its worth a shot anyway.

it never was.  most people memorize the driving booklet for a few 
minutes, then forget everything.  or they paid off the dmv guy.. 
that's my theory.  there's an astonishing number of poor drivers 
here.  I've narrowly avoided accidents because people actually wait 
until they're in the middle of a giant puddle before slamming on the 
brakes.  people think brakes make you slow down.  traction never 
crosses their mind.

wow, we really disagree.  I think the drivers in socal are better, on

yeah, when it rains, people in the bay drive 50 tops.. in the passing 
lane.  so people that aren't handicapped by wet roads have to go 
slower than the stupid fucks. great.

I think the best drivers are in New York.  San Francisco drivers are  
too cautious and you got a lot of people driving in the fast lane at 55.

Ha!  Try Florida... where half the population is on death's door in  
the first place, and 55 truly IS a maximum speed for most of them.   
"Forty-five, stay alive" is the motto in huge swaths of the place.

As for New York, who in their right mind would WANT to drive there in  
the first place?!?!?  I can think of more productive ways to aggravate  
myself to the extent that driving there would send me to.  And when in  
the name of Cuthulu's butthole is it even possible to get UP to 55 in  
New York???  Many years ago, I took a couple of redeye flights into  
Newark.  And even in the godawful early hours of the morning, when no  
one who hasn't been up all night partying should be awake, I don't  
think I the cab taking me into New York ever broke 45!


cya,
john

The drudge link shows the roll-call. It includes Santorum (R-PA) in  
the Yeas. Santorum is no longer a senator. When was this vote held?

There's actually two bills, one that Santorum voted on in th epast regarding the NSA eavesdropping and the more recent one related to stopping torture and pardoning those that might have commited war crimes, i.e. torture.

Subject: [sfraves] WR: My yuMMy Saturday :n)

So in the afternoon... had a small gathering w/ some Familia in OaktoWn &
lololmao... it was so Dope!!  Love y'all :)

Then i dunno... so like the lil gathering didn't take that long & stuff,
so after kickin' it for a while i guess... well... I mean... it was way
mondo early & stuff, so i just headed to the City & figured I'd find some
mayhem to get into before the club started.

So in short (I'll like mondo try), I sat & spoke to a Scientologist for
about 45 minutes about my life & he told me ways to understand what I'm
going through & that i can visualize & make happen & he gave me a
personality test w/ a free $100 meeting/ session.

After that, walked around SF Center for a bit, but no bueno 'cause i
didn't know why i was wondering some place i had no monrey to burn... so i
thought about food & walked to McD's to use my McD's card... no bueno
either 'cause only had 78 cents on my card, so i ended up @ DonutWorld &
hd a donut while i chilled out there & called My Mona in AZ & well... we
talked 'til my Dad's cell phone was low on battery... so like i managed to
kill like close to an hour & 1/2 of like dodling around Market, which
wasn't bad... but it was hard tryin to come up w/ ideas, so i just headed
to Anu & figured why not...

So i went to Anu & chilled w/ Paul, the semi-new bartender/ barback dude &
it was chillin' with him!!!  He was all like doin' the bartender flares
tricks & he told me heeella funny stories & it was just a good time
chillin' with him 'til the Still Doin' It Started :)

So by 9AM.. Kuze got there & starts spinning like this trippy kinda deep
tribal proggy house.. them closer to 10 he got into some Dopelike almost
atmo jungle :)  DJ Ric got on next & continued the chill Jungle stuff then
got kinda ummmm i wanna say tech steppy kinda stuff... ummm... the DJ M
went on & did his lil laid back jungle set...

OK... then STUNNA went on & played out the rest of the night.. he started
out well.. kinda chill, was all like dubby & stuff, then after that.. it
was aaaall over... ok... Hello 2Day... he went hard like after the 1st
hour, then kept that goin' on for a while, kinda went Raga, but not too
much, then like ok.. in the middle of this set, he busted out this like
atmo-ish kinda spacey breakcore stuff & from there, he went strait on into
fuckin' GHETTOTECH!!!  Yeah... he went there, i was on the floor yellin'
my ass of & dancin' up a fuckikn' storm 'cause the ghettotech scared
people off the floor which meant more room for me to get my groovy on & i
took full advanteage of it.. & i mean.. he kept that up for a long
while!!!! Hello 2Day Fuckin' YUMMMMM!!!!!  He went back to hard jungle
after that to fin & kinda went Anthemy-ish.. lol.. his last track was a
Soldja Boy rmx & LoL.. it was just Dope!!!  LoL!!!

I mean.. it was Dope... like i mean... Stunna & I been like these mondo
online Homies for a cuple of years now & I've never seen him spin out here
& dunno why i'd miss it when he'd be here... but yeah... finally!!!  LoL..
we had like alot to talk about & it was just Ill chillin' w/ him!!! 
See... like he does heeeeeeella radio shows too on the net... & I told him
I would listen to him for a whoel week 'cause I wanted to save the
yummy!!!  Yeah.. my plan worked 'cause i was up in the Crazy fuckin'
maddness he busted out @ SDI!!!  Dope Dope!!!

The whole night was pretty sick... alota Jungle Familia came out & some
old skool faces made appearences too!!!  YAAAY!!!  So Dope!!!  It was a
good vibe... totally fuckin' good!!!  The dancefloor was pretty bumping
from like 11:30 on ;)  Yeah man.. i'm still like hella afterglowin' from
such a Groovy night!!!

Luckily... my Homie Ryan, who barely goes out, was there lastnight 'cause
he's a big Stunna fan:)  So after the club, he gave me a ride home, which,
'cause of my slight case of motion sick & still fuckin' kinda drunk,  was
totally just no beuno... he drives reeeeally well like, ya know when
someone just drives bad & it either freaks you out or you just get sick? 
Well.. i was kinda both & ooh man.. i swear, if i puked wheni got home,
probably woulda been so much better... oh well!

But I woke today still like hella afterglowin' from lastnight!!  So YUm!! :)

Hope y'all had a Groovy weekend too :)

We are down to the wire. Can you call Senator Feinstein right now?
Look up phone numbers and talking points here.=20





Dear Friend,
By Wednesday night, the debate over government eavesdropping will end in th=
e Senate.
In less than three days, we will know who stood up for civil liberties and =
who failed freedom. Help put Senator Feinstein on notice before the Senate =
votes.
Our demands are simple and unwavering. Stay true to your oath to protect th=
e Constitution. Stand up against an overreaching executive branch. And, don=
=92t grant blanket immunity to huge corporations that sold out Americans=92=
 privacy.
Call Senator Senator Feinstein at (202) 224-3841 or any of these phone numb=
ers: San Francisco: (415) 393-0707Los Angeles: (310) 914-7300San Diego: (61=
9) 231-9712Fresno: (559) 485-7430 and say something like this:
I am calling about the spying bill currently being considered by the Senate=
. I urge you to fight for a bill that=92s constitutional and respects the r=
ule of law. Please vote NO on the current Senate Intelligence Committee spy=
ing bill, and keep telecom immunity out of any bill that comes up for a vot=
e.=20
Please reject any bill that allows for the warrantless surveillance or =93b=
ulk collection=94 of Americans=92 phone calls and emails.
When you are finished, log your call here.
Your actions have made a difference in this fight. Together, we have jammed=
 congressional switchboards, flooded the Capitol in a sea of email and buri=
ed lawmakers in a mountain of petitions.After all the twists and turns in t=
his debate, we are finally down to the wire. Every lobbyist, lawyer and org=
anizer at the ACLU is determined to win this fight, whether we have to do i=
t in Congress or in the Courts. But right now it is absolutely essential th=
at the voice of freedom be heard throughout the halls of Congress.=20
Please call Senator Feinstein right now.
Help us finish the work we started in December 2005, when the warrantless w=
iretapping program was first exposed by the New York Times. Together, we wi=
ll bring the government=92s surveillance programs in line with the Constitu=
tion and the rule of law.
We will be in touch later this week about next steps in this fast-moving le=
gislation.
Thank you for standing with us.
Sincerely, Caroline Fredrickson, DirectorACLU Washington Legislative Office
P.S. In the coming days, the Senate will have a series of votes on this leg=
islation and will debate amendments to their eavesdropping bill. After that=
, the House and Senate will reconcile competing spying bills.
To read more details about what=92s happening right now, go here.

Tecnics 1200 (pair) with my own autograph $2500

Hi, and thanks to all you rituos brothers for reading
my post. Yes, it is true, I am selling my DJ gear as I
need the cash. First up is a set of turntables (1200s)
played on by myself and with my own genuine autograph.
I will autograph them again in front of you and sign a
photo of you and me together if you buy them. I am
sure you know who I am - I am DJ Mars of San
Francisco!!!!!!! 
Now that I have your attention, I realise that the
price is high but what you are paying for is prestige.
I was a big trance DJ and still am but I don't play
much as the scene has gone down. People used to love
me and you can ask all the candy ravers. Times are bad
now so I must make money where I can and what better
than to offer a piece of me to you if you are an
admirer or just like me. 
The price is firm and I may also throw in a pair of
needles to sweeten the deal. 
FIRST COME FIRST SERVED!!!!!!!!! 
Cash only, sorry. 
Peace

Well, he does have lots of candy raver fans.  Maybe some of them make decent money now and think it's worth it.  It's worth a shot, eh?  

He shouldn't have told that sap story though, that really devalues the idea.

Can you confirm that this is a hoax, or just a hunch?

oh, I am not suggesting that this is a hoax - in fact, knowing Mars as I do -
I find this entirely believeable -

for those of you who were not around - Frequency 8 was originally 
launched on SFRaves -
Frequency 8 would not have happened without SFRaves - Frequency 8 was
the first regular trance party in the bay area - it happened every 2 
weeks - outdoors
for under $5 from April to October of 1996 - Frequency 8 was originally Mars,
MystrE and myself - I know the "Ego of Mars" - but this craigslist ad 
is a bit much -
even for him

oh, I am not suggesting that this is a hoax - in fact, knowing Mars as I do -
I find this entirely believeable -

for those of you who were not around - Frequency 8 was originally 
launched on SFRaves -
Frequency 8 would not have happened without SFRaves - Frequency 8 was
the first regular trance party in the bay area - it happened every 2 
weeks - outdoors
for under $5 from April to October of 1996 - Frequency 8 was originally Mars,
MystrE and myself - I know the "Ego of Mars" - but this craigslist ad 
is a bit much -
even for him

I have a serious question, and not trying to start a flame war.  I did go to
a few F8 parties circa 1997, but never when to any of their outdoor stuff.
How did you guys get away with charging money, when collectives like Wicked
+ other full moon sound systems (including SFR) did them for free?

we never felt that we were "getting away" with charging money -
the fact of the matter was that it cost us a couple of hundred dollars
to put these events on - from equipment and generator rental to
firewood for the bonfires to being able to buy the latest "cyber-trance"
imports - those German records were expensive - this was BEFORE
the F8 record store became a reality -

I would explain this to people on SFRaves each time I posted
the date and time of our next event - we would tell people we
were "hoping" for 3 or 5 dollars from each person who came -
and people never disappointed us - SOMETIMES we even had
enough extra money to go out to breakfast afterwards -  people
were GREAT about helping us move all of the equipment both before
and after the parties - it was one wonderful summer . . .

yo last time i saw MARS was in line at an expensive supermarket in marin 
county when i worked at the tower in marin 2 years ago. who was it that 
said in the rave-umentary, 'Intellect,' "never drink your own kool 
aide?" -oh yeah,  it was Mars. i don't think its so much as hard times 
as much as he cannot afford his rock'n'roll lifestyle anymore and 
turntabes have no meaning to trance djs who don't to tricks on them... 
other than tricknology. <sorry trance is an easy target>

i don't want to be a hater, mars was a good guy. i just think he 
underestimated the lifespan of his genre.. who knows, maybe techno will 
be passe' (sp?) tomorrow? if that were to happen, i'd be selling all my 
shit too.. or looking for a viable alternative.

I think it's at least fair to post that the CL post has been 
rebutted as a hoax:

--------

QUOTE(Jeff Rappaport @ Feb 5 2008, 12:17 AM)
My name is Jeff Rappaport and I'm Mars' partner in the F8gear 
website. I've just confirmed with him that the craigslist ad is 
a complete hoax and has since been flagged for removal. I know 
as a friend he truly loves vinyl and it's his preference when 
playing. Despite hard times in the vinyl market he still puts 
out records for the Diehards out there and was very surprised 
that people on Bayraves actually believed this ad to be true.

With this said, it will be a great year as Mars & Mystre have 
reunited and are currently working on a new album as well as 
touring again -playing CD's and RECORDS :)

F-8th in '08!

-------

um...okay!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Tonal: Midnight Blue - Tonal's 1 Year Anniversary!

One year ago we set out to put a new mark on the San Francisco scene with a
series of color themed parties by the name of Tonal that would feature our
favorite DJs from across the world.  After enlisting the help and input of
many of our friends and family, we decided to kick things off with what
turned into an insane underground featuring Q-Burns Abstract Message.  With
double the turnout we planned for and so many people dressed up in that
party's theme of Electric Blue, we knew we were on to something.

A full year later, looking back at what has been an epic run of events, we
decided it was time to bring back the blue theme for our One Year
Anniversary!  After a year that featured Justin Long and Shamrock Green,
Miles Maeda and Fire Engine Red, Matt e Starr and Pimpin' Purple, Troydon
and Poppin' Pink, Jay Tripwire and Groovin' Gold, Jeno and Fade to Black,
and finally Diz and Clockwork Orange, it's time for Midnight Blue with DJ
Fame!

Saturday, February 23rd

Rock It Science & Prismatic present

Tonal: Midnight Blue

Featuring:

DJ Fame (New York - Dubsided, Potty Mouth)

Tonal is very excited to welcome one of the most cutting edge DJ/producers
to emerge in recent years!  The only US artist with an EP on Dubsided, the
UK label which pioneered the fidget house sound, DJ Fame is coming live from
New York to tear our party to shreds!  From guest sets in every corner of
the globe, to his 4 year residency at New York's premier underground venue,
Sullivan Room, Fame has brought the more jackin' sounds of tech house and
electro to crowds of thousands across the world. A veteran with over a
decade on the decks, Fame's energetic performances showcase serious
technical ability combined with intense cuts, crazy loops, and other
turntablist tricks to bring a truly unique sound to the dance floor.

Plus:

Justin Martin (dirtybird, buzzin' fly)

Alland Byallo (kontrol, nightlight)

Leonard (tocadisco)

Andrew Phelan & Origami (prismatic, drop, amenti)

Yea, I was gonna say ... Mars is one of my myspace friends, not that  
this is related, but he requested to add me, I'm popular, see,  
anyway, he didn't look like he was downsizing out of DJ'ing, that by  
the way might be like a bike messenger selling his bike to make  
rent ... oxymoronico ...

well like julio says with a cup of coffee in his hand ... well yea,  
that's good, yea.

Does anybody have some good happy hardcore mixes (and yes I realize that some of you may cite this as an oxymoron)? I'm looking for the classics from like... 98-2002ish.

And again, yes, I am serious. Fer reals. Like... really, though.

(So glad Bam's gone so he can't use this as ammo.)

Heart,
Alida

what do you consider good?  I have anabolic frolic from hullabaloo 
11, but it's 96KHz, and there's MCing throughout.  2 files, 35 mins 
and 39 mins.  I'm not sure when it's from, looking at google I'd guess 99.

Somebody must really have it out for him.  The ironic thing is, that judging
on many people's interactions with Mars, they thought he did post the ad.
Maybe it's just the trance bashing bandwagon though...

here's a new "theory" - maybe all of the trance bashing had NOTHING
to do with the music - but MUCH MORE to do with how INSUFFERABLE
Mars could be when talking about it

the Mars I knew definitely could have posted that ad - clueless that
the arrogance of it might offend

Um...r u feeling ok Ms.B ?

Lemme see if my boy Ian (aka DJ Bezerker) has any mixes online. He is

Last night me and my brother went to Pho Dong in Redwood City, that =20
shit was good as fuck let me tell you.

Now for today's quote.  Don't email me and say I don't like gays.  I =20
think men are sexy just like you do.  I just didn't know people were =20
out there saying this about Anderson Cooper, he certainly has this air =20
about him on the television that he's a younger, strapping married man =20
that just so happens to have grey hair.  I was actually looking for =20
quotes about his CIA involvement but hey this will do.  Enjoy!

And don't forget to stop at Pho Dong, http://www.phodong.com and vote =20
for Ron Paul today!

I worked directly with Anderson Cooper and CNN. I realized something =20
was fishy there and decided to quit. All I can say about Anderson is =20
that he is a homosexual (his lover is latino) and he does have an =20
attitude of privledge. He walked around the halls of CNN as if he was =20
too good to speak to his lowly producers. He was definitely a tool of =20
the New World Order.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

Oddly, I find sifting through digi-dowloads online to be fairly similar to 
crate digging - only I never have to wait for an open deck to listen to my 
track on!!!

Some call it "purist"...I call it "stubborn".

With stuff like Serato out, there's no good reason for griping about 
digi-tracks.

That's a *really* big maybe.  In fact, I prefer the sound of digital.  It's clean and the definition of the highs helps break through crappy sound systems.

It's also not dependent on a pristine record and needles to sound good.  If you're listening to just records it may not be very obvious, but if you go from playing a well mastered digital track to an old record, it sounds like muddy crap.

  That's a *really* big maybe.  In fact, I prefer the sound of digital.  =
It's clean and the definition of the highs helps break through crappy =
sound systems.

  It's also not dependent on a pristine record and needles to sound =
good.  If you're listening to just records it may not be very obvious, =
but if you go from playing a well mastered digital track to an old =
record, it sounds like muddy crap.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: 1200's with signature = $2500

ok so,  i was right and wrong. mars is a good guy and he 'never drank 
his own kool aide'. and i should have known he would have never sold his 
ttables.. i have always heard that the F8 people have been sticklers for 
uber clean vinyl, never even touching the records other than at their 
sides. although when i hear scratchy records it makes my heart all warm 
and fuzzy inside for some reason. (my records are all marked up with 
notes, fingerprints and 'sort quick' wax).

sorry to anyone who may have taken offense to my comments. i was 
gullable. no hatin F8. although i still think trance is limited.. i 
won't take that back.`;P

feelin like a jackass,
sean.

It's worth the visit...I have been about 3 times now, and it's always fun. 
The sad thing is, the 1st time I went I knew exactly where I was going at 
all times from playing too much of the one Tony Hawk video game where u can 
skate Alcatraz, lol.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

"well-engineered" is what worries me. For me engineers !=3D artists (and =
vice versa), good example of that would be:

http://smiph.net/~smith/metro.jpg  Making the city work together my ass.

I mean what happens in 5 to 10 years? Super, HD or multiple channel =
audio will be the standard and all of a sudden these wavs or high =
quality mp3s will pale in comparison. Great thing about vinyl is that it =
is an analog impression with all the richness of the music for what we =
can and cannot hear. Dont let scientific definitions of what humans can =
hear define your creative process, that definiation will probably evolve =
over time.

If we kept all the music in current standard formats it bottlenecks the =
richness of the song to that very specific sampling and bitrate, even =
with evolving audio technology. Vinyl has no bottle neck and the =
playback equipment continues to improve. My father's 1950 jazz vinyl on =
my 1200s sounds better than the same CD.

Go vinyl! Go tube amps! Digital is handy for on the go and personal =
collections, but if you are an artist and have a passion for the best =
form of audio...stick with analog and dont let computers and technology =
cheapen the creative and artistic experience.

I mean if DaVinci had a PC, would he create the Mona Lisa in Photoshop =
or would he stick with his paints?

My $0.02,
-Smith

Vinyl = petroleum. Petroleum = finite resource and major source of 
pollution.

Sacrifice the minimal amount of sound quality you may or may not gain w/ 
analog to do something better for the world. Go digital.

This isn't something that comes down to being more artisitc...this is 
something that is just plain irresponsible at this point, and it's not 
utterly neccessary for life.

"well-engineered" is what worries me. For me engineers != artists (and vice 
versa), good example of that would be:

http://smiph.net/~smith/metro.jpg  Making the city work together my ass.

I mean what happens in 5 to 10 years? Super, HD or multiple channel audio 
will be the standard and all of a sudden these wavs or high quality mp3s 
will pale in comparison. Great thing about vinyl is that it is an analog 
impression with all the richness of the music for what we can and cannot 
hear. Dont let scientific definitions of what humans can hear define your 
creative process, that definiation will probably evolve over time.

If we kept all the music in current standard formats it bottlenecks the 
richness of the song to that very specific sampling and bitrate, even with 
evolving audio technology. Vinyl has no bottle neck and the playback 
equipment continues to improve. My father's 1950 jazz vinyl on my 1200s 
sounds better than the same CD.

Go vinyl! Go tube amps! Digital is handy for on the go and personal 
collections, but if you are an artist and have a passion for the best form 
of audio...stick with analog and dont let computers and technology cheapen 
the creative and artistic experience.

I mean if DaVinci had a PC, would he create the Mona Lisa in Photoshop or 
would he stick with his paints?

Laptops on stage fucking suck (which is ironic cause I play one in one of 
the live setups I use... the only one I can travel with really, whoops).

Figure out another way.

If you're gonna take away the skill and flash and fun factor of the parlor 
trick that is mixing on two primitive playback tools and a small mixer, do 
something new with it.  Seeing a laptop and a mess of cables just so 
people can play vinyl just like a DJ, but with music they just copied or 
maybe shopped... Derrick has it right, if someone figures out a way to 
make it look like they are busting ass and aren't possibly checking their 
email, I'm all for it.  Hasn't happened yet.

Everybody was telling me "oh, you'll change your mind when you see Magda".  
WRONG, she fucking blew goats and the setup was skipping (because Serrato 
needs accurate phase and frequency information it is *more* prone to 
skipping than a normal vinyl record).  Boring tunes, timid mixing, no real 
stage persona, and again, that blue glow on the face and obsession with an 
application none of us can see.

Honestly, I LOVE vinyl, but I think prefer some of the new Denon 
djworkstation/cd players to the vinyl+pc systems out there (at least htey 
get rid of the blue glow/might be checking email thing).  It's not digital 
vs. analog, that battle (hopefully) was declared a truce when a sampler 
would never be a 303, and vice versa... it's the problem with someone 
squinting at a computer trying to rock me, but I can't get over the fact 
that they just look like another hack trying to check in a build before 
midnight.

A part of DJing is what I'll call "performance viability".  With vinyl you 
can see them cueing, looking at the needle, digging in the crate, seeing 
whether they pick their records front to back, or actually shop stuff 
right there based on feel.  You just don't get a lot of that with laptop 
based systems.  With Serrato, they pick up the needle and put it back at 
the beginning... same record.  Only difference is they are picking a new 
piece of material in the computer.

Saying it's the same is saying the Antiques Roadshow is just like the 
Antique Replica Roadshow.  It looks the same, but it's different in a ton 
of very real ways.  The democratization of music is great, it's also a 
curse.  When you bought a pressed 12", someone loved it enough to put down 
several hundred dollars to get it mastered and pressed.  Usually a label.  
A distributor had to love that label enough to pick it up.  A store had to 
want that release in stock.  Names meant more, labels meant more, and 
nobody was putting out crap only a mother could love.

If you made it this far, you're sick.  But let me qualify the above by 
saying that I worked on the development of one of the first vinyl 
controller systems (MsPinky), was there when we demoed it for Naut Human 
and Q-Bert and always thought it was a fun quirky thing... that it's full 
potential would be realized by people like visuals artists controlling 
video playback, and that it wouldn't be a substitute for vinyl DJing, 
which is it's own unique skillset and still evokes a certain feeling that 
someone obsessing on tracklists on a laptop screen while still futzing 
with this dinasauric control media will never attain.

            *andy needs to stop writing run on sentences*

I'd herald this digital download age if it were bringing a lot of amazing 
music, but I'm hearing *less* good stuff in downloadland than I was 
hearing in my fave couple bins at the neighborhood shop circa 1998 on a 
week to week basis.  Some crusty DJs are holding on to vinyl cause that's 
the last time the system really worked for them, and to be honest, I don't 
blame em.  I think of the most amazing moments I've ever witnessed as a 
fan of both dance music and the artform of technical DJing, and almost 
none of them would carry over well to the newer setups.  Beat juggling is 
cheap when you've got loop points built into the UI.  Same for reverses.  
Doubly so because you can flip it in your copy and just play it through.  
Triply so because you could prerecord your most difficult "mix" tricks 
into the digital stuff you're playing back.

People have forgotten that DJing is fun, it's simple, it's something 
anybody can understand, but few truly master.  You show up to some house 
party with a box full of 12 inches and hose the place down with style, 
funk, class and talent...  the same decks the kid before you was playing 
on are now on fire with no change in the technology, just what you played 
and how you play it.  A person can easily understand how the record plays, 
where it's coming from, how the mix works, and generally what is going on 
with vinyl.  But working with such a simple honest little setup, you can 
wreck people's brains when you start doing stuff that is outside the norm.  
It's worth looking at when you see someone really good.  Dig, slap that 
shit on, make a tune out of the new track and the track that's already 
playing, get outta there, rinse, repeat.  Just a simple mixer, and two 
turntables... on these simple tools millions became whack, thousands 
became houseparty heroes, and a few became stars that people line up to 
see like the best bands.

The cuepoints, the drop down lists, the search terms and subdirectories 
pitchlock and effects and pre-playback pitch adjustments don't make it 
better.  They just make it easier.

Are we better off than we were then?  Not really, judging from when I go 
out lately.  Breaks is in a rut, techno is in a rut, house is in a rut, 
the best times I've had lately are stinky ass basement parties with some 
big dude dropping dub and dancehall 45s, often not even beatmatching.  
The average DJ has more tracks to choose from, is often a better technical 
DJ starting out, but can't drive a room full of people to frenzy cause 
they don't understand hypnosis, vibe, groove, energy, tension and flash.  
The tracks don't even allow it, almost every record coming out is either 
just plain not dance music, or so formulaic in it's short phrasing and 
canned length builds that it's frustrating on the dance floor cause you 
never let go of your sense of time passing.  Locked in time/space, locked 
in genres, locked in cliques, just locked... frustrating when you step on 
that dancefloor to be freed.

I don't want to wonder if they are using 128kbps mp3s or lossless or FS or 
Serrato, after a good set I want to know what they put in my drink or why 
I didn't think of that or why am I all sweaty and why is the sun coming up 
or wonder how I could possibly follow a DJ like that myself.

DJing was never about "good enough", it's the only artform where the best 
recordings of the best music in the world are open to you without having 
to understand how they were made or buying up a room full of gear... it 
should be AMAZING.  Bring it or stay home.  I guess the technology 
shouldn't matter, but I haven't been convinced.

I'm down with innovation, and if it means synthetic amber vinyl, bring it 
the fuck on. Just make sure the cost is the same as digital, cuz honestly, 
when I can have the choice of paying $1.49 - $3.00 per track vs. $10 - $15, 
I'ma go on the cheap each and every time.

Plus, w/ Serato or Final Scratch, I'm still playing "vinyl" ! HA!

Fine, keep the vinyl format but changeup to more environmentally safe 
material. Our library of congress has a permament baseline for mankind's 
knowledge IN vinyl format but using Tree-sap Amber, which has been tested as 
one of the longest lasting (environmentally safe) non-degrading material.

If we produce a synthetic version of Amber (again that will be safe to the 
world) or similar...I'm all for that. Despite what vinyl is made of (which 
is currently bad, yes I agree), the format is still the best of form of 
audio period. All these new digital formats, where did new analog formats 
go? Come on innvoation!

Vinyl = petroleum. Petroleum = finite resource and major source of

Sacrifice the minimal amount of sound quality you may or may not gain w/
analog to do something better for the world. Go digital.

This isn't something that comes down to being more artisitc...this is
something that is just plain irresponsible at this point, and it's not
utterly neccessary for life.

"well-engineered" is what worries me. For me engineers != artists (and vice

http://smiph.net/~smith/metro.jpg  Making the city work together my ass.

I mean what happens in 5 to 10 years? Super, HD or multiple channel audio
will be the standard and all of a sudden these wavs or high quality mp3s
will pale in comparison. Great thing about vinyl is that it is an analog
impression with all the richness of the music for what we can and cannot
hear. Dont let scientific definitions of what humans can hear define your
creative process, that definiation will probably evolve over time.

If we kept all the music in current standard formats it bottlenecks the
richness of the song to that very specific sampling and bitrate, even with
evolving audio technology. Vinyl has no bottle neck and the playback
equipment continues to improve. My father's 1950 jazz vinyl on my 1200s
sounds better than the same CD.

Go vinyl! Go tube amps! Digital is handy for on the go and personal
collections, but if you are an artist and have a passion for the best form
of audio...stick with analog and dont let computers and technology cheapen

I mean if DaVinci had a PC, would he create the Mona Lisa in Photoshop or

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

Vinyl, while it does have its perks (great transient response, fun sound from all the RIAA curve processing and such), isn't the "best form of audio, period", not by a long shot.  Wide-format analog tape probably still holds that title (with good equipment), with high-sample rate digital perhaps a very close second.

Weirdly enough, especially if you're talking about recently pressed vinyl (IE:stuff pressed since 93 or so), most vinyl pressing plants receive their masters from clients as CDs- regular old, ho-hum-sounding CDs.  When pressed to take another format (even something as banal as 24/96k wav), they balk- many of them never got past 1/4" or 1/2" tape and CDs in terms of source tech.  Some folks did bring in masters on tape, but that's gotten much less common since the mid-90s, and most prosumer tape machines sounded terrible, so only something from a big studio or mastering guy would be an improvement over CD.

So, the format definitely does do something nice to audio, but considering most plants make you digitize/bit reduce/src your masters, all that "great sounding vinyl" we're used to buying these days comes from fairly vanilla source material, so it retains no more "data" than it's fed.  I's a credit to the great vinyl cutting engineers of the world that they can manage to wrangle in a little more vibe through processing and hitting the cutting head hard.

Now those olllld records, sometimes even cut straight to vinyl master (no tape, no digital recording, just plug the mixer into the vinyl cutter and go) are another story- they really do have great fidelity.  No better, so to speak, than wide-format tape or high-res digital, but they certainly have their own flavor, and that inimitable transient response.  They're easy to listen to.

Vinyl's got a couple of funky limitations that definitely keep it from edging near the "best format" crown. Records get worse sounding over the course of the each side- the inner songs always sound worse than the outer because there's just more inches to record to per revolution on the outside than in.  Also, a record's length governs how loudly it can be cut (and thus, how good or bad signal-to-noise and overall quality will be.)  A lot of great, long records sound terrible on vinyl because they had to be cut much quieter.  This is why the 12" single can sound so good- there's a huge amount of real estate available for just a few songs.

..and of course, a little dust on your hard drive won't make your wavs pop, crackle, or skip ;)

Anyway, audio geek hat off! hehe

If you have the patience to weed through the crap, this gives more 
artists a chance for exposure that they wouldn't have had otherwise. 
(And still, most probably shouldn't have that exposure, so the above 
mentioned "curse" is highly valid.)

That's been my experience.  Don't forget the nice waveform on the screen 
to further take away the use of the ear.

That is the real key, one for which I bow down to Mr. AndyW for bringing 
it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

*yawn*

Dinosaur.

I will wreck shop on Serato, and I have seen MANY more than competent DJ's 
using laptop based systems and rock it ten times harder then douchebags with 
decks and vinyl. It's all the skill of the DJ and has next to nothing to do 
with the format.

All this "I like it the old way" crap is exactly that, CRAP.

You like the past so much? Go live in it. Some of us are living in the here 
and now, and the here and now includes digital format and laptop based 
platforms. Build a bridge and get over it.

Ugh.

When JBot, Li and I played at KDVS for a Harmony feature, they were 
suprised that we wanted decks set up.  Mars & Mystere had just played "on 
air" the week before using just one DAT player.

It's not hate to call people on what they are.  F8 had some integrity, 
they threw some good parties early on, they followed a dream, I used to 
stop by their shop regularly when they still carried stuff I might buy 
(their heavy diet of trance and nrg had a nice side effect of getting them 
some unique european techno distributors), but he's no saint and not 
exactly the most technical DJ I've ever seen.  M&M in their prime were 
blowing more calories cheerleading and faking ecstatic responses than 
sweating new orders to play their tracks in.  They were making $1500+ 
playing the same 8-9 records in a set while the average life cycle of a 
raver dropped from a few years to months, partially due to the one 
dimensional diet of the same tunes and same pharmaceutical regimen.

I think Niels said it best when he referred to their music as teutonic 
buck dancing music devoid of any soul.  Or something like that.  Same drum 
builds, no swing, no funk, same hoover and juno crud, all the time.  What 
I can't take away from him is that he was leading the charge on trance and 
nrg in the area... he and a handful of others changed the game for every 
record store owner, party attendee and dj in town whether they liked it or 
not... but was it a good thing?

Not so quick there...


How much fossil fuel is used to power Google so you can find tracks to listen to?

Hint: a fuck of a lot, and even if you don't use Google Beatport has to operate its webservers...


Does your PC that you use to download those tracks contain toxic materials?  What happens to them after I "recycle" it?

Hint: Its probably sent to China...


Downloading is not environmentally neutral either.

FWIW, etc.

Great thing about vinyl is that it is an analog impression with all the richness of the music for what we can and cannot hear. Dont let scientific definitions of what humans can hear define your creative process, that definiation will probably evolve over time.

The party might have been SFR, but those speakers were often mine.  And I 
really didn't mind, just would wear thermals if it was cold, proper 
northern cali style.

As far as the freebie outdoor thing, if it don't go permits, you don't 
charge period.  And I used to do sound for beach renegades free if the 
promoters were responsible and the space was costless/unpermitted.  
Charging for outdoor locations that NONE of us are allowed to be on is 
bullshit.  But lots of people tried it.  Best approach was to take em to a 
free one and let them know about SF's community and the ethic of sharing 
and DIY rather than the ethic of fleecing and bleeding "customers" and 
CYA.  Make your money at the bar, at the warehouse, when it's your ass 
taking the risks and doing the decorating.  And then take that money and 
blow it on free parties that couldn't happen anywhere else in the world 
outside.

And that stuff about records not being free?  If you wouldn't have bought 
the records anyway (without a party paying you back for them), STOP DJING 
NOW.  You pay for them, you own them, what the hell kinda shit is that?  
An outdoor party can be cheaper to throw than going to a club, getting a 
buzz and catching a cab home.  Call up your buddy with the genny, sucker 
some closet scientist into playing first if they bring their decks, tell 
your closest buddies to bring a couple blacklights and whatever goofy 
Amercian DJ shit they have in the closet and it's ON.  Good vibes all 
around, all the people who brought shit take care of everybody else's 
shit, it's the way it was meant to be.

"Baby, you gotta pay to get in my car cause these mad spinnaz didn't pay

And which takes more energy on playback?  2 1200's and a mixer or a 
laptop, controller and a mixer?  Obviously the Serrato solution takes 
more as it's the same but with an extra laptop in the equation.

"Names meant more, labels meant more, and nobody was putting out crap only a
mother could love."

Imma have to call bullshit on that. I've waded through just as much complete
crap looking for vinyl to buy as I have looking for mp3's.

Also, as far as rocking out with a serato/laptop setup. . . It's called
turning the laptop away from you while you play. Pretty much means using it
only to switch tracks, which makes the mixing a bit more difficult since
there's no reference for phrasing. Finally, in my experience, Serato will
skip a LOT less than vinyl will.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: new downtempo mix at 6th Floor Sessions

Another two weeks, another podcast.  i'm proud to present kitchen sync
- and awesome downtempo mix from a good friend of mine - hawker. his
description of the tasty audio treat you're about to consume:

"A genre bending down tempo romp composed with Albelton Live, 'Go
Ahead, Kitchen Sync' was created to showcase several styles of
downtempo grooves, maintaining a chunky, breaky beat throughout. My
first mix in a few years, I spent some time playing with quick mixes
in vocal heavy tracks, as well as building a progression of mood
through the mix."

You can grab it at
http://zombie-j.com

or subscribe to the podcast on itunes.
http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=266250961

6th Floor Session is a biweekly-ish podcast with mixes and tracks fro
zombie-j and his peeps.  Style is usually dubstep / breaks /
downtempo, but if its good, i'll post it.  The music is always new and
always exclusive.

Ah, vinyl hunting.  I love the fact that checking out the groove on a 
slab-o-vinyl can tell you a lot about the composition of a track.  Use 
this the next time you're in a store without a listening station.

But, back on topic.  I think the issue is the cost barrier difference 
between the two.  It definitely COSTS more to release a track on vinyl. 
Thus the LOVE and DEVOTION toward that track that someone releasing it 
must have (as Andy stated.)

I'll buy that.  How often do folks do this though?  Can't say I've seen 
a one. :)  Sounds like you need to get out here to SF Pinkko and show SF 
how it's done!

The reference for phrasing is what you hear, no?  Sure, you can't SEE 
the beginning of a breakdown coming up, or a major sound change coming 
up, but...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

You also have to look at incremental costs because some vinyl already exists.  

Is it better for the environment to go to Ameoba (by bicycle of course) and buy the existing record, or download the track from those gas guzzling, heat wasting, toxic web servers?

I'm not biased and this is an entirely reasonable argument. :P

Still takes fossil fuel - but how much fossil fuel does it take to make the 
vinyl, cut it, and ship it?

I'd be interested to know what it costs in fossil fuels to put out one slab 
o' wax and one digital track. I am guessing vinyl still sucks up more 
resources (when you factor in the freight and whatnot), but who knows.

Subject: [sfraves] Work it out, DJs!  Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

That's why I always power my laptop/Torq system with a specially rigged exercise bike while in the booth.  It serves many purposes.  

* Keeps me looking like I'm digging ditches up there so people know I'm working hard to make them dance

* Allows all of my sweet music to reach the house system totally carbon neutral- it's pedal power, baby!
* Keeps my heart rate up so I get a good hour of cardio in, and preemptively burn off the half-bottle of Fernet I'll be ingesting later
* Justifies my towering collection of 80s neon sweatbands

Get your spin up, Douche Jockeys!  ...and save the Earth!

Sure you have guy. You saw me play a dnb set this way at Adrianapalooza.

Also, I made it back to SF shortly after the new year and I'll be happy to
play dnb/dubstep/anthem trance for anyone that'll have me.

"You don't need that many damn visual references to mix. The vast majority
of
tracks out nowadays...and this goes back for a number of years, ALL have mix
points roughly at a minute to a minute and a half in - sometimes two, and
the same on the way out. Almost all tracks have VERY STANDARD mix points.
Records, digital, whatever, the vast majority of tunes out there have these
mix points."

Sure, but most vinyl djs (that I've seen, anyway) use the grooves on the
vinyl as a reference. The lighter areas are breaks and so on. Every dj worth
his salt knows how to read the grooves, you get used to it, and when that's
not there anymore you find yourself guessing at times. Hence mixing without
any visual reference whatsoever is (slightly) more difficult.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

but that's because you're a broke dj.  Mega-Dj's can afford to play a 
record once.

A never before played record has better sound than a straight digital 
recording, if the sound was recorded in analog and pressed without 
conversion.

That said, I have tons of mp3's, and no records.  The small 
difference in richness isn't compelling to me.. but I do think the 
difference is there.

the amount of pollution created by making blanks and pressing records 
pales in comparison to the pollution created by the application of 
rare earth minerals inside cell phones, ipods, laptops, etc.

So while on topic, I want to pose a question to ya'll. Would you guy
honestly go out and shell out money to see a dj who was playing a non- live

that lose any entertainment value for you? Curious.

Personally I only mix cylinder recordings using my hand cranked phonograph: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:EdisonPhonograph.jpg 

The gramophone is only for lazy no talent DJs!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

It depends on whether Tiesto autographed the laptop I guess... LOL.

Anyhow...

Once upon a time it was about the party, not the DJ or the music delivery format...

So I ask you in addition:

How about going to a party where the DJ booth is hidden from view and the DJ is never seen by the crowd?

How about going to a party where the DJs' names are not released?

How about goingot a party where the focus was on the celebration and the people doing the celebrating?  

Of course one of them might also happen to be the DJ. ;)

Best,

Peter

So while on topic, I want to pose a question to ya'll. Would you guy
honestly go out and shell out money to see a dj who was playing a non- live
PA set merely on his laptop? Just standing there clicking a mouse. Would
that lose any entertainment value for you? Curious.

That would bother me actually. I mean I understand the reason for it, but I
LOVE watching the DJ do his magic so to speak. It's part of the experience
for me and I like the DJ seeing me react to their music if I'm dancing my
ass off :P It's encouragement. I actually have been to a party like that,
but it was okay cuz the DJ was actually obscurred by a wall of speakes so
that compensated for it.

How about going to a party where the DJs' names are not released?


Like beforehand or what? Never released? Not released just beforehand would
be cool because it would be a suprise. Never released would be interesting.
Mystery DJs lol.

How about goingot a party where the focus was on the celebration and the
> people doing the celebrating?


I could dig that.

Of course one of them might also happen to be the DJ. ;)


Even better. Hehe. It would be interesting to throw a party with all these
characteristics you just named. Nice to make people "party outside of the
box" so to speak :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

Well,

I was really uncomfortable using Live at first. It seems like  
cheating, but once I figured out what it could do, no problems  
anymore. I still love vinyl, but I honestly don't have time to convert  
all my tunes. Live is weird, its more like live studio work than  
DJing. If you are just using a laptop, for sure it loses entertainment  
value. If you spend time setting it up so that you don't even have to  
touch the laptop, maybe not so much. I would have to say, though, that  
doing a good set on a laptop is not trivial. If you are doing it  
properly, putting the time into being an entertainer, and learning the  
craft (whether on decks or a laptop) means a lot more than format. IMHO.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

Of course I agree with all of these points.  

I've been to a few parties where I never even saw the DJ and had a great time.  But the DJ audience connection is important too.

At WMC 2000 and 2001 I went to so many parties with DJs I had never even heard of before.  Eye opening sometimes, shitty sometimes, but not usually boring.  I'm willing to take some chances if I know the people throwing the party or the venue or some people going or ...

Finally, how about going to a party where the DJ plays a Nintendo DS?

Check it: http://sanfrancisco.going.com/micromusicsf_launch

This Thursday night!

Best,

Peter

That would bother me actually. I mean I understand the reason for it, but I
LOVE watching the DJ do his magic so to speak. It's part of the experience
for me and I like the DJ seeing me react to their music if I'm dancing my
ass off :P It's encouragement. I actually have been to a party like that,
but it was okay cuz the DJ was actually obscurred by a wall of speakes so
that compensated for it.

How about going to a party where the DJs' names are not released?


Like beforehand or what? Never released? Not released just beforehand would
be cool because it would be a suprise. Never released would be interesting.
Mystery DJs lol.

How about goingot a party where the focus was on the celebration and the
> people doing the celebrating?


I could dig that.

Of course one of them might also happen to be the DJ. ;)


Even better. Hehe. It would be interesting to throw a party with all these
characteristics you just named. Nice to make people "party outside of the
box" so to speak :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

Well,

I was really uncomfortable using Live at first. It seems like  
cheating, but once I figured out what it could do, no problems  
anymore. I still love vinyl, but I honestly don't have time to convert  
all my tunes. Live is weird, its more like live studio work than  
DJing. If you are just using a laptop, for sure it loses entertainment  
value. If you spend time setting it up so that you don't even have to  
touch the laptop, maybe not so much. I would have to say, though, that  
doing a good set on a laptop is not trivial. If you are doing it  
properly, putting the time into being an entertainer, and learning the  
craft (whether on decks or a laptop) means a lot more than format. IMHO.

That actually sounds really cool! You know I think crews should look to new
eye opening party experiences to give their guests more often.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

That sounds like the clubs in the 80s. I never knew who the DJ was, but I 
DID care about good music (although I didn't care about the particular 
format in which it was delivered).
In current times where "everyone's a DJ" and that equates to so many being 
shitty, I say, hell yeah, at playing at a party where the lineup is never 
released.
BUT, when it comes to putting all DJs outta view, I'm not sure what the 
purpose of having a DJ would be in that case...a real DJ anyway.  I mean, 
put an IPod in the corner and be done with it for christ's sake and see how 
much vibe it can create.  The point is, that even in today's jaded 
electronic subctulture, there remain DJs who actualy treat the whole thing 
as an artform and are recognized for just that.  Not everyone is a human 
jukebox... some DJs are ARTISTs and not only rely on their ability to 
program to a particular crowd, but also utilize the TOOLs of the trade to 
bring the whole experience to another level.  People don't need to see that, 
they can feel it!

Would you want to pay to see a band behind a curtain?  (Some DJs actually 
play with instrument accompaniment such as drummers etc).

There are shitty bands just like shitty DJs.  The best bands tend to attract 
the best crowds and the most respect.  The best DJs tend to attract the best 
crowds and the most respect.

oh now i've gone on a tangent...

but anyhow...

PLUR!

LOL

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

No offense I hope dragnfly because really I am just asking these somewhat off the wall questions to see where the boundaries are.  I think many parties have become formulaic, inside the box, and I'm wondering about alternative ideas.  But what is ok for some people is too far for others.  I'm all for the dancer DJ conneciton BTW, but I'm less fond of the whole "stand around and watch the DJ mix" scene.  So DJ dancer connection yes, DJ as focus of attention and no dancing, no.  

I'm glad you like the idea of a "surprise" party though!  Probably the most realistic way is to have the DJs names secret until the party.  Keeping them secret even afterwards is interesting too though!  Anyway I hope somebody does some version of this idea  HINT HINT!

People that are vinyl purists are missing the boat IMO, use whatever technology works is my creed, and that is my point.  Using a laptop doesn't have to make the DJ disappear (i.e. become meaningless, just a human iPod as you put it) However it might. How can you tell if someone is playing live vs. a recording for example?  Some well known DJs have been accused of playing recordings from DAT; the DJ equivalent of lip synching.  With laptops, how would you ever know unless you monitored their screen or watched what they typed?

Today DJs are moving to laptops and hybrid systems, but what's next might be a lot like an iPod actually.  And if this comes to pass I predict that many of tomorrows laptop DJs will argue that there's no skill involved in playing on these devices.  They'll be "laptop purists"...

That sounds like the clubs in the 80s. I never knew who the DJ was, but I 
DID care about good music (although I didn't care about the particular 
format in which it was delivered).
In current times where "everyone's a DJ" and that equates to so many being 
shitty, I say, hell yeah, at playing at a party where the lineup is never 
released.
BUT, when it comes to putting all DJs outta view, I'm not sure what the 
purpose of having a DJ would be in that case...a real DJ anyway.  I mean, 
put an IPod in the corner and be done with it for christ's sake and see how 
much vibe it can create.  The point is, that even in today's jaded 
electronic subctulture, there remain DJs who actualy treat the whole thing 
as an artform and are recognized for just that.  Not everyone is a human 
jukebox... some DJs are ARTISTs and not only rely on their ability to 
program to a particular crowd, but also utilize the TOOLs of the trade to 
bring the whole experience to another level.  People don't need to see that, 
they can feel it!

Would you want to pay to see a band behind a curtain?  (Some DJs actually 
play with instrument accompaniment such as drummers etc).

There are shitty bands just like shitty DJs.  The best bands tend to attract 
the best crowds and the most respect.  The best DJs tend to attract the best 
crowds and the most respect.

oh now i've gone on a tangent...

but anyhow...

PLUR!

LOL

I see it happen all the time- mainly hipster scene djs. Auto-beatmatching, not much in the way of mix tricks (of course).  No controller, maybe an audio interface if you're lucky.

Weirdly, it doesn't seem to faze any of the dancers at those parties- they love the music and dance their asses off..  

Would bore the piss out of me were I up there doing that- which is why I'm always playing with some precarious pile of controllers, to keep things fun and fluid (and fun to watch).

Myself and my 'partner' have recently included gwar style bukakke into
all our dj performances to make it clear how big our dj cocks are (we're
not compensating, no, really).

Since people are starting to get board (read: wood) with this already (fuck
people are hard to please these days), we think we've figured out how to
incorporate 2djsonecup.

Andrew is so excited about this prospect that he secretly booked us for
Midnight Blue.

Shh!!! Don't tell anyone! It's just between you and me, sfraves.

Subject: [sfraves] records with loops

I just picked up this Serbian techno record by Marco Nastic and it has two loop tracks (creatively entitled loop 1 and loop 2) in addiiton to the regular old techno tracks on the record.  I was messing with these a bit last night and had a lot of fun mixing with these loop tracks.  Can anyone out there suggest some additional records with cool little loops like this?  I'm looking for actual vinyl records with loops, not just a colleciton of digital loops.  K, thnx.

Best,

Peter

PS I almost feel like a laptop DJ when I mix with these loops...w00t!  ;)

What if you bike to your girlfriend's house (in NOPA) and wakl to Ameoba
from there (and use the visual cues in the vinyl as an additional data
point in making your selections?)

Now we know the REAL reason!! :)

But you can probably post them to Craigslist (cross posting to here and
Bayraves) and make a mint.

How many panhandlers do you pass on the way?  And what do you give them?

I feel like this might turn into an algebra problem...

PS This time of year I like to carry a few oranges or tangerines to give out to people that ask for money and most people seem pretty happy to get them.

What if you bike to your girlfriend's house (in NOPA) and wakl to Ameoba
from there (and use the visual cues in the vinyl as an additional data
point in making your selections?)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] records with loops

Woot!  Loops are fun.

If you see an NSC logo etched in the runout groove at the center of the 
record you might find a locked groove on it.  Legend has it that Ron 
Murphy, the man behind NSC, was who invented this concept in the dance 
music realm (on The Rings Of Saturn from Jeff Mills.)

He just passed away in January.

  Does anybody have some good happy hardcore mixes (and yes I realize
 that some of you may cite this as an oxymoron)? I'm looking for the
 classics from like... 98-2002ish.

And again, yes, I am serious. Fer reals. Like... really, though.

(So glad Bam's gone so he can't use this as ammo.)

Heart,

Look for anything entitled "DJ tools" on record sites. They are almost all =
loop records or sample records.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] records with loops

i've got a ton of records with infinite loops at the end.  i'll
dig around and find them for you:  most are techno.  one famous
one is josh wink's "don't laugh".

i also have one that plays with the groove in reverse (from the
center of the record --> the outside of the record).  this is a
fun one to leave for the next DJ if you don't like him/her.

i think i also have one that plays one groove in the correct
direction and right alongside it is another groove that plays
in reverse.  that's a real mind-twister for sure.

fyi, most (if not all) of my "DJ tools" records aren't infinite
loops, but are finite-timed tracks that are boring and
repetitive.  good for a transition, but i've found that i
haven't used them too often.

the future is now! -- check out the Cortex Dmix-300:

http://www.cortex-pro.com/dmix_300.php

and the Dmix-600:

http://www.cortex-pro.com/dmix_600.php


I had the opportunity to play with the 600 at a trade
show recently (as I always carry around my iPod which
is filled with old R&B "rare groove" break sources)
and I was really amazed by it.  I was even able to
load the same song into the two "decks" and set
discrete cue points and beat-juggle and whatnot. 
Busting out the Peter Piper routine has never been
easier!  :D

DJ Swamp has a series of locked-groove records called
"Neverending Breakbeats"

The Speedy J album "Loudboxer" is a perennial favorite
made up of two records with 50 locked grooves per
side.  

You can usually find locked groove collections in the
Tools/Scratch/Battle section of your favorite rekkid
shop

Or just do a google or ebay search for "locked groove"
and you'll find stuff.

An interesting discussion of locked groove rekkids can
be found here:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] records with loops

i <3 loop records!! i have a bunch of these. as uncle noah mentioned 
speedy j's loudboxer has a
ton of loops on the vinyl album set. he was really cool by letting
people access his loops and asking people to submit the tracks they made
with them to him via e-mail. molecular put out a record entirely of
loops as well as ars larson, frankie bones and jim hopkins did some dj
tools in the early incarnations of their careers, bones with bonesbreaks
and hopkins with the early twitch releases. if you listen to bonesbreaks
11 you can distinctly hear where the electroliners 'loose caboose' came
from. also vestax put out a record entirely made of synthesizer tones..
wicked fun.
     loops records are especially fun if: you know what you want to do
with them (a set plan really helps), have more than one copy and you
have 4 turntables plus FX. for example, you can make a 4 track mix based
entirely off of loops. get 4 of the same loop record, keep it on quartz
lock... set up the ambient bit and the hard beat mix, the breakdown, the
second half of the hard main beat, or a loop with a good head note to
tell you where the start of the loop is by ear and voila, oontz oontz
oontz. -count it by 2 and you have a solid beat if you change it up the
second bar..

    it helps to have 2 djs doing it too with 2 mixers because it can get
pretty hectic. also changing the tracks in time is problematic.. the key
is to do as much as you can with the limited amount of time and to
change shit up every bar/other bar and keep in time as much as possible
with counting. if you have a pair of cd players in coordination with
this set up plus a PV grabber/floor sampler it can be really awesome.

i think loop records would save vinyl if more people put them out but
they are quite possibly a fun novelty especially when cd players,
ableton and traktor can do this without batting an eyelash. but seeing
djs sweat and trying to keep things on beat is really fun and exciting
to watch. so if its fun, i'd probably go with that.

peace love and techno!
sean.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] records with loops

i <3 loop records!! i have a bunch of these. as uncle noah mentioned 
speedy j's loudboxer has a
ton of loops on the vinyl album set. he was really cool by letting
people access his loops and asking people to submit the tracks they made
with them to him via e-mail. molecular put out a record entirely of
loops as well as ars larson, frankie bones and jim hopkins did some dj
tools in the early incarnations of their careers, bones with bonesbreaks
and hopkins with the early twitch releases. if you listen to bonesbreaks
11 you can distinctly hear where the electroliners 'loose caboose' came
from. also vestax put out a record entirely made of synthesizer tones..
wicked fun.
    loops records are especially fun if: you know what you want to do
with them (a set plan really helps), have more than one copy and you
have 4 turntables plus FX. for example, you can make a 4 track mix based
entirely off of loops. get 4 of the same loop record, keep it on quartz
lock... set up the ambient bit and the hard beat mix, the breakdown, the
second half of the hard main beat, or a loop with a good head note to
tell you where the start of the loop is by ear and voila, oontz oontz
oontz. -count it by 2 and you have a solid beat if you change it up the
second bar..

    it helps to have 2 djs doing it too with 2 mixers because it can get
pretty hectic. also changing the tracks in time is problematic.. the key
is to do as much as you can with the limited amount of time and to
change shit up every bar/other bar and keep in time as much as possible
with counting. if you have a pair of cd players in coordination with
this set up plus a PV grabber/floor sampler it can be really awesome.

i think loop records would save vinyl if more people put them out but
they are quite possibly a fun novelty especially when cd players,
ableton and traktor can do this without batting an eyelash. but seeing
djs sweat and trying to keep things on beat is really fun and exciting
to watch. so if its fun, i'd probably go with that.

peace love and techno!
sean.

i've got a ton of records with infinite loops at the end.  i'll
dig around and find them for you:  most are techno.  one famous
one is josh wink's "don't laugh".

i also have one that plays with the groove in reverse (from the
center of the record --> the outside of the record).  this is a
fun one to leave for the next DJ if you don't like him/her.

i think i also have one that plays one groove in the correct
direction and right alongside it is another groove that plays
in reverse.  that's a real mind-twister for sure.

fyi, most (if not all) of my "DJ tools" records aren't infinite
loops, but are finite-timed tracks that are boring and
repetitive.  good for a transition, but i've found that i
haven't used them too often.

DJ Swamp has a series of locked-groove records called
"Neverending Breakbeats"

The Speedy J album "Loudboxer" is a perennial favorite
made up of two records with 50 locked grooves per
side.  

You can usually find locked groove collections in the
Tools/Scratch/Battle section of your favorite rekkid
shop

Or just do a google or ebay search for "locked groove"
and you'll find stuff.

An interesting discussion of locked groove rekkids can
be found here:

I wasn't sure either.  It was on a Seinfield show, I wonder if that's the origin.

I have a feeling this means paying for people who can't afford to go. :)

Yes, it was on Seinfeld.  George saw all these people donating to charity,
so he created something called the Human Fund.  Except, that the Human fund
was really his own personal bank account.  Now, who cares to donate to the
Human Fund???

Seinfeld episode 166, production code 910 "The Strike"

http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=910

http://www.tv.com/seinfeld/the-strike/episode/2406/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;9

This is also the episode that tells us about Festivus.

Possibly the greatest and most impactful episode of
Seinfeld ever.  We celebrate Festivus at my office
each year.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] records with loops

The new STL (Stephen Laubner) series of singles on Something records has 
a side with a bunch of short minimal house loops. One of the 12"s has 
some rain and weather sounds that are fun for mixing too. Not sure where 
you would find them other than http://hardwax.com/55252/

Hey all,=20

My head of finance at my office is looking for a DJ for an event she's =
planning on March 1st - something along the lines of a wedding DJ, but =
this is not a wedding, it's a crab feast. The crowd is aged around late =
30's to late 40's - at the Foster City Rec center. They are looking for =
like, typical radio hits - less rock, more dance and funk type stuff.

Anyone interested, hit me up!!!

Also - another co-worker is planning an event at (I think) Club Suede - =
and they need a hip-hop DJ - strictly hip-hop and that sorta =
thing....holla back for more details!



~ Marco

Subject: [sfraves] .::BSP coming this friday on Radio integrated 2.8.8::.

This coming friday, its Durrtay Techno Night featuring the filthy hard 
acid techno stylings of:

DJ STML aka Sean's Techno Music Library DEF(defsf.com)

Sean (not me) hails originally from South Africa and originally started 
out as a punk rock musician who got turned on to acid house early on 
with Sheep on Drugs and Hip House. STML has had a long career in the DJ 
scene from Capetown to London as a DJ and collaborator in the acid 
techno scene there.  Currently STML is a key member of DEF and with him 
on board we expect to see great things come about in the coming versions 
of the defsf.com site. word.

and the mentalist hard techno pounding of Andy W aka Mutor Soundsystem, 
Dobox records, Resource records

Andy W has been there and back and held up his end of the techno scene 
for more than a decade. Known for his sets at the Cloudfactory parties, 
FnF parties, Harmony parties, DEF parties and, dare i say it, even 
Skills parties when they were playing techno, Andy has been one of the 
bastions of techno in the bay area and kept it real. This friday we're 
looking forward to a Dj set by one of the people that continues to 
remain synonymous with techno in the bay area, Andy W! (applause)


Tune in at http://www.zer01.net:1200/
Every Friday from 9pm - 1AM PST

Contact : radiointegrated@gmail.com

next week 2.15.:
its fukinn awesome techno night with the sounds of DJ Alex Windsor & Dj 
Perla!

If anybody's ever seen Alex in action at FnF parties you know what a 
great talent he has for the wheels of steel and a great sense of flow 
and mastery he has for them. DJ Perla has appeared on Radio integrated 
before and totally has rocked it with his own live material.. we are 
pleased to welcome Perla back this time for a special dj set of his pick 
of tracks that have been influencing him and shaping his current sound 
to date.  more info coming soon... `;)

I'm a lurker hoping to meet some new people to chill with at BM. We''re
going to have a private camp. Like 6 of us. ANd want to find some other
folks to meet up with to go dancing and trippin around at night. I'm quite
sure we'll meet more people than we can remember just going, but we are
really hoping to nerd out and play GPS hide and seek. Anyone ever do any GPS
seek-and-find trips?
Anyways, I'm Chris, or Spence if you get to know me.

EZ,

Spence

This country has been about a lot of things, but freedom was never one of

True that:

more.

I know I've seen more (coming FROM the UN) on the topic, but don't have 
access to those bookmarks right now.

I'd have to disagree with you in part, the country was founded on the  
principles of freedom and liberty, but has over and over been  
hijacked by those who hate it and seek to destroy all freedom and  
liberty.  That doesn't mean we just give up and let them win.

Well, for everyone but the slaves.

Read some history guy. You cannot say that a country where only white people
were free was founded on the principles of freedom and liberty.

Well, I mean, you can say that, but you'd be wrong.

Slavery is mentioned (implied, really) twice in the Constitution, one  
was modified by the 14th amendment and the other had a time limit set  
on it to the year 1808, letting someone in the future to argue over  
it.  So really, for all intents and purposes, implied once.

What does that have to do with the Bill of Rights and the rest of the  
Constitution, which was clearly written with many levels of checks  
and balances and the Tenth amendment, which clearly states that all  
powers not enumerated to the government reside in the people?

It has to do with who 'the people' are. Guaranteeing freedom to white people
and allowing everyone else to be murdered/enslaved/raped/whatever, isn't
really basing anything in the country on freedom and liberty so much as
paying lip service to the ideas so that people like you will buy into that
'America is the greatest country in the world' bullshit. Let me give you
some advice. America is no more the greatest country in the world than my
cock is the biggest cock in the world. Divorce yourself from that idea, and
it's pretty plain to see that freedom and liberty have no more meaning here
than they do anywhere else.

You can believe whatever you want, but the fact of the matter is that the US
as a nation was built on the backs of oppressed peoples everywhere. At best
you could say that this country was founded on the ideas of freedom and
liberty for white people. But that's not really saying a whole lot, is it?
Was the Roman Republic a free nation? Sure. If you weren't a plebiscite, or
a slave, it was free as hell. It's the same thing here. If you're not poor
and brown, sure, America is a free ass country. Otherwise, not so much.

Do you really think American slavery ended with the Emancipation
Proclamation? It didn't, it was just made less obvious. Don't even get me
started on the genocide of the Indigenous Peoples that allowed for enough
white people even to be here to start a country in the first place.

The US is a decent place to live (well, some parts, anyway), but don't go
around acting like (or thinking) that it's special, or different from any
other country in the world. It's not, it was founded by flawed people with
flawed ideas and continues to be run by flawed people with flawed ideas.
Just like every other fucking place on earth.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

You manage to read the worst into anything I say, which is fine...cuz people 
with no lives tend to do that sort of thing.

Drama queen much? Nice try though kid.

PLEASE try copping this 'tude to my face some day homie. Somehow I doubt you 
have the stones to bring this sort of BS in person cuz you know your 
bitch-ass would get handed the beatdown faster than Osby can say "Hello 
Today" 3 times fast.

FWIW, I already knew about these devices...I was talking about doing a performance from a unit the size of an iPod not plugging the iPod into something that lets you mix.  But these actually already exist too.   I'm on the waiting list for one of them, the Pacemaker, so I wrote that somewhat tongue in cheek.  I'm not sure I'm going to actually order one however, but here's the scoop in case you or anyone else hasn't seen this little gadget:

Here's one:
http://sanfrancisco.tribe.net/event/a0aca3f5-bb64-493f-9dd1-0d026ec2566c

Date & Time: 2008-02-09 9:00 PM
Location: The Connecticut Yankee


We're baa-ack! Hair of the Dog, the most rockingest bar on the playa,
takes over the Connecticut Yankee in SF for another evening of dancing
and merry-making on Saturday, Feb. 9.

The evening will feature live music from HOTD house bands (FWIW: I'm in 
both Curly and the Reverberators):

Gomer Hendrix
The Reverberators
Curly
And the first live performance of Larry: The Musical

Performances start around 10pm. Come out early if you want a good 
dinner. The Yankee serves up some great grub.

Come on out and support local live music and the camp that has been 
bringing live music to the playa since 2000!

We hope to see you there

I'm on the waiting list also.  It looks really sweet and I can't wait to see how it performs.  If it performs as expected I will be totally stoked.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

I found this quote last night sifting through news links.  This  
touches on a whole range of opinions that are not discussed in the  
government training camps (schools and universities).

--

Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation is a dubious document that has  
been widely touted as having "freed the slaves." It didn't. It was  
aimed at the slaves in Confederate territory where Lincoln had no  
legal authority. Slaves in both states and territory controlled by Mr.  
Lincoln's dictatorial regime remained firmly in bondage until the 13th  
Amendment freed them, several months after Mr. Lincoln's demise. Even  
Lincoln, himself, admitted the proclamation was a war measure and  
probably would not have passed any sort of constitutional muster. So  
who did it really free? No one, that's who. It was never intended to  
"free" anyone. It was excellent propaganda and that was it. Period!

- Al Benson, Jr.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Derrick May is still a vinyl purist

On a related note, does anyone know of a device that is both a CD DJ controller AND a laptop DJ interface?  I'm not talking about playing both red book music CDs and MP3 CDs, but rather a CD DJ unit that can also be used as a control interface for MP3 mixing.  Does this exist?

Best,

Peter

I'm on the waiting list also.  It looks really sweet and I can't wait to see how it performs.  If it performs as expected I will be totally stoked.

But these actually already exist too.  I'm on the waiting list for one of them, the Pacemaker, so I wrote that somewhat tongue in cheek.  I'm not sure I'm going to actually order one however, but here's the scoop in case you or anyone else hasn't seen this little gadget:

YES YES I DO!!! :-P
CDJ-400 =
http://www.djbooth.net/index/dj-equipment/review/pioneer-cdj-400/
NOt sure about which softwares etc...
But sounds very cool....
Please share opinions if anyone gave it a spin or has
some more info...
Thanks,

--------------------------------------
On a related note, does anyone know of a device that
is both a CD DJ
 controller AND a laptop DJ interface?  I'm not
talking about playing both
 red book music CDs and MP3 CDs, but rather a CD DJ
unit that can also
 be used as a control interface for MP3 mixing.  Does
this exist?

Best,

Peter

Are you guys partying at a new underground location?  Your other back alley
spot is cool, but a little cramped for my tastes-    Hopefully much
larger???

it's not one of our typical spots cuz we're not hosting the party.... we
(kontrol) are guests of Roundmusic.

i'm not supposed to disclose the location, but i can say:

- yes, much larger than 58 tehama....its BIG.
- its a commonly used UG spot, but we've never played there b4
- its two stories
- its not right downtown.

do the math!  :P

hope to see some of you out tomorrow.

of course he is a jaded hippy - and one of my all-time heroes -

the concert referenced in the film came to Concord 2 summers ago - it 
was 110 degrees when
they took the stage at 7:30 - they played for almost 4 hours with 
only one 20 minute break -
amazing amazing amazing - not bad for a bunch of old jaded hippies

Neil needs to go to a rave.

I don't know if one song can end a war, and I'm not sure where that idea ever came from, but that does not equate to music having no effect in the world. 

I think he's getting old (we all do) and tired.  And maybe also a bit discouraged.  I think he's looking mainly at rock and roll culture which has clearly been overtaken by corporations and is ruled by greed heads that will turn even the most purely political song into a sell out if they see a way to make a buck.  See the endless stream of BlankAid concerts that are really more about business as usual (seeling records, promoting bands) than they are about aiding anyone.

I think it is quite hard to observe and measure progress when things change slowly.  And it is discouraging sometimes to realize just how slowly things change.

But that doesn't mean that progress isn't happening, or that things can't get better, or that music has no effect on politics.

Best,

Peter

Historical perspective/context -

After the murder of 4 students at Kent State University by the National Guard
at the height of the Vietnam War - Neil wrote a song called "Ohio" - 
which was recorded
and released within DAYS of the murders - it was an instant # 1 
across the board hit -
some of the chorus of the song has the lyrics "We can change the 
world - rearrange the world"
which is what I am sure he was referring to in his comments - music 
has not had the kind
of impact that single did - in a very very long time.

techno scene there.  Currently STML is a key member of DEF and with him 
on board we expect to see great things come about in the coming versions 
of the defsf.com site. word.

and the mentalist hard techno pounding of Andy W aka Mutor Soundsystem, 
Dobox records, Resource records

Andy W has been there and back and held up his end of the techno scene 
for more than a decade. Known for his sets at the Cloudfactory parties, 
FnF parties, Harmony parties, DEF parties and, dare i say it, even 
Skills parties when they were playing techno, Andy has been one of the 
bastions of techno in the bay area and kept it real. This friday we're 
looking forward to a Dj set by one of the people that continues to 
remain synonymous with techno in the bay area, Andy W! (applause)

Last minute Add! Thomas B Basswaves, FnF will be  dropping by with his 
newest original material, you heard it here first.

DJ Alex Windsor

has for the wheels of steel and a great sense of flow and mastery he has 
for them. Originally from London, UK, Alex has been instrumental in the 
San Francisco Techno (with a capital T) scene here since 1992 as a 
partner in the Gaia Mantra Record store in SF and as a promoter and 
resident of MAD mondays.. for those of you who don't know, MAD used to 
be where it was at for Techno in SF from 95-97 Giving voice to the early 
SF minimal techno scene and showcasing techno that would probably had 
been not heard anywhere else in the city at the time. Alex's skills have 
taken him all across the globe, from the US to Japan, and the UK. He has 
played alongside the likes of Aphex Twin, the Shamen, Orbital, Carl 
Craig, Richie hawtin, Moby, Mr.C, Juan Atkins, Mark Broom, & Dave Clarke 
to name a few.... He's Dj'd at parties here in SF by crews with such 
infamously dope names names as FnF, Harmony, Area 51, Tribal Future, 
Gateway, Brass Tax , Future &  more undergrounds than my short term 
memory loss can muster.
Dj Perla
    Perla has appeared on Radio Integrated before and totally has rocked 
it with his own live material.. Perla originally hails from southern 
spain where he helped promote his Dance Usted parties or, 'Dance Please' 
As bulletproof and flawless as his original tracks are, his selection 
skills are equally unbeatable. we are pleased to welcome Perla back this 
time for a special dj set of his pick of tracks that have been 
influencing him and shaping his current sound to date.  ... `;)

I know the song...

I was alive then actually tho I was a little kid.  

There were many factors that led to the end of the Vietnam War, and the conflict with the counter culture, and youth culture more generally, at home as exemplified in *Ohio* was only one of them.  And the Song *Ohio* was only one of many anti-war, anti-establishment, and anti-government songs of that era.  True *Ohio* came out just days after the shootings at Kent State, an event which turned many who were previously on the fence against the government at the time.  I am sure that many felt that *Ohio* perfectly captured the emotion and zetgeist of that moment.  However to attribute this to the song rather than the events is revisionist at best.  Certainly the song didn't end the Vietnam War single handedly by any reasonable assessment.  So I don't get the surprise or dismay that there isn't such a "war ending song" today.  

Best,

Peter

Tonight on Radio Integrated::: Friday, February 8th, 2008:::...

DJ STML aka Sean's Techno Music Library DEF(defsf.com)

Sean STML hails from South Africa and originally started
out as a punk rock musician who got turned on to acid house early on
with Sheep on Drugs and Hip House. STML has had a long career in the DJ
scene from Capetown to London as a DJ and collaborator in the acid
techno scene.  Currently STML is a key member of DEF and with him
on board we expect to see great things come about in the coming versions
of the defsf.com site. word.


Andy W has been there and back and held up his end of the techno scene
for more than a decade. Known for his sets at the Cloudfactory parties,
FnF parties, Harmony parties, DEF parties and, dare I say it, even
Skills parties when they were playing techno, Andy has been one of the
bastions of techno in the bay area and kept it real. This friday we're
looking forward to a DJ set by one of the people that continues to
remain synonymous with techno in the bay area, Andy W! (applause)

*Last minute Add! Thomas B (Basswaves, FnF) will be  dropping by with a live
set of his
newest original material, you heard it here first.

next week 2.15.:
its fukinn awesome techno night with the sounds of

DJ Alex Windsor

If anybody's ever seen Alex in action you know what a talent he
has for the wheels of steel and a great sense of flow and mastery he has
for them. Originally from London, UK, Alex has been instrumental in the
San Francisco Techno (with a capital T) scene here since 1992 as a
partner in the Gaia Mantra Record store in SF and as a promoter and
resident of MAD mondays.. for those of you who don't know, MAD used to
be where it was at for Techno in SF from 95-97 Giving voice to the early
SF minimal techno scene and showcasing techno that would probably had
been not heard anywhere else in the city at the time. Alex's skills have
taken him all across the globe, from the US to Japan, and the UK. He has
played alongside the likes of Aphex Twin, the Shamen, Orbital, Carl
Craig, Richie Hawtin, Moby, Mr.C, Juan Atkins, Mark Broom, & Dave Clarke
to name a few.... He's DJed at parties here in SF by crews with such
infamously dope names names as FnF, Harmony, Area 51, Tribal Future,
Gateway, Brass Tax , Future &  more undergrounds than my short term
memory loss can muster.

DJ Perla

   Perla has appeared on Radio Integrated before and totally has rocked
it with his own live material.. Perla originally hails from Southern
Spain where he helped promote his Dance Usted parties or, 'Dance Please.'
As bulletproof and flawless as his original tracks are, his selection
skills are equally unbeatable. We are pleased to welcome Perla back this
time for a special DJset of his pick of tracks that have been
influencing him and shaping his current sound to date.  ... `;)

When my GF's childhood gymnastic tutors in Portola Valley retired to 
move to Hawaii, Neil, being a plugged in local, showed up for the 
ceremony. I made a point of not interacting in the parking lot after, 
but I did note that he tools around in Woodside in a pretty funky circa 
1970s Woody station wagon. And maybe music can't stop wars, but judging 
by what I saw at the annual Bridge School Concerts at Shoreline, it can 
be a positive force for good, so I'm thinking Neil said all that because 
he's getting older and crankier.

His "Freedom" album, (which you may be most familiar with from Michael 
Moore's Fahrenheit 9/!! credit roll), along with Big Audio Dynamite, (my 
musical introduction to that thing called 'teh rave' from across the 
pond), helped keep my sanity during my last 2 years in the USMC.

I was in Dayton in mid 1979 helping organize a local cannabis smoke-in 
with what was left of the Yippies, and even though I was too young at 
the time to appreciate the gravity of what happened there I can report 
today that less than a decade out the wounds of Kent State were very 
fresh among the activists there, and Ohio was played more than once 
during my stay there, and for them it was a bit more than just a song 
playing on the radio.

As far as music being co-opted by politicians goes, you'd be hard 
pressed to to do better than to find Rudy Ghouliani using The Clash's 
"Rudy Can't Fail" as his campaign's version of "Hail To The Chief" every 
time he entered a room.

Unless, of course, you've got Governor Iron Mike Huckabee playing bass 
on one of the greatest anti-war anthems of the 1960s.

Creedence Clearwater's, (btw, not a Southern bunch of hick shit-kicker 
rockers, but an El Cerrito, (birthplace of 420), CA, band. Go figure. 
You can look it up),:

"Fortunate Son".

http://video.aol.com/video-detail/capitol-offense-fortunate-son/2230602459

You can't make this shit up.

That, and its a pretty good cover, to boot.

And the Song *Ohio* was only one of many anti-war, anti-establishment, and anti-government songs of that era.  True *Ohio* came out just days after the shootings at Kent State, an event which turned many who were previously on the fence against the government at the time.  I am sure that many felt that *Ohio* perfectly captured the emotion and zetgeist of that moment.  However to attribute this to the song rather than the events is revisionist at best.  Certainly the song didn't end the Vietnam War single handedly by any reasonable assessment.  So I don't get the surprise or dismay that there isn't such a "war ending song" today.

For the under financed, you might want to check out Pronoia DJs with the Wildlife SF crew at Shine tomororw for just $0.99 cover.

That's tomorrow, Saturday, not tonight guys and gals.

Hell at that price you can afford to go twice.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Music cannot change the world, says Neil Young

Just saying it was the shootings that turned people against the government and galvanized the peace movement not the song.  The Russian revolution would have happened even if "The International" was never written I think.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationale ) But certainly a good song can encourage people or amplify an emotion and perhaps thereby contribute to a movement.  But I can't think of an example where a movement was started by a song alone.   Unless maybe it was The Macarena ;)

Intreresting story about Dayton...ever go to the Pine Club?  I went there many times when I did work at WPAFB.  Strong mixed drinks, a great steak, and cheesebread.  Midwest cuisine ats best!

And FWIW I grew up in north Berkeley not far from EC.  The Fantasy Records building was in Berkeley on Spruce I believe.  We used to stop and smoke on these sort of large open steps they have there sometimes when we walked home from parties sort of in homage.  This was during that same era, the late 70s, although in Berkeley at that time you heard more punk than Creedence.  But we still heard a lot of hippy rhetoric this being Berkeley and all.  Some of it turned out to be right!

But by this time it was more about White Punks On Dope than Peace & Love & taking care of nature.  It was "how far can you go?", not "where are you going?".

In my experience anyway...

Best,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Music cannot change the world, says Neil Young

When my GF's childhood gymnastic tutors in Portola Valley retired to 
move to Hawaii, Neil, being a plugged in local, showed up for the 
ceremony. I made a point of not interacting in the parking lot after, 
but I did note that he tools around in Woodside in a pretty funky circa 
1970s Woody station wagon. And maybe music can't stop wars, but judging 
by what I saw at the annual Bridge School Concerts at Shoreline, it can 
be a positive force for good, so I'm thinking Neil said all that because 
he's getting older and crankier.

His "Freedom" album, (which you may be most familiar with from Michael 
Moore's Fahrenheit 9/!! credit roll), along with Big Audio Dynamite, (my 
musical introduction to that thing called 'teh rave' from across the 
pond), helped keep my sanity during my last 2 years in the USMC.

I was in Dayton in mid 1979 helping organize a local cannabis smoke-in 
with what was left of the Yippies, and even though I was too young at 
the time to appreciate the gravity of what happened there I can report 
today that less than a decade out the wounds of Kent State were very 
fresh among the activists there, and Ohio was played more than once 
during my stay there, and for them it was a bit more than just a song 
playing on the radio.

As far as music being co-opted by politicians goes, you'd be hard 
pressed to to do better than to find Rudy Ghouliani using The Clash's 
"Rudy Can't Fail" as his campaign's version of "Hail To The Chief" every 
time he entered a room.

Unless, of course, you've got Governor Iron Mike Huckabee playing bass 
on one of the greatest anti-war anthems of the 1960s.

Creedence Clearwater's, (btw, not a Southern bunch of hick shit-kicker 
rockers, but an El Cerrito, (birthplace of 420), CA, band. Go figure. 
You can look it up),:

"Fortunate Son".

http://video.aol.com/video-detail/capitol-offense-fortunate-son/2230602459

You can't make this shit up.

That, and its a pretty good cover, to boot.

Certainly the song didn't end the Vietnam War single handedly by any reasonable assessment.  So I don't get the surprise or dismay that there isn't such a "war ending song" today.

Neil Young just reissued "Live at Massey Hall, 1971":

http://www.amazon.com/Live-at-Massey-Hall-1971/dp/B000MTPANG

This was recorded less than a year after Kent State, and just before his 
classic "Harvest" album came out. The venue is his native Ontario, Canada, 
just Neil on guitar or piano. You can feel the love from the crowd. Highly 
recommended.

I participate in this week long bike ride across the state of Iowa every 
year.  And one year, during the height of the Macarena craze, I started 
to use the fact of hearnig that song a SECOND time to determine that I 
was in town too long.  The shortest stretch??? 30 MINUTES. Yikes!

But back to the impact a SONG had on ending the vietnam war; don't you 
suppose THE DRAFT might have had a bit higher impact??

And the video is pretty damn good too!  (I seem to remember some 
reasonably different takes on a song or two, as opposed to their well 
known (and famous) versions.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Music cannot change the world, says Neil Young

Speaking as someone that had John Phillip Souza Marches rammed down his 
throat as a child, as well as got slapped around almost daily with our 
National Anthem, (a re-purposed British drinking song, written by one of 
my fellow alumns at the Neo-Con U. that Leo Strauss died at, the only 
other claim to fame my College has, besides the founder of Atlantic 
Records starting that company in his dorm room), France's Le Marseilles, 
and the aforementioned The Internationale, by my whack-job East German 
raised moms, I'd say that music an incredibly powerful force, and that 
the governments and corporations of the world are much more than aware 
of the fact of the power of that force than we seem to be, since not 
only do they use it to their advantage to manipulate people into buying 
their crap products and going off to die in their wars, but any time 
music comes along that they feel might be a threat to them they'll do 
their damndest to co-opt it (see: Hip-Hop/Rap), or drive it out of 
existence (see: The RAVE Act II).

What, did you really think it was the 'chill-rooms' that had these folks 
worried?

Actually, due to 'chill-rooms' being where people exercise their right 
to 'freely assemble', that's the thing they really don't like, because 
unlike in a Sports Arena where everyone is facing one way, and not 
communicating with each other, past root-root-rooting for the Home Team, 
people in 'chill-rooms' actually look each other in the eye and talk to 
one another. That wouldn't happen if there wasn't the music to bring 
them there, so our government went out of its way to nip that shit in 
the bud.

Did a bang-up job of it, too, since you're more likely today in the USA 
to hear EDM in a Stupid Ugly Vehicle TV commercial than to be able to 
find a decent renegade UG Party to go to tonight.

Can you say "Mission Accomplished"?
I know you can.

It's been said that good music comes from hard times, (see: Nirvana, 
Woody Guthrie, the 1960s, R&B, etc, etc), and being that we're not in a 
recession, but at the very start of an unacknowledged Second Great 
American Depression, I expect these musical arts to flower and come into 
full bloom very shortly.

But yh, if you want to have some rilly GREAT music, I say bring back Teh 
Military Draft and it'll make your head spin as to how great the toonage 
becomes overnight and how quickly people will lose interest in American 
Idol.

Be glad you missed it this year because, who knows, you might have had 
to deal with Willard Mitt "Joe Isuzu" Romney's 5 wild-eyed boys and 
their 5 Brother's Bus MittMobile as it wended its way through all of 
Iowa's 99 counties. http://fivebrothers.mittromney.com/blog/comments/40 
and, given how psycho their religion is, I can only imagine that their 
driving couldn't be much better.
More on vid here: http://tinyurl.com/3ashnq with my personal fave being 
the Greta Van Sustern interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG1IOtmY7SY

Not that the MittMobile Tour did any good, considering that Huckabee 
handed Romney his ass in Iowa and literally ate his very expensive 
lunch, but at least it kept all of them Romney boys from wearing a 
uniform and carrying a rifle in Iraq, because they love America so, so 
there is that.

Have you ever stopped to consider the idea that while to you and me the 
$50 billion dollars spent in the USA every year on the War On Drugs 
seems like an incredible waste of money, that to them it might be money 
very well spent?

Not only that, but to them The War On Drugs is not only going quite 
well, thank you very much, but that they are succeeding beyond their 
wildest dreams with it?

Just a thought.

The Macarena is my Exhibit motherfucking A and totally proves my point 
about how good times of relative peace and prosperity end up producing 
crap music.

Like I said, we can't reinstate The Draft soon enough in this country.

Now, I'm on a tear and can't help myself, here's what Frank Zappa had to

Greta Van Susteren is the living embodiment of the axiom that you can 
have all the money in the world for plastic surgery, but if you're a 
mealy-mouthed bitch, the best surgeons in the world can't fix that.

Same goes for Vice Big Dick Cheney, he's got the same kind of 
shit-talking mouf as her.

Maybe it's a Fox News thing.

I dunno, I'd say The War On Drugs has been mad successful when you 
consider the following....

750,000+ arrests a year for just marijuana alone, which keeps a lot of 
cops, judges, probation officers and prisons in fine feather, just to 
name a few entities that economically benefit from those arrests, a 
non-stop, multi-billion dollar a year, money-making, predatorial, Drug & 
Alcohol Re-Hab Industry, (that will *never* go out of business), that 
has an annual fail rate of 90%, but still manages to have new people 
coming in the door, each, and everyday, (See: Kirsten Dunst and every 
Drug Court Ordered "Client" for next 10 years), millions of dollars a 
month landing in 12 Step Recovery baskets, just in the USA alone, as 
well as Big Book and other ancilliary Recovery product sales, a price 
mark-up on the production and distribution costs of street drugs in the 
5,000% range, with marijuana retailing at very near up to $10K a pound 
for the Primo Shit, and a population that's so deluded by the barrage of 
media telling them that drugs are bad that they're never, never, ever 
going to see it another way.

What's really Teh Awesome is when the kids buy into this shit wholesale, 
(because they're too young to know any better and the cable TV got to 
them first), and snitch on Mommy & Daddy's pot smoking to the Police and 
The State gets to destroy that family:
http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/dare4.htm

Don't you think that that kind of shit makes our Drug Warriors not only 
positively blush, but wet their pants with unbridled glee?

Try putting yourself in their shoes, for a spell, if you think different.

Now, it while it may be true that there are no recorded fatalities from 
marijuana use, there is at least one case on record where fear of arrest 
over a dime bag of pot killed a guy: 
http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/Southwest/11/20/marijuana.death.ap/

And while we're at it, Civil Asset Forfeiture is nice work too, if you 
can get it.
http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v99.n1252.a01.html
Short version, be caught with one sapling growing in your home for 
personal use, say Goodbye, McMansion.

The attendant erosion of our Civil Rights was probably nothing more an 
unexpected bonus to these people.

With all that, I'd have to say that these War On Drugs guys are doing 
alright for themselves.

Ya know what I mean, Vern?

Darn, seems I checked my eMail a bit too late and missed this show.

new mix from Andy W for quite a while.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tonight on Radio Integrated : Andy W, Thomas B, DJ STML : 2.08.08

Yep, except for a few shows where a software update wiped the archive  
setting and I didn't notice. We'll have them up before summer. Still  
figuring out a media server solution for them. (each show is about  
300MB, so a standard web host thing won't work).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Music cannot change the world, says Neil Young

Amazing just how fucked my memory of this location was...OK, its been about 30 years but after you corrected me I looked on the map and had a sort of strange experience of vertigo as my rusty mental map of Berkeley slowly creaked into proper alignment.  

And a strange memory came back to me of a party I went to on Parker back in 9th grade, and then kissing this girl on the steps of Fantasy.  I don't remember her name this morning, but I remember the kiss and the fact that she moved to Florida the next week and I never saw her again.

Best,

Peter

Fantasy is on parker - 1 block away from where I work.  It's owned by 
Concord now, but it still says Fantasy on the building.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: FISA and retroactive telecom immunity

>From another list, but I agree fully.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Hey guys,

Sorry if this seems generic, but I feel very strongly about this
issue, and it's a tough one to sound-bite so I'm providing links
rather than explanations (again).

The Senate is voting again tomorrow (Tuesday Feb 12th) on whether to
pass the FISA reauthorization bill which includes retroactive immunity
for telecoms turning over information to the bush administration
without a warrant.  PLEASE CALL your senators and representatives to
tell them you DO NOT WANT THIS BILL PASSED WITH RETROACTIVE IMMUNITY
NO MATTER WHAT.

Below is a link to a bulleted list regarding what the bill does for
corporations and the Bush administration and why we MUST not allow our
representatives to pass this bill:

http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/library/article.php?ID=6680

Please spread this around, people need to know what their senators are
doing in their name!

Below is an article explaining more about FISA from Senator Russ
Feingold:

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/1/17/104227/863/70/438259

You can find your senators contact information here:

http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

Below are the phone numbers of the senators who have so far voted for
retroactive immunity on earlier versions of this bill, please call
them and (politely) urge them to respect the Constitution, the
judicial branch of government, and the separation of powers and do not
let this bill go through!

Which is why the corporate mainstream media is so reticent with it.

Breaking the Drug Taboo: Group of Traumatized Veterans Get  
Experimental Ecstasy Treatment
By Scott Thill, AlterNet
Posted on February 11, 2008, Printed on February 11, 2008
http://www.alternet.org/story/76576/

"We need to be positioning ourselves now to provide the assistance  
that our veterans need," said House Committee on Veterans' Affairs  
chairman Bob Filner (D-CA) during a hearing, called "Stopping  
Suicides: Examining the Mental Health Challenges Facing the Department  
of Veterans Affairs," held in December 2007. "Not only for those brave  
men and women who are returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, but  
also for our veterans from previous conflicts. We cannot afford to put  
this issue off."

Filner's choice of words is instructive, as are his sentiments: With  
upwards of 25 million veterans in the United States, not counting  
those overseas in the morally murky theater of Iraq and Afghanistan  
who may return home sometime after the 2008 presidential election,  
that's a lot of assistance and funding needed to head off what he  
called a "rate of veteran suicide [that] has reached epidemic  
proportions," to the point that it has doubled the suicide rate of  
civilians. Safeguards already put into place have failed, for a  
variety of reasons, and given the severity of the mental and physical  
problems carried by returning soldiers, some daring out-of-the-box  
thinking is not only desperately needed, but required.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Hey guys,

Sorry if this seems generic, but I feel very strongly about this
issue, and it's a tough one to sound-bite so I'm providing links
rather than explanations (again).

The Senate is voting again tomorrow (Tuesday Feb 12th) on whether to
pass the FISA reauthorization bill which includes retroactive immunity
for telecoms turning over information to the bush administration
without a warrant.  PLEASE CALL your senators and representatives to
tell them you DO NOT WANT THIS BILL PASSED WITH RETROACTIVE IMMUNITY
NO MATTER WHAT.

Below is a link to a bulleted list regarding what the bill does for
corporations and the Bush administration and why we MUST not allow our
representatives to pass this bill:

http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/library/article.php?ID=6680

Please spread this around, people need to know what their senators are
doing in their name!

Below is an article explaining more about FISA from Senator Russ
Feingold:

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/1/17/104227/863/70/438259

You can find your senators contact information here:

http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

Below are the phone numbers of the senators who have so far voted for
retroactive immunity on earlier versions of this bill, please call
them and (politely) urge them to respect the Constitution, the
judicial branch of government, and the separation of powers and do not
let this bill go through!

Translation:  she's going to vote for it

Peter

Subject: [sfraves]  :: West Coast Techno last friday (29 Feb 2008) at Anu ::




Friday, 29 February 2008

RAY presents: 

F A K T I O N : because SF needs another techno cult
with special guests:

DJ Developer -- Modularz Sound Division [ Los Angeles|the world ] 
Endosine -- Drum Machine Museum [ San Francisco|Berlin ] // Live

 
Anu-Bar 
43 Sixth St., San Francisco, CA

DJ Developer is known throughout the US, Mexico and abroad for quick mixing
abilities and for leading LA's second wave of Techno.  In 2004 he shifted his
focus to production.  Now in 2008 he demonstrates his mastery of both: He
launched the label "Modularz Sound Division" with Detroit legend Fanon Flowers
(now living in Los Angeles) and is performing in public again, producing shows
under the Modularz name, featuring various talented artists from LA and
elsewhere.

Join us for this San Francisco appearance before Developer begins the European
leg of his tour in Spain and beyond.

Endosine: Literally translated, Endosine is the wave within. The modulating
force within all existence. Techno is everywhere, an element of the natural
and mechanized constructs around us. Connect to the wave within. Connect to
Endosine.

This will be Endosine's last US appearance before he flies off to Berlin for
an extended stay, working on production and advancing the standards of Techno
and Electronica.

10 PM to 2 AM
Cost: $5

I was always scared of guns growing up. But this situation has told me
I need one. I'd rather be prepared than to be like Sean was and not
have a gun in his house when he really needed it.

Where are the Ben Franklin's and Thomas Paine's of the present political
landscape?  Perhaps Adams and Hamilton have triumphed in their aspirations
to minimize the will of the people.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR- Feinstein vots agenst Sen. Dodds ....

I'm trying to find the Thomas Jefferson of today.
"How soon the labor of men would make a paradise of the whole earth, 
were it not for misgovernment, and a diversion of all his energies from 
their proper object -- the happiness of man, -- to the selfish interests 
of kings, nobles, and priests.  If we can prevent the government from 
wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of taking care of 
them, they must become happy.  We who have gone before have performed an 
honest duty, by putting in the power of our successors a state of 
happiness which no nation ever before had within their choice."

"When I first entered on the stage of public life, I came to a 
resolution never to engage while in public office in any kind of 
enterprise for the improvement of my fortune, nor to wear any other 
character than that of a farmer.  I have never departed from it in a 
single instance.  Thus I have thought myself richer in contentment than 
I should have been with any increase of fortune."

"Never think of taking a book with you.  The object of walking is to 
relax the mind.  You should, therefore, not permit yourself even to 
think while you walk; but divert yourself by the objects surrounding 
you.  A little walk of an hour, in the morning, when you first arise, is 
advisable.  It shakes off sleep, and produces other good effects in the 
animal economy.  Rise at a fixed and early hour, and go to bed at a 
fixed and early hour also.  Sitting up late at night is injurious to the 
health, and not useful to the mind."

(Guess that one cuts out partying. :) )

"The exact truth should be told.  They will believe the good, if we 
candidly tell them the bad also.  Honesty promotes interest in the long 
run.  I can conscientiously decalre that as to myself, I wish that not 
only no act but no thought of mine should be unknown."

Read more quotes, arranged by topic, in a book (who's editor I 
interviewed on An Epiphany Of Sound) here:

And you say this just becasue her amendment would have given a secret court the power to dismiss the telco lawsuits if it found that the companies acted in good faith and on the request of the president or attorney general?  

http://feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=a8c98f50-0fc5-e54d-c5f8-ad3a4d4dedb2

But then again the senate tossed her amendment so the point is somewhat moot.

Personally I don't view the President as Emperor and above the law.  I 
think the telcos, with their legions of lawyers, were quite capable of 
determining whether or not going along with this was against the law or 
not.

Yes but Doug you have to remember that though we don't see Bush as an  
Emporer and above the law, he does, and his behavior in office backs  
that up, I think people are probably even more well versed in the  
details here than I am but recent executive orders, patriot act 1 and  
2, etc. etc.

I think at some point it's going to take a certain amount of people,  
I don't know how many, to just say this government no longer supports  
any of my needs, I'm not going to support or recognize this  
government.  I'm sort of indirectly quoting Mike Rivero, who does  
visuals for ABC's Lost and runs the website whatreallyhappened.com.   
I agree with him when he says he thinks this government is eventually  
going to just collapse on its own weight.  Look at Congress with 11%  
approval rating in some polls.

Anyway, I'm just putting 2 cents in, it's not like I was expecting  
anyone to jump out of their seats and drive down here so we can march  
on the Capital. ;]

I'd settle for a reasonable amount of folks walking around in 'V' 
costumes (which I'll actually assume have some level of illegality under 
today's gestapo.)  I know they were out there protesting the church of 
scientology this past Sunday!

We're doing it up right this year with an impressive line-up of dance
floor romeos and breakbeat heart-throbs to get those bodies moving. Expect

also featuring a special kissing booth for the lovers, themed Valentines

mood.

The Fingermonsters
myspace.com/fingermonsters

Comprised of Andrew Phelan, Cubik, Origami, and Compulse, these men are no
strangers to the underground scene. Separately, they are well respected
for their individual skills, but together they form a Live PA goliath
designed to get that jello jigglin. This Bay Area foursome have been know
to cause mass confusion on the dance floor with their multiple drum
machines, knob fiddling, and general lap-top freakery. The Fingermonsters
are a four man militia whose mission is to breaks hearts, and incite
hysteria.

I know a bunch of people were expecting a show from us in January, but
instead of pushing forward with a show that just wasn't quite right, we
decided to move it to February. So here we are, coming at you with a show
that we KNOW will deliver. We're teaming up with False Profit for this
one, and along with the 2 UK headliners and a stellar local lineup, this
is really one you can't afford to miss.

AMB
(Chi-Recordings/Sinister/Money Shot/Audio Therapy/EQ) - UK

Based in London, but with roots in Hungarys Chi Recordings, Ambrus Deak
a.k.a. AMB, has been in music production, engineering, and label
management for over seven years.

Co-founder and a fundamental cog in Chi Recordings, he also appears on
Reacts 21st Century Breaks, Distinctives Y4K, EQ Recordings, and Dave
Saemans Audio Therapy. AMB was responsible for one of the most remarkable
breakbeat tracks of 2002, Romeo, which obtained second place on
Breakspoll, The International Breakbeat Awards, best single category in
2003. Support comes from Hybrid, Nick Warren, Roger Sanchez, James Zabiela
, Laurent Garnier, Elite Force, Chris Carter, Plump DJs, Terminalhead,
Meat Katie, Tayo, General Midi, Hyper, and many more. AMB is supported by
todays leading international provider of digital audio and MIDI
solutions, M-Audio. And when hes not making music or spinning records, he
puts on his mastering suit, or makes soundtracks for commercials, theatre
and the film industry.

As a DJ he has played in the USA, UK, France, Germany, Russia, Croatia,
Serbia, Hungary alongside The Chemical Brothers, Adam Freeland, Hybrid,
Chris Carter, Elite Force, General Midi, and a whole lot more.

Diverted
(Diverted Traffic/TCR/Sokolov Sounds/Mofo/ibreaks) - UK

DIVERTED are DJ/Producers and Label Owners Stephen Baxter and Lee
Richardson. They have produced a string of well received releases on
Sokolov Sounds, TCR and AIR which helped them find their grounding in the
breaks scene. This has also spurred the guys on to creating their album
which is being put together hand-in-hand with an exciting live show
involving vocalists, live instruments from the guys themselves and
contributions from other Djs and artists around them including Nine Lives
the Cat. Check out their myspace page for regular updates, videos, gig
schedule and news as this album takes shape.

The last year has taken them all around the world Djing their sound to the
masses. Particularly memorable nights have been at the infamous HUM
events, Drop Beats Not Bombs, Chew the Fat @ The End, Breakspoll @ Fabric,
Glade Festival and tours of Australia and Russia saw appreciation for the
boys outside the UK.

 Along with E.B. residents:

February 21st 2008

Goldie (Metalheadz, UK)
In his own words:
Hey you blokes. My name is Goldie, and I represent that pure raw UK drum
and bass sound. My main goals in life include: making sick drum and bass
tracks that come off as crazy dance floor monsters (regardless if they all
sound the same), clipping mixers untill those red lights light up to the
top, destroying high end sound systems around the world, making peopls
eardrums explode, and trying to accomplish putting on all my gold
accessories in under 30 minutes time.

Goldie is an English electronic music artist, disc jockey, and actor. As a
musician he works mainly within the jungle and drum n bass genres, and has
helped to promote these styles globally. By 1991, Goldie had become
fascinated by the British breakbeat music scene; and his girlfriend, DJ
Kemistry, introduced him to the pioneering jungle/drum'n'bass producers
Dennis 'Dego' McFarlane and Mark 'Marc Mac' Clair, known as 4hero.  His
first globally released album, Timeless, followed in 1995. Timeless shot
straight into the charts at number seven, which was a first for a drum 'n'
bass record.  In 2002, Goldie said that he had been working for three
years on a film called Sine Tempus, described as a coming-of-age story of
a young paintbrush artist, and in 2006 announced its soundtrack as his new
album. As of 2008, album and film have not been released yet.  Goldie is
also known for his work as the leader of the Rufige Kru. This group has no
fixed members; it has included some of most well-known drum and bass
producers such as Technical Itch, Heist, Teebee, Cujo, Agzilla Da Ice, Doc
Scott and Rob Playford.

I'd settle for a reasonable amount of folks walking around in 'V' 
costumes (which I'll actually assume have some level of illegality under 
today's gestapo.)  I know they were out there protesting the church of 
scientology this past Sunday!

Well, I remember people were protesting Feinstein back in '97 in  
downtown, I can't see why it couldn't happen now if someone organized  
it, or if you were talking about just random people showing up that  
all happened to be wearing the same costume.  haha

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Wed)

There's been rumors circulating around that the Quote of the Day will  
be moving to the DCRaves list while there is remodeling going on in  
the SFRaves list.  I am not sure why I am spreading these rumors, but  
I would say that is a completely silly notion.  The Quote of the Day  
belongs on SFR and nowhere else.  I might be open minded to a one-off,  
of course, but that's just what it is - a one-off.  Have a nice day.

Once a government resorts to terror against its own population to get  
what it wants, it must keep using terror against its own population to  
get what it wants. A government that terrorizes its own people can  
never stop. If such a government ever lets the fear subside and  
rational thought return to the populace, that government is finished.

OK folks, the rumors are true. 1300 Potrero is closing down for good! In an effort to say goodbye to a space we've all had many good times in, the kids of Want It have decided to throw one last party at the loft/warehouse. So... come out and celebrate with us in our carnival of sin!!!

i want to be careful not to spread misinformation here, but i know there are a few addresses in that same block of buildings. the whole big bad mama is supposedly being torn down completely to make room for new commercial office space. i'm not sure exactly which addresses are affected. i'll see if i can dig up more information on the locations besides 1300 specifically...

love,
mo

i just spoke to one of the tenants, and the word is that the following addresses are expected to be affected by the shakeup on that block:

"1320, 1310, 1300 potrero and 2801, 2801A 25th street"

:(

hopefully more of the units will also elect to have a final blowout. i'd recommend getting your partying in over there while you can. change is in the air...

love,
mo

Subject: [sfraves] BSP::2.15.8 another night of sucka free techno on radio integrated
 2.15.8::PSB

this week 2.15.:
its SUCKA FREE techno night with the sounds of:

->DJ Alex Windsor

If anybody's ever seen Alex in action you know what a great talent he 
has for the wheels of steel and a great sense of flow and mastery he has 
for them. Originally from London, UK, Alex has been instrumental in the 
San Francisco Techno (with a capital T) scene here since 1992 as a 
partner in the Gaia Mantra Record store in SF and as a promoter and 
resident of MAD mondays.. for those of you who don't know, MAD used to 
be where it was at for Techno in SF from 95-97 Giving voice to the early 
SF minimal techno scene and showcasing techno that would probably had 
been not heard anywhere else in the city at the time. Alex's skills have 
taken him all across the globe, from the US to Japan, and the UK. He has 
played alongside the likes of Aphex Twin, the Shamen, Orbital, Carl 
Craig, Richie hawtin, Moby, Mr.C, Juan Atkins, Mark Broom, & Dave Clarke 
to name a few.... He's Dj'd at parties here in SF by crews with such 
infamously dope names names as FnF, Harmony, Area 51, Tribal Future, 
Gateway, Brass Tax , Future &  more undergrounds than my short term 
memory loss can muster.

->Dj Perla
http://www.myspace.com/perladanceusted

   Perla has appeared on Radio Integrated before and totally has rocked 
it with his own live material.. Perla originally hails from southern 
spain where he helped promote his Dance Usted parties or, 'Dance Please' 
As bulletproof and flawless as his original tracks are, his selection 
skills are equally unbeatable. we are pleased to welcome Perla back this 
time for a special mixed set of his pick of tracks that have been 
influencing him and shaping his current sound to date.  Perla will be 
pumping up the set with an all ableton set, but as he says " Just 
playing songs in a computer like a DJ mixing with records is something 
like, you know, too lazy?  -and it all seems like no big deal.. Like we 
say in Spain, that's like killing flies with a cannon! So I want to mix 
a lot of songs, like with really quick mixing and also add some of my 
stuff, percusive loops, synth lines etc...."   i can't wait. `;)

coming in the following weeks..

2.22.8 ILL-Ectro night featuring Djs Indigo and Sheztek note:'doing the 
robot' is forbidden.. unless you're calling it locking and poppin' then 
its ok.

2.29.8 Leap year techno live at Faktion SF with DJ Developer from LA and 
Endosine (live p.a.) BTW..the drinks at the club are better than the 
screwdrivers you make at home.

3.7.8 keeping it real with Caltrop and Clairity. never heard a bad 
record dropped from either of 'em & this night should be no exception. 
every set i've heard from either of these two has been well thought out 
and well seasoned with intelligent groovin' techno tracks.

techno is taking over!

the term =93Hip Hop=94, encompassing the elements of music, graffiti, =20=

dance and knowledge, thereby identifying Hip Hop as a unique culture =20
unto itself. After his 1982 hit sensation, =93Planet Rock=94 , Bambaataa =
=20

Artists, DJs and Emcees, providing the world with a glimpse of the =20

Klein (the nufunk producer whose Plastic Starfish album follows 4 =20

solemn pledge to the memory of James Brown to help his legacy live on.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: job leads?

hi kidz,

i'm looking for a job. whee!

I have a ridiculously huge set of job skills, but something in the  
following fields would be preferred:

- construction interior design/remodeling/CNC woodworking
- landscape architecture/permaculture design
- offset print design/prepress/production
- catalog design/production
- long document layout/design
- screen printing design/production/separations/prepress
- Photoshop high-end retouching/photo restoration
- Adobe Illustrator vector graphics/technical illustration/ 
informational graphics

lemme know what'cha got, or if you hear of something.

i'm available immediately - or in other words, i can be there in 15  
minutes. really!

I live in Berkeley, so downtown SF, Oakland, or Berkeley would be  
best, though elsewhere in the East Bay would work too.  also, I have a  
loaded G5 and can do the computer-y stuff at home.

thanks!
philip

Oh, right, that would explain why Daft Punk is a bigger act in the USA 
than Kanye West is, and why he's lucky to get the exposure by their 
sampling his work. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDxT19wNtY4

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

I just wanted to let you know from a good source that I am never just  
joking about anything.  In fact, I'm just not joking right now as I  
utter these characters in this moment in time.  Time.

By the way, yesterday, I took a run up to the Loma Prieta epicenter,  
well I almost made it, but that last hill killed me so I turned back.   
Just thought you might want to know, I like to let you know every move  
I make, extraneous thoughts, etc.

Here's an excerpt from a class project I'm doing, a 2-minute dialogue  
from a play of my choosing (had to be American), Gore Vidal's "An  
Evening With Richard Nixon", if you can imagine me playing him.  Nice  
day.  This is an actual quote by the way.  Most of the play are quotes.

--

This is a generation that wants to laugh, a generation that wants to  
be entertained.  I guess television made it that way.

- Richard Nixon

I think that all depends what you consider "affordable."  I've been wanting
to go to this place for a while, and have heard their food is on par with
slanted door, but at a lesser price- Dragonfly.  It's in the Inner Sunset,
on Judah around 8th  or 9th Ave.

I second Bens suggestion.. having been to both places Slanted Door is
the better of the two but Dragonfly has good atmosphere, tasty food
and fair prices.
http://www.yelp.com/biz/dragonfly-restaurant-san-francisco

I favorite of mine in the Mission area is Ti Couz (16 @ Valencia)
serves French style and crepes.

idk know about "on par" but its solid place.  You won't be complaining.

marco, IMO there's too many great places to recommend just one, you really need to narrow it down by cuisine or something.

In the Mission a lot of people are talking about Range, http://www.rangesf.com/, but I wouldn't call it affordable.  I also like Dosa http://www.dosasf.com/ but again not cheap.

On the cheap, I like Puerto Allegre and Pakwan.

Weird Fish is somewhere in the middle and not bad either: http://www.weirdfishsf.com/

Best,

Peter

I think that all depends what you consider "affordable."  I've been wanting
to go to this place for a while, and have heard their food is on par with
slanted door, but at a lesser price- Dragonfly.  It's in the Inner Sunset,
on Judah around 8th  or 9th Ave.

Tell me what ethnic food types these spots are...the only type of food that 
is "out" for this dinner would be Thai, just cuz we have both had a ton 
recently.

Thanks again for the help y'all!!!

(oh yea, by "affordable", I mean, for two people, under $100 would be nice)

Where to start? 

Their set was ENTIRELY composed of ORIGINAL 45's. Only gear were some guitar foot pedals for looping, and some outboard FX.

Their set started off with some straight-up, LIVE, from-scratch, HOUSE MUSIC. 

Holy sh!T! They mixed everything in from 'Rock Around The Clock' to things I've never heard before. Towards the end they strapped on some portable decks & mixers and scratched in guitar samples over a metal loop. 

Kid Koala also played a dope opening set, lot of stuff off the new CD. Anybody else make it out? What a night.

BTW, sup yall!

peace

It was over here[1] and was an absolutely amazing
show.  Koala's set felt way too short even for an
opener.  I've seen him a few other times and his
shows are a lot of fun.

The Shadow/Chemist sets were beyond original it is
difficult to know where to begin.  It was nice they
had a introduction "tutorial" of what exactly they
were going to be doing.  I was sitting in the balcony
and overheard a few people trying to explain what
they were going to be seeing to their friends.  Some
were right and others were... at the wrong show.

One technique that is amazing is where they fabricated
a off-center 45 turntable which created one of a kind
sounds from played 45s.

Some parts of the set weren't my favorite, but I'd
like to attribute it to my post surgical (Monday)
Vicodin haze I was in all day.

Yeah, can't forget the off-center 45, and trippy, off-center, rotating visuals to go with. The 45's invading the City was a pretty badass clip too.

That little invisible circle on the wall in my office is still spinning! Off center!!!

The Shadow/Chemist sets were beyond original it is
difficult to know where to begin.  It was nice they
had a introduction "tutorial" of what exactly they
were going to be doing.  I was sitting in the balcony
and overheard a few people trying to explain what
they were going to be seeing to their friends.  Some
were right and others were... at the wrong show.

One technique that is amazing is where they fabricated
a off-center 45 turntable which created one of a kind
sounds from played 45s.

Some parts of the set weren't my favorite, but I'd
like to attribute it to my post surgical (Monday)
Vicodin haze I was in all day.

Range is California cuisine I guess, Dosa is South Indian.

Weird Fish, is uh, Fish. 

All of these could be done around $50 or less depending on your level of hunger and thirst.  Range is hot right now, so it might be hard to get a table.  Dosa fills up, but you can walk in if you go early.  Never had to wait at Weird Fish.

Tell me what ethnic food types these spots are...the only type of food that 
is "out" for this dinner would be Thai, just cuz we have both had a ton 
recently.

Thanks again for the help y'all!!!

(oh yea, by "affordable", I mean, for two people, under $100 would be nice)

Hmm. I think you've been snookered by the conspiracy theory press.

FWIW I used to work for the guys in the US Army in charge of urban warfare training and I still know a few things about Mobile Operations in Urban Terrain aka MOUT.  My company developed a concept for a virtual reality training simulator in the mid-nineties and I wrote a well known report on the applicaiton of virtual reality to training and simulation at the time.  

We also got to spend a week at Ft. Benning Georgia training with several different groups.  While its true that they have their own urban warfare training ranges, i.e. the McKenna range at Fort Benning, these are not really realistic environments in many ways.  The Marines have an urban combat center at Twentynine Palms that is supposed to be the largest facility in the world, see http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/913342

But these facilities are all known to the forces and there are some things that the ranges can't and don't simulate.  Frankly I can totally see the guys I used to work with cooking up something like the Marine's Toledo training plan without ever considering the political fall out.  Not sure this event says much about impending marital law therefore.  

IMO, this story is 99.9% likely just due to some overzealous training guys that had a "brilliant" idea to use an abandoned office building for live fire training and almost got away with it.  You did realize that the planned exercise was for a small unit to conduct live fire exercises inside one abandoned office building in Toledo right?  So not enough men to take and control a city were even involved.  Plus if you were going to institute martial law you'd want to do a "training exercise" in every other city in the US right?  And don't try to tell me they're just starting with Toledo...;)

Read the bit in this article about the problems in teaching and training MOUT:  http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,NI_1104_Urban-P1,00.html

Best,

Peter

I mean, I know it seems like a stretch at 1st - but when you factor in how a 
shitload of our Constitutional rights are being hacked away bit-by-bit, and 
you see more and more US missions/wars in Urban centers (Bosnia, Iraq, 
Serbia, etc.), then you see US attempting drills within our own cities 
rather than at training facilities...it smacks of impending ickiness.

I am quite sure the US has got to have some sort of contingency plans for 
"what if" scenarios like civil war, class war, race war, etc. - all of which 
would most likely take place primarily in urban centers.

I know they are finally starting to look at the rise of gang member 
enrollment in US military - although not doing much about it - and finding 
that urban gangs are sending members to be trained by the military for more 
effectiveness in their illicit activities.

Food for thought at the very least....

My bigger concern, instead of uneducated gang-bangers enlisting in the 
Army, is the infiltration of Evangelical Fundies in places like the Air 
Force Academy. http://tinyurl.com/2vnscr

Look at how much damage 10 engineering students did with just 4 hijacked 
commercial passenger planes, and then consider what could happen if a 
whole Chain of Command that controlled Stealth Bombers, loaded with 
*live nukes* got it into their heads that they were on a "Mission From God."

That could get real messy, right quick.

Not that the rise of the Evangelicals in the ranks of the Army isn't a 
problem as well, this just hit the wires today:

Well, I am not saying martial law will happen tomorrow or anything, but it 
stands to reason that our military may be training for potential urban 
warfare scenarios in the future.

Piss off enough of your citizens and it's not exactly a far stretch to 
imagine they might wanna revolt.

The Army is absolutely training for future urban warfare scenarios and has been for some time.  Same with the Marines and other units.  That doesn't prove they are planning to deploy in the US.  FWIW this sort of training has been going on for over 20 years and has developed to include live fire training, virtual reality, and computer game simulations.

Remember our armed forces in Iraq are having trouble subduing a population of less than 30 million people.  America has 300 million people and it is huge.  You are going to need a large force, at least 1 million well armed soldiers IMO, to control the US populace.   Show me some evidence of large scale deployments around the country and I'll start believing in the martial law thing.  

Until then I'll have to say I still beleive this is just a badly planned training exercise.

Best,

Peter

.
In Russia, about 100 years ago, under the Czars, the ppl endured 
taxation rates of 90% before they revolted.

Here in the USA, when you add everything up, rent, gas, groceries, 
child-care, taxes, etc, etc we're maybe at the 55 to 65% range, so we've 
got a ways to go yet, but even if we get there there's that Magic Hi-Def 
TV Set Top Box and 50 inch screen that can convince most people that 
that peeing on their heads is only a soft and gentle summer rain, so I 
don't think we'll be seeing any sort of uprising from the General 
Populace any time soon.

No - but maybe when they implement the "universal card" with ID, bank info, 
etc. on it - and people's identities are stolen left and right, and our 
rights are all but decimated (as is slowly happening already), and the 
Middle class has been eliminated (also happening) - people might finally get 
a little mad...maybe.

If the McDonald's doesn't just render everyone slothlike and

The metric is is that you need one soldier on the ground for every 40 
ppl to keep the population in check, which means that for Iraq we needed 
about 600,000 soldiers to do the job right and, thanks to Donny 
Rumsfeld, we went in with less than half that force.

Which is why, Surge in Baghdad not-withstanding, it's always going to be 
whack-a-mole over there.

For a country the size of the USA you'll need a force of about 7.5 
million to lock the place down, which sounds like a major reach, but 
hey, if things get far enough along, how hard would it be to Federalize 
our Municipal Police Forces?

Not that anybody in Authority is thinking along those lines: 
http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil178.pdf

Or we can just go the route China did in the 1960s and create our own 
Red Guard of 17 year olds.

Shouldn't be too hard to find volunteers, I'm sure any street kid with a 
'Stop Snitchin' T-shirt would sign right the fuck up.

something people on this list need to remember: "*Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof*"

Stop acting like religion is somehow a worse choice than atheism, both are
equally in the realm of faith and outside the realm of physical proof.  For
people who think they're progressive and forward thinking and liberal damn
some of you are intolerant, and not only that but you give yourself excuses
for your intolerance.  Nyc, the vast majority of even fundamentalist
Christians would be insulted by the insinuation that they are any less
rational than you (since to them, nuking the world in God's name would be an
act of insanity), and I as a non-fundamentalist, pacifist Christian along
with them.

As to allegations of religious intolerance at Air Force: on the basis of my
own two and a half years at the Naval Academy (and yes, I know it's a
different place and Air Force always seems to have more problems than
everyone else but it's still a military academy), I don't doubt that some
cadets were unfairly prevented the opportunity to practice their religion.
My personal experience suggests that the reason isn't intentional
discrimination but rather over-zealous caution in preventing abuse of the
system by non-religious cadets to gain extra privileges (which is a common
enough problem to warrant caution).  If your religious request is legitimate
but gets denied it takes about 20 minutes to go to your battalion chaplain,
who outranks the person who denied you by light years, and get the decision
reversed.  However, if there is real systemic discrimination, then it is
utterly inappropriate and needs to be punished and removed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: next step - MARTIAL LAW!

Anyway you cut it, the number is millions not thousands and certainly not hundreds.  And I haven't heard about police being federalized.  So no need to panic quite yet...

This story is about a few hundred guys planning to do some sort of MOUT exercise in an abandoned building that was about to be destroyed.  OK, I might rather someone threw a rave in there but this training thing isn't the begining of martial law.  

Much ado about nothing.

The metric is is that you need one soldier on the ground for every 40 
ppl to keep the population in check, which means that for Iraq we needed 
about 600,000 soldiers to do the job right and, thanks to Donny 
Rumsfeld, we went in with less than half that force.

Which is why, Surge in Baghdad not-withstanding, it's always going to be 
whack-a-mole over there.

For a country the size of the USA you'll need a force of about 7.5 
million to lock the place down, which sounds like a major reach, but 
hey, if things get far enough along, how hard would it be to Federalize 
our Municipal Police Forces?

Not that anybody in Authority is thinking along those lines: 
http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil178.pdf

Or we can just go the route China did in the 1960s and create our own 
Red Guard of 17 year olds.

Shouldn't be too hard to find volunteers, I'm sure any street kid with a 
'Stop Snitchin' T-shirt would sign right the fuck up.

The tax rate on all income over $200,000 during the depression was 94%.  Note that $200,000 was a lot of money back then, but the top rate stayed near 90% until the sixties.

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States

But there was no revolution...

Or was there?

.
In Russia, about 100 years ago, under the Czars, the ppl endured 
taxation rates of 90% before they revolted.

Here in the USA, when you add everything up, rent, gas, groceries, 
child-care, taxes, etc, etc we're maybe at the 55 to 65% range, so we've 
got a ways to go yet, but even if we get there there's that Magic Hi-Def 
TV Set Top Box and 50 inch screen that can convince most people that 
that peeing on their heads is only a soft and gentle summer rain, so I 
don't think we'll be seeing any sort of uprising from the General 
Populace any time soon.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr:  police rape (without penetration) victim

Yea, well unfortunately the media is filled with stories like this.   
The other day I watched a video where a quadriplegic man being booked  
into a jail was dumped out of the chair on the ground because  
apparently the deputy didn't believe he was disabled, then you see  
the deputy laughing at him.  They must feed the demons.  Couple this  
with the numerous videos we've all seen of people getting tased and  
other stories of abuse like the rape rooms set up in some of the  
Texas youth facilities.  And people don't want to believe this stuff  
because they naively believe that because they would never do  
something like this that it must not be true.

I don't really know what else to say about it except that I hope this  
never happens to one of our fellow ravers, obviously it would be  
better if it happened to no one at all, but we are now bearing the  
generational fruits of the public not keeping a close enough eye on  
what the government is doing.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: next step - MARTIAL LAW!

Yea but be careful about being so closed minded to religion.  I  
looked at the article that Nyc posted, one of them the link didn't  
work by the way, but the one that did from AFP I don't know what to  
make of it, except that I don't see how to bridge the gap between  
feeling strongly about one's religion and hijacking a nuclear bomber  
to start world war 4.  That's a pretty big jump in my opinion and  
also it fits in nicely with the watch out for blond haired blue eyed  
Al Qaeda running around the US propaganda currently being distributed  
to all the TV viewers.  They've got to keep people constantly scared  
in order to keep this reign of terror going, and the second people  
wake up, I think it's going to collapse of its own weight.

Now the reason i say be careful about religion is there are documents  
out there that talk about the New World Order's master plan is to  
have a godless society where you worship the state, just like 1984.   
I'm not joking.  One of the only things holding them back is we've  
got 160 million gun owners in this country.  They want to destroy the  
family and have a one child policy and even destroy the individual.   
Strong families with religious convictions stand in the way of those  
plans.  I mean, it's fine if you want to be an athiest, i know a few,  
just try not to shut out what some of them are saying because some of  
it is valuable information.  It's your job as a consumer of this  
information to sort out what you think is correct and what is  
hogwash.  That's why discussion is so important, too!

By the way, in doing some research, i found out that Gore Vidal  
attended Timothy McVeigh's execution.  he was invited by Timothy  
McVeigh himself.  Anyone know about this?

I'm not arguing for universal ID, but actually if you want to prevent identity theft strong universal biometric ID documents would be one way to do it.  

You can't steal an identity if you can't produce false identity documents such as driver's licenses.  

Full disclosure: my employer makes products for the prevention of identity theft and identity fraud

People interested in issues of privacy and reputation should read this book: http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Future-of-Reputation/index.htm

Its a very important book IMO and it will change some of your views about privacy on the Internet. 

As usual YMMV

Best,

Peter

No - but maybe when they implement the "universal card" with ID, bank info, 
etc. on it - and people's identities are stolen left and right, and our 
rights are all but decimated (as is slowly happening already), and the 
Middle class has been eliminated (also happening) - people might finally get 
a little mad...maybe.

If the McDonald's doesn't just render everyone slothlike and

"Detox: Day 7"

Perhaps someone out there feels my pain!?!?!

I would have to believe cigarettes are like crack. I read the reason they're so addictive is because they can work as a stimulant OR a depressant. That kind of makes sense to me because I smoked in the morning to help me wake up, and took smoke "breaks" to chill when I'm busy on something. 

In the morning? After a shag? After a meal? At the club? During a long phone call? When I'm bored?

Holy crap, I guess I smoked a lot. It has been 13 years since I started smoking "full time." 

I want to know how the ex-smokers on here cope. Yeah, I have patches, lozenges, and gum. I don't really have a method for administration other than that I've found I need something all the f11ck!ng time! 

That, and my feet itch. Maybe Shermans do have crack in them, wouldn't surprise me. 

Discuss.

I feel your pain Chuck.

I smoked a pack and a half a day for about 7 years. Quit cold turkey NYE
1999. I was serious though -- I put my last butt out on the back of my
hand as a reminder. (my grandfather succumbed to lung cancer in 1992 --
his poison was "Prince Albert in a can"). Quitting smoking was one of
the HARDEST things I have ever had to do. I gave it a kickstart by
locking myself up in my house for the first 3 weeks... but most normal
people won't have that luxury.

I'm sorry to say... but you're not even CLOSE to being out of the woods.
In the next 3 weeks, you will become irritable, shaky, and experience
PMS-style mood swings. I had an emotional breakdown 3 weeks in because I
was mortally afraid of a little dental work! Looking back on it now it
sounds totally stupid, but I wanted a smoke so bad I might have killed
someone.=20

It gets easier over time, of course. For me, after about 6 weeks they
started to noticeably subside... but the cravings never completely went
away. Even now, and more often than I'd like to admit, there are times
where I think to myself "damn I could use a smoke". Instead, I walk. I
turn on my PS2. I breathe deep. I jerk it. Or I simply try to think
about something else.=20

Best advice I can give is this: know thyself and thy stress triggers.
Instead of a smoke break, walk around the block once or twice. Try to
surround yourself with some cool people that do NOT smoke (I know that's
a lot easier said than done). Join a gym, and actually go... or be
prepared to gain some weight. When you feel the stress creeping up, take
a deep breath, hold it... and slowly exhale. It helps.

Good luck bro. If you make it past the two month mark you will be well
over the worst of it, and you'll be in the minority... and you'll feel a
lot better.

I think you turn the corner when you begin to realize the benefits of  
not smoking, and actually feel better. The longer you go without  
smoking, the more inertia you'll have to stay quit. If you turn that  
corner...

I quit for 2 years, now I smoke about 5-10 a week. More when I party.  
I'd say that's still too much. The difference between 1 and 5 cigs is  
probably not that much to your lungs. The first one does most of the  
damage.

I feel so lucky - I quit cold turkey and never had any withdrawal symptoms.

Oddly, it's been since like '00 that I quit, and I get mroe cravings in the 
last year than i have since I quit!

Mainly just after a good meal, good sex or whilst partying though. hehe

I feel pretty lucky too because I've always been able to just quit,  
like I'll just lose interest and stop completely.  Ways I reduce  
smoking are I roll my own, I don't smoke in the house, I never smoke  
in the car, which are good things anyway because you don't want that  
smell around, and I only really smoke when I have time to actually  
enjoy the cigarette.  That leaves me time for about 1-2 a day, maybe  
3 or 4 if I'm thinking a lot.

Contrast that to one of my friends, who knows I don't allow smoking  
in the car, so whenever we go places and I'm driving, light up one  
the second we get out of the car, so have to wait before going in the  
building, and then have to wait for him to finish the other one  
before we get in the car.  To me, that's not enjoying, that's just  
sucking one down for the sake of getting a rush.  Why bother?

Nobody knows how to run the economy. Not even Greenspan.

That's his point, I think is the economy doesn't need "running", it  
runs itself.  And when you mess with it, it has bad results, the  
lower down the food chain, the worse it gets.

I think it was Greenspan who likened economic policy to driving a car down
a tunnel while blindfolded.  When you hit a wall, you swerve the other way,
until you hit the other wall and swerve back...

In a phrase, one craving at a time.  The urge never goes away, you just
get used to it.  3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months, 3 years, you still sometimes
get hit with a powerful urge.  Maybe you lie to yourself and decide on
"just one more," or maybe you manage to decide "nah, I can hold off for
now."

if your feet are itching too, go for a walk; kill 2 with 1. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ Shadow & Cut Chemist: The Hard Sell (last night)

I find this interesting, as there are completely different reviews on 
another list.  I'll include one here:

I went to the same DJ Shadow/Cut Chemist tour a few days ago too and 
thought exactly the same thing. Those guys are such sick producers and 
certainly capable technically, it was incredible that with their looping 
pedals and 8 decks that they only conjured up extremely simple loops and 
the aforementioned mashups.  No transcendence whatsoever, not even 
danceable grooves.  Either go for one or the other.  Blow me away or 
make me shake my ass.  And, preferably, do both.  I really hate going to 
"techno" events that are basically digital-ass tech house for, like, 6 
hours in a row with no dynamics and Ableton Live ping pong delays and 
occasional bass dropouts.  Where did the darkness and the soul and the 
emotion and the groove and the percussion go?

Sorry, I got wound up again about minimal fucking "techno".

- C

This was in response to this review:

I went to go see DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist "The Hard Sell" a few days 
ago.

I left wondering how two DJs with such huge record collections and all 
the time in the world to program a set could come up with a set that was 
about as creative as hearing Joe Random DJ play mashups. Oh boy, that 
"Gilligan's Island" cover set to the music of Stairway To Heaven.. which 
someone at work sent me as a mp3 two years ago. Yawn. I think basically 
we're in the transitionary period where music globalizes.. and the old 
rules for DJs are changing..

Does that answer your question?

HA!

Oddly, when I saw Cut Chemist at 1015 last year (or was it 2k6?) he was off 
the heezy....surprised to hear the two of them together weren't 
more...um....I dunno "more"? lol

Also funny to hear you go off on the minimal thing. I love some of it, but 
totally agree with hearing DJ's who don't layer and build it like minimal is 
meant to do. You can make minimal sets extremely emotive and grooving if you 
try hard enough.

Oh yea - saw your Freecycle posts JC...I almost responded just for shits and 
giggles, hehe.

In the end, I guess you had to be there. . . Megan & I danced (where we could find room, as the venue was sold out).

Guess whoever wrote the first review has already mastered mixing & scratching 45's on 8 decks. . . And man, would I love to see THEIR vinyl collection.

The parallel they attempt to illustrate between The Hard Sell and a "techno" event, along with the use of Ableton, is tragic at best.

Sorry, I got wound up again about minimal fucking "techno".

This was in response to this review:

I went to go see DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist "The Hard Sell" a few days 
ago.

I left wondering how two DJs with such huge record collections and all 
the time in the world to program a set could come up with a set that was 
about as creative as hearing Joe Random DJ play mashups. Oh boy, that 
"Gilligan's Island" cover set to the music of Stairway To Heaven.. which 
someone at work sent me as a mp3 two years ago. Yawn. I think basically 
we're in the transitionary period where music globalizes.. and the old 
rules for DJs are changing..

Does that answer your question?

Sorry, but the reviews weren't mine.  I was just forwarding them from 
another list, since I saw the night and day contrasts in reviews to be 
fairly interesting.  (Obviously, perspective is completely subjective.)

LOL.  Wasn't trying to make anyone grumpy!  Just was interested, in a 
sorta sociological way I suppose, in the contrast of opinions.

It's too damn nice to be grumpy!  Now leave work early and get out and 
enjoy the day! :)

Not sure he's really a nazi or a racist so much as an isolationist.

Guess it depends, do you think of Randy Weaver or Nation of Islam,
both of whom advocated isolationism, as a nazi or a nazi movement?

I do think isolationism is a flawed philosophical base, but ultimately
a hands-off dork like Ron Paul is less dangerous than a hands-on
activist who's sure you need fixing.

Ron Paul needs to take a dirt nap. Anyone who can't manage to get along with 
people of other colors, whether they are "isolationist" or "racist" are 
sub-human pieces of shit.

But I fully endorse their right to live and breathe amongst us humans, lol.

J.C.:

Point well taken, as always. I'm not surprised at some of the criticism from the "stand-by-the-dj-with-your-arms-folded-for-the-whole-set" types, especially on a subjective level, however I do not recant my praise of the show.

BTW, being grumpy is g.r.a.t.e. 

There! That's the first time ever, in the history of ever, I used the word grate. And it feels grate. Who the hell came up with grate anyways? Sounds very second-generation. SFR modern history lesson please.

Obliged (and still pretty grumpy),

Chuck

LOL.  Wasn't trying to make anyone grumpy!  Just was interested, in a 
sorta sociological way I suppose, in the contrast of opinions.

It's too damn nice to be grumpy!  Now leave work early and get out and 
enjoy the day! :)

I quit three years ago.  Before I quit I was healthy, happy and
well-exercised.  After I quit it was one serious medical problem after
another.  Seriously.  I still have a desire for cigs and I keep a pack in
the drawer just in case:-)

I used Wellbutrin and gum to quit. I liked the rush although some find that
drug disturbing.  To replace the nicotene stimulant effect I drink lots of
coffee.

there's only one fitting word for greenspan, sell-out.  he used to  
write articles criticizing the fed back in the 60's and then went to  
one of those bohemian grove trilateral things and suddenly he shut up  
about all that.  everything is a conspiracy.  the moon landing was  
faked.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Quiting Smoking (cigarettes)

Those that know me personally know that I can smoke like a 
chimney at times. A few that know me better, know that I've been 
really trying to quit over the last year and a 1/2.

After a few failed attempts, I learned to go cold 
turkey. The patch gave me annoying nightmares, and in the end 
you're still paying money for something you're hooked on 
(patches, gum). My longest non-smoking run recently was about 5 
months, with a bunch of 2-5 week runs interspersed as well in the last 1.5 
years. Right now I'm going on 2 weeks again.

I know I'm not completely successful, but the success I do have 
is attributed to distraction and exercise. I find the more 
things I distract myself with, the less time I have to think 
about it, the less it becomes an issue.

Sometimes I hang out at this forum too: http://www.quitnet.com. 
It's a really oddball community but they're really nice 
and pretty active. That's a good distraction to start out with.

Good luck Chuck, we're in the same boat! We live close, hit me 
up :-)

How about no bitchy posts about content. Instead, inject the content  
you want to see.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Sad day on SFR... ok, so let's post something
 different.

interestingly enough, this is a NRR thread.. about being anti NRR on SFR.

 in regards to pinkko, i'd rather be on the no posts at all side of 
things myself. it keeps me from trudging through a mountain of mail and 
replies like 'ha-ha i'm smart.'

if anybody is fiending for topics to post about, here's a few:

what's your party pick for this weekend?
what's your favorite record of the moment?
did you hear a murmering of that party at that underground space? 
(uberzone is playing somewhere soon btw)
where do you see the future of the rave scene?
what happened to 'the future' in the rave scene. specifically why don't 
we hear tracks telling us like eskimos & egypt did with their track 
"welcome to the future"
how do you feel about the reprise of italo disco coming back like an 
endearing yet, cheesy homo-erotic phoenix from the ashes?
or my favorite, hey let's throw a party just for the hell of it and its 
free and everyone can come.. its sunny out. byob and veggie dogs!!

shit like this is real shit. if the NRRs build up we'll become like the 
land of the lost ravers in the socal raves list. where nary a word 
called rave is ever heard. and maybe possibly SFR would be in danger of 
becoming irrelevant (if it already hasn't).

of course NRRs that benefit ravers are welcome. philip's job wanted 
posting is a good example.

ok i done my bit.

peace and love,
sean.

Um, actually I work about 50-60 hours a week and manage to keep myself

"(uberzone is playing somewhere soon btw)"

I once saw Uberzone play an anthem trance remix of Jingle Bells. While I was
candyflipping. That ought to be a crime punishable by death.

I mean, Jingle Bells?

Really?

Yeah, quitting is a bitch and a half. My record is about a month, I smoke
about a pack a day. Exercise helps tremendously. It's a lot easier to not
smoke if you want your lungs to be okay for the mile you run in the
mornings.

You're telling someone on a rave mailing list that their brain is fried. . .


Isn't that a bit repetitive?

Trust me, if you knew Brian for a long time, you'll not take anything he 
says to heart.  Why do I have such a laundry list of dirt on people?  Am I

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Quitting Smoking (cigarettes)

yeah, I think I shared my wellbutrin story with Apollo.  Fucked my 
ass up.  I had to leave work, I was so sick and disoriented, I 
couldn't function.. but I also couldn't drive anywhere.. so I just 
lay in my car for hours until I felt well enough to drive home.  I 
was dizzy, nauseous, hallucinating, lost stereoscopicity, easily the 
2nd worst drug reaction I've had.  I've gotten alcohol poisoning 
twice - that takes the cake.  3rd's Oxycontin.  That made me puke for 
3 hours straight, but at least I could see.

Sorry Nico, for once, I agree with assho err I mean pinkko.  I'm 
neither bored nor unemployed - I'm reading SFR for the first time in 
several days.

BTW pinkko, I really enjoy your nicotine withdrawal mix.  A lot of 
great dj's are assholes, so it actually works..

My brain is just fine, thank you very much.

If I'm reading you right, then you're saying that the RAVE Act II did 
nothing to suppress the growth of Rave Culture in the USA, that it just 
collapsed, and went away on its own accord?

Not because party promoters might scared that if their venue gets busted 
that they'd be looking at losing that night's gate, a $250K fine, and 
having to serve a sentence of 10 years in a Federal, (no time off for 
good behavior) Super-Max Gulag if they get convicted?

And Rave is really good for nothing else, and serves no other purpose, 
other than to be used as background music to sell Stupid Ugly Vehicles?

That's gotta be good news for Moby, and other artists, since they 
doesn't have to worry about lost revenue streams from all the shows they 
aren't doing because it's against the law.

And acts like Daft Punk should just be grateful that a Kanye deigns to 
use their shit, instead of them being bigger than he is?

Is that right?

If it isn't, then how is the Rave Act II any less draconian then some of 
the Federal/State/Local War on Drugs legislation that is out there?

Subject: [sfraves] Recent Music was: NRR: Sad day on SFR... 

I listen to U-Gene's monthly mixes.. they're often good, but I think 
I've listened to 26 more than any of the others.  I ended up 
downloading a bunch of the artists, like Electric 6 and The 
Wombats.  For  awhile I'd stop the mix when I got to Green Velvet, 
because I don't like that track.. but then I didn't know about the 
Dragonette which comes later.  That's a pretty sick track.  I'd buy that.

You're kidding right?!  They're smarter, on average, than both our

No, I'm saying that the people that like Kanye aren't ravers to begin with.

And, raves aren't dead.  Maybe they are in your neck of the woods, 
but not here.

ps we agree that the legislation sucks, we disagree about how effective it is.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Sad day on SFR

Well I don't mean to be snobby but I haven't really found anything  
that makes me want to go out lately.  I've got a couple on the  
calendar but they're not raves, I am not convinced they exist anymore  
thanks to government intervention has the rave in detention//

dictionary please, someone please describe the 2008 description of a  
'rave'.

Don't worry, though, I'm still convinced raves will be the one to  
save the world from imminent destruction.  All we need are the  
correct sequence and variable intensity of events.

*************************************************************

This week /// 15 February, 2008 /// 9pm-1am Pacific Standard Time ///
http://www.zer01.net:1200/

it's SUCKA FREE techno night with the sounds of::

->DJ Alex Windsor

Originally from London, Alex has been instrumental in the San Francisco
Techno (with a capital T) scene since 1992 as a partner in the Gaia Mantra
Record store in SF and as a promoter and resident of techno weekly MAD
Mondays in the mid 90s. Alex's skills have taken him all across the globe,
from the US to Japan and the UK. He has played alongside the likes of Aphex
Twin, the Shamen, Orbital, Carl Craig, Richie Hawtin, Moby, Mr.C, Juan
Atkins, Mark Broom, & Dave Clarke just to name a few.... He's played at
parties here in SF run by such infamous crews as Friends & Family, Harmony,
Area 51, Tribal Future, Gateway, Brass Tax , Future, and countless
undergrounds and one-offs.

->DJ Perla
http://www.myspace.com/perladanceusted

Perla has appeared on Radio Integrated before and totally rocked it with his
own live material. Perla originally hails from Southern Spain, where he
helped promote his Dance Usted parties or, 'Dance Please'.  As bulletproof
and flawless as his original tracks are, his selection skills are equally
unbeatable. We are pleased to welcome Perla back this time for a special
Ableton Live DJ Set.

http://www.zer01.net:1200/

Every Friday from 9pm - 1AM PST

Upcoming Radio Integrated shows ///

*22 February//  Taking a little break from the techno (gasp!) to bring you
ILL-Ectro night featuring DJs Indigo and Sheztek, dropping all electro sets.
Note: 'Doing the robot' is forbidden... unless you're calling it 'locking
and poppin', then it's OK.

*29 February// Broadcasting live from brand new techno weekly Faktion at Anu
in San Francisco, with DJ Developer (Los Angeles) and local SF deep techno
producer Endosine (Live P.A.) Come in and have a drink with us at Anu if
you're in town, otherwise tune in to Radio Integrated and be there in
spirit. ;)

*7 March//  Keeping it real with DJs Clarity and Caltrop. Clarity is a
longtime SF techno favorite who played some records at the very first DEF
event, and we are stoked to welcome her back. A former resident of SF
electro club Tokyo Electric, Caltrop is an eclectic and creative DJ who
always keeps it groovin' with his mix of minimal, electro, house, disco,
acid, from the old school to the new school.

Check it out!

You're kidding right?!  They're smarter, on average, than both our 
IQ's combined.  Being that smart makes them crazy and irrational.. 
but they're definitely smart.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Quiting Smoking (cigarettes)

That's how a friend of mine quit smoking.  His epiphany was not about  
his smoking, but about his weight.  After his father had a heart  
attack, he realized he was seriously overweight too and possibly  
headed towards a coronary himself.  So he decided to get in shape.   
And the goal he set for himself was to be able to run a marathon (not  
necessarily competitively, just to be able to do it).

Smoking was interfering with his running, so one day he just decided  
that the running was more important to him; and he quit... cold  
turkey... and never smoked again, not even pot.


cya,
john

 different.

haha actually i lost track of uberzone after they left city of angels 
records.. i assumed they were still ok. although that bambaataa track 
they did sucked even with bambaataa on it. i see what you mean. i'd 
think it would be genius to play a trance remix of jingle bells during 
the hottest day of summer. just for the sheer audacity of it and cheese 
factor.

If u are referring to the track "2 Kool 4 Skool" that they did w/ Bambaataa=
....I dunno, that is one of the most classic breaks tracks in my collection=

>From another list:

[Beat Randy to the punch.] Its not as hard as it used to be for
peeps to quit cigarettes these days given the treatments out there.
Both my sister and my wife quit successfully doing the following:

Month One: Day One - Start Wellbutrin regimin, continue to smoke
Month One: Day 15 - Start wearing nicotine patch, continue to smoke
Month Two Day 1 - Quit smoking
Month Two Day 15 - Quit patch
Month Three Day 1 - Quit Wellbutrin

The ramp off the patch and the medicine can happen faster or more
slowly as required. Both said the combo really reduced the
withdrawals symptoms. My proof came when my wife successfully quit
and we didn't have a single argument the following 2 weeks (which
ALWAYS happened when she had unsuccessfully tried to quit prior.)

bummer.

hopefully they'll keep working on it and come out with newer better

Kudos Shawn...I know yer not on SFR, but someone appreciates your art ;)

Enjoy the listen kids.

So I think I've probably already mentioned my Italo-disco side project to
some of you....

My electronic neo-disco band Easystreet is playing at Milk (1840 Haight @
Stanyan) this Thursday evening, and I would love to see some raver friends
there!  I play my blinky table of electronic boxes, and my partner Michael
Blitzen sings and dances and touches people.  Easystreet shows are generally
a very colorful and reasonably ridiculous affair.

You can hear some of Easystreet's joyfully dancing smile musics at
www.myspace.com/sexyeasystreet

We are on first, at approximately 8:30. Cover is $5.  There will be a smoke
machine.  Come come!!

Love Chelsea

Subject: [sfraves] YOU MUST SEE THIS - Re: [sfraves] BSP - Easystreet at Milk in SF this Thurday, 2/21/08. Sparkly disco for you.

I haven't seen Easystreet live but I can vouch that their music has made me smile wider than just about anything of late (GO TO THE MYSPACE, LISTEN!).

The live show promises to be that and so much more- A quote from a live recording on Myspace: (cue hilarious accent)

"Theese song was a hit in Europe in 1995!  You will not know it because it never came out to the USA!  But it is not old, it is ready for you noww!!!"

Anyway, I will be there, and you owe it to yourself to do the same.  Get there early!

/gush,

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Easystreet at Milk in SF this Thurday, 2/21/08. Sparkly disco for you.

So I think I've probably already mentioned my Italo-disco side project to
some of you....

My electronic neo-disco band Easystreet is playing at Milk (1840 Haight @
Stanyan) this Thursday evening, and I would love to see some raver friends
there!  I play my blinky table of electronic boxes, and my partner Michael
Blitzen sings and dances and touches people.  Easystreet shows are generally
a very colorful and reasonably ridiculous affair.

You can hear some of Easystreet's joyfully dancing smile musics at
www.myspace.com/sexyeasystreet

We are on first, at approximately 8:30. Cover is $5.  There will be a smoke
machine.  Come come!!

Love Chelsea

We aim to make the smiling joy of the dancing people be happiness and sexy!

 Sparkly disco for you.

yeah, easy street is fun. it may sound like cheesy italo disco schlock 
to the uninitiated, but if you are in on the joke, its fucking amazing. 
it's very well done cheese, maybe comparable to the refined taste of an 
aged Camembert.

as easy street would say in their 'easy speak',

"the easy street is here to make the world to dance!! therefore, here 
they go world!"

fluoro attire is welcome!

Damn guy, who pissed in your cheerios? I'm actually a web developer and I
became so with little more than a GED and balls, so I didn't need college to
get a job where I wasn't breaking my back. Perhaps your higher education was
wasted? Regardless, like everyone else I get downtime, which is no
indication whatsoever of my work ethic. Maybe it's the East
Coaster/Southerner in me, but what the fuck is the point of having friends
if you can't hurl insults at them constantly?

Srsly u guys.

U guys.

Srsly.

We did indeed play before this gentleman that night...and DDR himself gave 
us a myriad of compliments, to which I was quite surprised (and pleased) 
about!

I was faded as hell after his set though, good god....

DDR rocked.  

Heather played after the Mario Brothers.  The bass was banging it so hard during her set that I had to retreat...

I'm not worthy. ;)

I get the impression from a lot of people that know the Illuminati is =20
a real deal that they have a defeatist attitude, that we might as well =20
just lay down and let it happen.  Or they're just used to being =20
cynical about things and have been that way for so long, maybe they =20
don't realize they now are not looking for solutions to problems, just =20
looking for more things to complain about.  I know I get that way =20
sometimes as well.  I am here to say today, that is a trap.  And not =20
doing anything about it in this case I think is more dangerous than =20
opening our mouths and saying no when we can, or taking action where =20
we will have an effect.

I'll stop there because then I have to start getting specific and I'll =20
be here all morning.  I want to leave for school this morning, I've =20
got to do my dialogue from Gore Vidal's play, "An Evening with Richard =20
Nixon".  Yep, I'm playing Tricky Dick!  I am not a crook.

Fuuny thing that this is Grooverider. He got me back into BUZZ one night 
when I got kicked out for selling pills cuz he wanted to buy pills off of 
me, lol.

Apparently he likes to party, and apparently Dubai is not the spot to get 
jiggy like that,

with a four-year jail sentence. This includes legal, prescribed drugs for 
health conditions (examples include codeine and similar narcotic-like drugs

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: DJ Grooverider jailed in Dubai

Jesus christ...  Is the urge to smoke out SO STRONG that he's gotta bring the shit on A PLANE?!?!  Not even factoring in all the very publicized press about Dubai's' insane drug policies?

Honestly, you're a globetrotting, superstar DJ, probably traveling to some gigs.  If the promoters throwing "MECHA-RAVEEEY DUBAI!!!!11!!! 2008" can't get you a little doja, they're not worth their weight in fliers.

Sucks for him, I've always dug his stuff,

Goldie (Metalheadz, UK)
In his own words:

Hey you blokes. My name is Goldie, and I represent that pure raw UK drum
and bass sound. My main goals in life include: making sick drum and bass
tracks that come off as crazy dance floor monsters (regardless if they all
sound the same), clipping mixers untill those red lights light up to the
top, destroying high end sound systems around the world, making peopls
eardrums explode, and trying to accomplish putting on all my gold
accessories in under 30 minutes time.

By 1991, Goldie had become fascinated by the British breakbeat music
scene; and his girlfriend, DJ Kemistry, introduced him to the pioneering
jungle/drum'n'bass producers Dennis 'Dego' McFarlane and Mark 'Marc Mac'
Clair, known as 4hero.  His first globally released album, Timeless,
followed in 1995. Timeless shot straight into the charts at number seven,
which was a first for a drum 'n' bass record.  In 2002, Goldie said that
he had been working for three years on a film called Sine Tempus,
described as a coming-of-age story of a young paintbrush artist, and in
2006 announced its soundtrack as his new album. As of 2008, album and film
have not been released yet.  Goldie is also known for his work as the
leader of the Rufige Kru. This group has no fixed members; it has included
some of most well-known drum and bass producers such as Technical Itch,
Heist, Teebee, Cujo, Agzilla Da Ice, Doc Scott and Rob Playford.

Evil Breaks & False Profit present:
DIRTY

Friday, February 22nd, 2008
DNA Lounge (375 11th st.)

$10 presales available here:
(http://groovetickets.com/ordersystem/groove/eventviewqb.asp?AffilID=93&EventsID=36367&PGname=Evil%20Breaks)

$10 b4 11pm/$15 after that
10pm - 4am??
21+ w/ID


I know a bunch of people were expecting a show from us in January, but
instead of pushing forward with a show that just wasn't quite right, we
decided to move it to February. So here we are, coming at you with a show
that we KNOW will deliver. We're teaming up with False Profit for this
one, and along with the 2 UK headliners and a stellar local lineup, this
is really one you can't afford to miss.

AMB
(Chi-Recordings/Sinister/Money Shot/Audio Therapy/EQ) - UK

Based in London, but with roots in Hungarys Chi Recordings, Ambrus Deak
a.k.a. AMB, has been in music production, engineering, and label
management for over seven years.

Co-founder and a fundamental cog in Chi Recordings, he also appears on
Reacts 21st Century Breaks, Distinctives Y4K, EQ Recordings, and Dave
Saemans Audio Therapy. AMB was responsible for one of the most remarkable
breakbeat tracks of 2002, Romeo, which obtained second place on
Breakspoll, The International Breakbeat Awards, best single category in
2003. Support comes from Hybrid, Nick Warren, Roger Sanchez, James Zabiela
, Laurent Garnier, Elite Force, Chris Carter, Plump DJs, Terminalhead,
Meat Katie, Tayo, General Midi, Hyper, and many more. AMB is supported by
todays leading international provider of digital audio and MIDI
solutions, M-Audio. And when hes not making music or spinning records, he
puts on his mastering suit, or makes soundtracks for commercials, theatre
and the film industry.

As a DJ he has played in the USA, UK, France, Germany, Russia, Croatia,
Serbia, Hungary alongside The Chemical Brothers, Adam Freeland, Hybrid,
Chris Carter, Elite Force, General Midi, and a whole lot more.

Diverted
(Diverted Traffic/TCR/Sokolov Sounds/Mofo/ibreaks) - UK

DIVERTED are DJ/Producers and Label Owners Stephen Baxter and Lee
Richardson. They have produced a string of well received releases on
Sokolov Sounds, TCR and AIR which helped them find their grounding in the
breaks scene. This has also spurred the guys on to creating their album
which is being put together hand-in-hand with an exciting live show
involving vocalists, live instruments from the guys themselves and
contributions from other Djs and artists around them including Nine Lives
the Cat. Check out their myspace page for regular updates, videos, gig
schedule and news as this album takes shape.

The last year has taken them all around the world Djing their sound to the
masses. Particularly memorable nights have been at the infamous HUM
events, Drop Beats Not Bombs, Chew the Fat @ The End, Breakspoll @ Fabric,
Glade Festival and tours of Australia and Russia saw appreciation for the
boys outside the UK.

 Along with E.B. residents:
Carbon Community
(Sober Music/Bless Records/Moonshine/E.B.) - SF
Aaron Jae (E.B./Space Cowboys)
Bam (E.B./Invibe)
M.O.D. (E.B.)

False Profit upstairs:
Dr. Toast (FP)
Alxndr (Downlow/FP/Transported SF)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Tonal's 1 Year Anniversary this Saturday!

One year ago we set out to put a new mark on the San Francisco scene with a
series of color themed parties by the name of Tonal that would feature our
favorite DJs from across the world.  After enlisting the help and input of
many of our friends and family, we decided to kick things off with what
turned into an insane underground featuring Q-Burns Abstract Message.  With
double the turnout we planned for and so many people dressed up in that
party's theme of Electric Blue, we knew we were on to something.

A full year later, looking back at what has been an epic run of events, we
decided it was time to bring back the blue theme for our One Year
Anniversary!  After a year that featured Justin Long and Shamrock Green,
Miles Maeda and Fire Engine Red, Matt e Starr and Pimpin' Purple, Troydon
and Poppin' Pink, Jay Tripwire and Groovin' Gold, Jeno and Fade to Black,
and finally Diz and Clockwork Orange, it's time for Midnight Blue with DJ
Fame!

Saturday, February 23rd

Rock It Science & Prismatic present

Tonal: Midnight Blue

DJ Fame (New York - Dubsided, Potty Mouth)

Tonal is very excited to welcome one of the most cutting edge DJ/producers
to emerge in recent years!  The only US artist with an EP on Dubsided, the

the globe, to his 4 year residency at New York's premier underground venue,
Sullivan Room, Fame has brought the more jackin' sounds of tech house and
electro to crowds of thousands across the world. A veteran with over a
decade on the decks, Fame's energetic performances showcase serious
technical ability combined with intense cuts, crazy loops, and other
turntablist tricks to bring a truly unique sound to the dance floor.

Subject: [sfraves] funniest track evar!  (or at least today)

Just happened to hear DJ Armando drop Jose Nunez' "Bilingual" this afternoon on XM...

OK, this track is a few years old but it still makes me chuckle.

"You fucking me makes me bilingual "

What do you guys think?  Quoting Adriana ... /discuss

I think it was the Great Depression and the New Deal, that broke the
connection of the American people with the Founding Fathers.  The
Founding Fathers had always taught that your own government is your
own worst enemy, it's the only one that can have real power over you.
Foreign invaders are not ever the threat of your own government, so
that's why they tied the government down with the Constitution, the
Bill of Rights, the seperation of powers and checks and balances and
all that.  And that was taught until the Great Depression, and then
Roosevelt came along and said that was all backwards, the government
is your protector, we're going to protect you, we're going to rescue
you, from the recession that the Federal Reserve caused.  And ever
since then, Americans have been taught to look to the government for
protection.

I'll respond to this with a quote from none other than the Immortal
Technique:

"but you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
when niggaz speculate what the fuck 'Pac would say
you don't know shit, about a dead mans perspective"

Same principle applies here.

I have sympathy for Mr. Roosevelt, because he marches straight toward
his objectives over Congress, lobbies and bureaucracy.

I still am a bit of a prude about putting glitter all over myself,  
and the German singer was making me a little nervous with the  
microphone, I was trying to make sure I didn't do a Chevy Chase and  
trip over the cord, but hey it's all good it even had me jumping  
around like a little girl I could care less what people think.  My  
only other issue was the show didn't seem long enough, though I  
wasn't the one singing, so I can't really say I would last half that  
long.  Maybe I'll get up and sing for you guys when Peter takes his  
shirt off for everyone.

[ K O N T R O L ]


minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup



featuring from New York City:


DEREK PLASLAIKO  ( Spectral Sound . The Bunker )

Derek Plaslaiko doesn't make records, but he sure as hell
knows how to play 'em.  One of a select few to have made
a name for himself based on DJ skills alone, Derek's
dedication and immense musical knowledge, coupled with his
anything-goes attitude make every set a memorable dance
floor experience.  Once a prominent figure on the Detroit
party scene, he relocated to NYC a few years back and was
soon crowned "Best Techno DJ" by the Village Voice.  We
simply call him "The Man", and are excited to welcome him
back for an extended encore performance.



and San Francisco's own:


CLAUDE VONSTROKE  ( Mothership . Dirtybird )

The last time our friend Barclay Crenshaw played for us,
just a couple short years ago in August '05, it was one of
the first times his pseudonym Claude VonStroke had
appeared in print on a flyer.  My how times change!  Now a
bona fide international superstar synonymous with the new
sound of SF, the inimitable 'Stroker returns to [KONTROL]
to lay down a specially crafted techno set you won't hear
anywhere else.



with [KONTROL] residents:


CRAIG KUNA  ( Platform . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO  ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )
NIKOLA BAYTALA  ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )
SAMMY D  ( Dirtybird . Utensil )

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper int=
o
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends, forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that make
the staunchest of chin-stroking, note-taking trainspotters lose their shit
on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. H=
e
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties=
.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  Wit=
h
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during tha=
t
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to hea=
d
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs a=
t
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lam=
b
monthly parties. More recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

The last time Derek played for [KONTROL] in February '07, he so thouroughly
impressed both the crowd and our resident DJs that we have been drooling
over the day we would have him back, and we're happy to report that day has
come. This time Derek comes to us as part of the "Death Is Nothing To Fear"
Spectral Residencies, on his first major US tour.

CLAUDE VONSTROKE

"I would like to come over=85what are you having for dinner?" asks the cree=
py
character in Claude VonStroke's first hit record, "Deep Throat."  After
selling through 10 pressings in 2005, "Deep Throat" quickly put VonStroke o=
n
the map as an up and coming artist.  The success of the single was followed
up by "Who's Afraid of Detroit?," another international hit championed by
Richie Hawtin who called it the "Best Track of 2006" in DJ magazine.  Soon
after he released his full length debut album, "Beware of the Bird" to
excellent reviews, further establishing him as an original talent in the
world of underground dance music. Since then, Claude has done remixes for a
very diverse group of top artists ranging all the way from indie-rock band
The Rapture, to electro legends Newcleus, to minimalists like Matt Tolfrey
and Jeff Samuel.

Claude VonStroke is better known to locals as Barclay Crenshaw, the owner o=
f
San Francisco's quirky tech-funk label, dirtybird.  The label consists of
Crenshaw (VonStroke,) friends and fellow producers Justin Martin, Christian
Martin, and Worthy, and a diverse assortment of top remixers from around th=
e
globe including John Tejada, Audion, Diplo, 3 Channels, Dj Assault, and
Kevin Saunderson.

The idea for dirtybird began in 2003 when Crenshaw was producing an intense
5 hour DVD about electronic music called, "Intellect." The project was a
labor of love, taking almost 2 years to complete and starring over 35 top
producers and legendary DJs such as Derrick May, Swayzak, Derrick Carter,
Deep Dish, Magda, Theo Parish, and many more.  The main goal of the
"Intellect" project was to make an informative DVD that could help DJs
advance their careers in electronic music. The result was Crenshaw himself
starting dirtybird records and a production career under the alias Claude
VonStroke.

Since 2005, dirtybird has managed to solidify a reputation for releasing
oddball classic techno and house tracks, and in the process has become one
of the hottest labels on the planet. The outdoor dirtybird parties in San
Francisco's scenic Golden Gate Park have also become a legendary summer
destination point for both locals and international travelers.

In addition to production and label management, Claude VonStroke has an
intense regimen for preparation and a great ear for song selection. His DJ
sets are always inspiring and surprising. You will never hear a set of
monotonous music because Claude always takes time to find the special cuts
that make for a completely original experience that is not to be missed.

In 2008, Claude is hard at work on his second album, in addition to
fostering his latest project, Mothership Records.  Mothership was started i=
n
2007 as VonStroke's outlet for deep and experimental techno. The first
record on Mothership became a summer classic and sold 7,000 vinyl records
and sat at #1 on the Beatport minimal techno chart for 8 weeks. Proceeds
from the label go towards children's music education in Claude's hometown o=
f
Detroit, Michigan.

Claude's special set for [KONTROL] will feature a deeper, darker techno sid=
e
of this fun-loving bear-shaped man!

[ K O N T R O L ]


minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup



featuring from New York City:


DEREK PLASLAIKO  ( Spectral Sound . The Bunker )

Derek Plaslaiko doesn't make records, but he sure as hell
knows how to play 'em.  One of a select few to have made
a name for himself based on DJ skills alone, Derek's
dedication and immense musical knowledge, coupled with his
anything-goes attitude make every set a memorable dance
floor experience.  Once a prominent figure on the Detroit
party scene, he relocated to NYC a few years back and was
soon crowned "Best Techno DJ" by the Village Voice.  We
simply call him "The Man", and are excited to welcome him
back for an extended encore performance.



and San Francisco's own:


CLAUDE VONSTROKE  ( Mothership . Dirtybird )

The last time our friend Barclay Crenshaw played for us,
just a couple short years ago in August '05, it was one of
the first times his pseudonym Claude VonStroke had
appeared in print on a flyer.  My how times change!  Now a
bona fide international superstar synonymous with the new
sound of SF, the inimitable 'Stroker returns to [KONTROL]
to lay down a specially crafted techno set you won't hear
anywhere else.



with [KONTROL] residents:


CRAIG KUNA  ( Platform . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO  ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )
NIKOLA BAYTALA  ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )
SAMMY D  ( Dirtybird . Utensil )

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper into
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends, forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that make
the staunchest of chin-stroking, note-taking trainspotters lose their shit
on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. He
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  With
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during that
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to head
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb
monthly parties. More recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

The last time Derek played for [KONTROL] in February '07, he so thouroughly
impressed both the crowd and our resident DJs that we have been drooling
over the day we would have him back, and we're happy to report that day has
come. This time Derek comes to us as part of the "Death Is Nothing To Fear"
Spectral Residencies, on his first major US tour.

CLAUDE VONSTROKE

"I would like to come overâ¦what are you having for dinner?" asks the creepy
character in Claude VonStroke's first hit record, "Deep Throat."  After
selling through 10 pressings in 2005, "Deep Throat" quickly put VonStroke on
the map as an up and coming artist.  The success of the single was followed
up by "Who's Afraid of Detroit?," another international hit championed by
Richie Hawtin who called it the "Best Track of 2006" in DJ magazine.  Soon
after he released his full length debut album, "Beware of the Bird" to
excellent reviews, further establishing him as an original talent in the
world of underground dance music. Since then, Claude has done remixes for a
very diverse group of top artists ranging all the way from indie-rock band
The Rapture, to electro legends Newcleus, to minimalists like Matt Tolfrey
and Jeff Samuel.

Claude VonStroke is better known to locals as Barclay Crenshaw, the owner of
San Francisco's quirky tech-funk label, dirtybird.  The label consists of
Crenshaw (VonStroke,) friends and fellow producers Justin Martin, Christian
Martin, and Worthy, and a diverse assortment of top remixers from around the
globe including John Tejada, Audion, Diplo, 3 Channels, Dj Assault, and
Kevin Saunderson.

The idea for dirtybird began in 2003 when Crenshaw was producing an intense
5 hour DVD about electronic music called, "Intellect." The project was a
labor of love, taking almost 2 years to complete and starring over 35 top
producers and legendary DJs such as Derrick May, Swayzak, Derrick Carter,
Deep Dish, Magda, Theo Parish, and many more.  The main goal of the
"Intellect" project was to make an informative DVD that could help DJs
advance their careers in electronic music. The result was Crenshaw himself
starting dirtybird records and a production career under the alias Claude
VonStroke.

Since 2005, dirtybird has managed to solidify a reputation for releasing
oddball classic techno and house tracks, and in the process has become one
of the hottest labels on the planet. The outdoor dirtybird parties in San
Francisco's scenic Golden Gate Park have also become a legendary summer
destination point for both locals and international travelers.

In addition to production and label management, Claude VonStroke has an
intense regimen for preparation and a great ear for song selection. His DJ
sets are always inspiring and surprising. You will never hear a set of
monotonous music because Claude always takes time to find the special cuts
that make for a completely original experience that is not to be missed.

In 2008, Claude is hard at work on his second album, in addition to
fostering his latest project, Mothership Records.  Mothership was started in
2007 as VonStroke's outlet for deep and experimental techno. The first
record on Mothership became a summer classic and sold 7,000 vinyl records
and sat at #1 on the Beatport minimal techno chart for 8 weeks. Proceeds
from the label go towards children's music education in Claude's hometown of
Detroit, Michigan.

Claude's special set for [KONTROL] will feature a deeper, darker techno side
of this fun-loving bear-shaped man!

[ K O N T R O L ]


minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup



featuring from New York City:


DEREK PLASLAIKO  ( Spectral Sound . The Bunker )

Derek Plaslaiko doesn't make records, but he sure as hell
knows how to play 'em.  One of a select few to have made
a name for himself based on DJ skills alone, Derek's
dedication and immense musical knowledge, coupled with his
anything-goes attitude make every set a memorable dance
floor experience.  Once a prominent figure on the Detroit
party scene, he relocated to NYC a few years back and was
soon crowned "Best Techno DJ" by the Village Voice.  We
simply call him "The Man", and are excited to welcome him
back for an extended encore performance.



and San Francisco's own:


CLAUDE VONSTROKE  ( Mothership . Dirtybird )

The last time our friend Barclay Crenshaw played for us,
just a couple short years ago in August '05, it was one of
the first times his pseudonym Claude VonStroke had
appeared in print on a flyer.  My how times change!  Now a
bona fide international superstar synonymous with the new
sound of SF, the inimitable 'Stroker returns to [KONTROL]
to lay down a specially crafted techno set you won't hear
anywhere else.



with [KONTROL] residents:


CRAIG KUNA  ( Platform . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO  ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )
NIKOLA BAYTALA  ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )
SAMMY D  ( Dirtybird . Utensil )

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper into
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends, forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that make
the staunchest of chin-stroking, note-taking trainspotters lose their shit
on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. He
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  With
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during that
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to head
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb
monthly parties. More recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

The last time Derek played for [KONTROL] in February '07, he so thouroughly
impressed both the crowd and our resident DJs that we have been drooling
over the day we would have him back, and we're happy to report that day has
come. This time Derek comes to us as part of the "Death Is Nothing To Fear"
Spectral Residencies, on his first major US tour.

CLAUDE VONSTROKE

"I would like to come overâ¦what are you having for dinner?" asks the creepy
character in Claude VonStroke's first hit record, "Deep Throat."  After
selling through 10 pressings in 2005, "Deep Throat" quickly put VonStroke on
the map as an up and coming artist.  The success of the single was followed
up by "Who's Afraid of Detroit?," another international hit championed by
Richie Hawtin who called it the "Best Track of 2006" in DJ magazine.  Soon
after he released his full length debut album, "Beware of the Bird" to
excellent reviews, further establishing him as an original talent in the
world of underground dance music. Since then, Claude has done remixes for a
very diverse group of top artists ranging all the way from indie-rock band
The Rapture, to electro legends Newcleus, to minimalists like Matt Tolfrey
and Jeff Samuel.

Claude VonStroke is better known to locals as Barclay Crenshaw, the owner of
San Francisco's quirky tech-funk label, dirtybird.  The label consists of
Crenshaw (VonStroke,) friends and fellow producers Justin Martin, Christian
Martin, and Worthy, and a diverse assortment of top remixers from around the
globe including John Tejada, Audion, Diplo, 3 Channels, Dj Assault, and
Kevin Saunderson.

The idea for dirtybird began in 2003 when Crenshaw was producing an intense
5 hour DVD about electronic music called, "Intellect." The project was a
labor of love, taking almost 2 years to complete and starring over 35 top
producers and legendary DJs such as Derrick May, Swayzak, Derrick Carter,
Deep Dish, Magda, Theo Parish, and many more.  The main goal of the
"Intellect" project was to make an informative DVD that could help DJs
advance their careers in electronic music. The result was Crenshaw himself
starting dirtybird records and a production career under the alias Claude
VonStroke.

Since 2005, dirtybird has managed to solidify a reputation for releasing
oddball classic techno and house tracks, and in the process has become one
of the hottest labels on the planet. The outdoor dirtybird parties in San
Francisco's scenic Golden Gate Park have also become a legendary summer
destination point for both locals and international travelers.

In addition to production and label management, Claude VonStroke has an
intense regimen for preparation and a great ear for song selection. His DJ
sets are always inspiring and surprising. You will never hear a set of
monotonous music because Claude always takes time to find the special cuts
that make for a completely original experience that is not to be missed.

In 2008, Claude is hard at work on his second album, in addition to
fostering his latest project, Mothership Records.  Mothership was started in
2007 as VonStroke's outlet for deep and experimental techno. The first
record on Mothership became a summer classic and sold 7,000 vinyl records
and sat at #1 on the Beatport minimal techno chart for 8 weeks. Proceeds
from the label go towards children's music education in Claude's hometown of
Detroit, Michigan.

Claude's special set for [KONTROL] will feature a deeper, darker techno side
of this fun-loving bear-shaped man!

This week /// 22 February, 2008 /// 9pm-1am Pacific Standard Time /// 
http://radio.defsf.com:1200/ <http://www.zer01.net:1200/>

Ok so electro has been always this misunderstood genre.. where people 
automatically do a bad impression of a broken robot, or worse, think its 
something that Benni Benassi made up. Yet, has anybody really 
investigated how super sick and awesome true electro really is?! Well, I 
know at least a few people who have, and so tonight I have the pleasure 
to bring you two super fresh djs that are bringing the goods! Tonight on 
radio integrated its ILL-ECTRO night with the sounds of:

DJS:

->INDIGO

Indigo first got into electro when he was 8 years old - it happened 
during the scene in the movie 'Breakin' where Turbo is dancing to 
Kraftwerk's 'Tour de France' ( incidentally this scene was stolen from 
fred astaire)- and was instantly hooked.

Philip aka Dj Indigo started spinning in 1994 when he lived in the same 
neighborhood in San Jose as the Harmony kids. He would hang out in 
Jeremy's garage, and they would get too stoned, leaving the decks open 
for him to play. The setup was a pair of belt-drive turntables from the 
Goodwill store.  A stalwart young DJ Indigo would have these crappy 
decks all to himself while the harmony kids on the couch across the room 
and ate their junk food from the 7-eleven down the street. Whenever 
Indigo would trainwreck, they would groan and throw things at him. Thus, 
young DJ's mixing skills improved pretty quickly in that environment. 
once Indigo finally got himself a pair of 1200's, he couldn't believe 
how easy it was to beatmatch on them.

Early influences were DJ Dan, the Wicked Full Moon parties, Galen, and 
Sabin

crews: Urban Wasteland, Friends & Family

&

->SHEZTEK


Tom Shez Lee (aka ShezTek) has been spinning and
collecting for over 12 years. He is a classically
trained violinist and pianist and grew up attending
magnet schools for music in Miami, FL. While at school
at MIT (Cambridge, MA), he began to be exposed to EDM
music and the community it fostered. It wasn't soon
after that he wanted to give back to that community
and started DJing and helping throw some parties. His
musical tastes are easy to pick out since he grew up
in Miami with the sounds of Miami Bass, Electro and
Freestyle.


crews: Moksha tribe and Evil Breaks

Ok so electro has been always this misunderstood genre.. where people 
automatically do a bad impression of a broken robot, or worse, think its 
something that Benni Benassi made up. Yet, has anybody really 
investigated how super sick and awesome true electro really is?! Well, I 
know at least a few people who have, and so tonight I have the pleasure 
to bring you two super fresh djs that are bringing the goods! Tonight on 
radio integrated its ILL-ECTRO night with the sounds of:

DJS:

->INDIGO

Indigo first got into electro when he was 8 years old - it happened 
during the scene in the movie 'Breakin' where Turbo is dancing to 
Kraftwerk's 'Tour de France' ( incidentally this scene was stolen from 
fred astaire)- and was instantly hooked.

Philip aka Dj Indigo started spinning in 1994 when he lived in the same 
neighborhood in San Jose as the Harmony kids. He would hang out in 
Jeremy's garage, and they would get too stoned, leaving the decks open 
for him to play. The setup was a pair of belt-drive turntables from the 
Goodwill store.  A stalwart young DJ Indigo would have these crappy 
decks all to himself while the harmony kids on the couch across the room 
and ate their junk food from the 7-eleven down the street. Whenever 
Indigo would trainwreck, they would groan and throw things at him. Thus, 
young DJ's mixing skills improved pretty quickly in that environment. 
once Indigo finally got himself a pair of 1200's, he couldn't believe 
how easy it was to beatmatch on them.

Early influences were DJ Dan, the Wicked Full Moon parties, Galen, and 
Sabin

->SHEZTEK


Tom Shez Lee (aka ShezTek) has been spinning and
collecting for over 12 years. He is a classically
trained violinist and pianist and grew up attending
magnet schools for music in Miami, FL. While at school
at MIT (Cambridge, MA), he began to be exposed to EDM
music and the community it fostered. It wasn't soon
after that he wanted to give back to that community
and started DJing and helping throw some parties. His
musical tastes are easy to pick out since he grew up
in Miami with the sounds of Miami Bass, Electro and
Freestyle.

Haha... Yeah, it was a little short, we were cut off a bit early so the next
band could play while their friends still had the patience to stick around.

Man oh man... playing for normals who come to hear their friend's rock band
is challenging! Phew! So far we've only played shows for freaks who were
really into it, so this was kind of an interesting experience for us. The
crowd was almost entirely made up of friends of the second band. Is that
what little rock shows are like?  I've been a raver for so long, I kinda
don't remember.  I really enjoy playing for ravers at real parties much more
(or at least places where people are on drugs, jeez!).  Raver kids are way
more into the glowsticks and spray glitter anyway.   ;)

Ok so electro has been always this misunderstood genre.. where people
automatically do a bad impression of a broken robot, or worse, think its
something that Benni Benassi made up. Yet, has anybody really investigated
how super sick and awesome true electro really is?! Well, I know at least a
few people who have, and so tonight I have the pleasure to bring you two
super fresh djs that are bringing the goods! Tonight on radio integrated its
ILL-ECTRO night with the sounds of:

DJS:

Indigo first got into electro when he was 8 years old - it happened during
the scene in the movie 'Breakin' where Turbo is dancing to Kraftwerk's 'Tour
de France' ( incidentally this scene was stolen from fred astaire)- and was
instantly hooked.

Philip aka DJ Indigo started spinning in 1994 when he lived in the same
neighborhood in San Jose as the Harmony kids. He would hang out in Jeremy's
garage, and they would get too stoned, leaving the decks open for him to
play. The setup was a pair of belt-drive turntables from the Goodwill
store.  A stalwart young DJ Indigo would have these crappy decks all to
himself while the harmony kids on the couch across the room and ate their
junk food from the 7-eleven down the street. Whenever Indigo would
trainwreck, they would groan and throw things at him. Thus, young DJ's
mixing skills improved pretty quickly in that environment. once Indigo
finally got himself a pair of 1200's, he couldn't believe how easy it was to
beatmatch on them.

This week /// 22 February, 2008 /// 9pm-1am Pacific Standard Time /// 
http://radio.defsf.com:1200/ <http://www.zer01.net:1200/>

Ok so electro has been always this misunderstood genre.. where people 
automatically do a bad impression of a broken robot, or worse, think its 
something that Benni Benassi made up. Yet, has anybody really 
investigated how super sick and awesome true electro really is?! Well, I 
know at least a few people who have, and so tonight I have the pleasure 
to bring you two super fresh djs that are bringing the goods! Tonight on 
radio integrated its ILL-ECTRO night with the sounds of:

DJS:

->INDIGO

Indigo first got into electro when he was 8 years old - it happened 
during the scene in the movie 'Breakin' where Turbo is dancing to 
Kraftwerk's 'Tour de France' ( incidentally this scene was stolen from 
fred astaire)- and was instantly hooked.

Philip aka Dj Indigo started spinning in 1994 when he lived in the same 
neighborhood in San Jose as the Harmony kids. He would hang out in 
Jeremy's garage, and they would get too stoned, leaving the decks open 
for him to play. The setup was a pair of belt-drive turntables from the 
Goodwill store.  A stalwart young DJ Indigo would have these crappy 
decks all to himself while the harmony kids on the couch across the room 
and ate their junk food from the 7-eleven down the street. Whenever 
Indigo would trainwreck, they would groan and throw things at him. Thus, 
young DJ's mixing skills improved pretty quickly in that environment. 
once Indigo finally got himself a pair of 1200's, he couldn't believe 
how easy it was to beatmatch on them.

Early influences were DJ Dan, the Wicked Full Moon parties, Galen, and 
Sabin

crews: Urban Wasteland, Friends & Family

->SHEZTEK


Tom Shez Lee (aka ShezTek) has been spinning and
collecting for over 12 years. He is a classically
trained violinist and pianist and grew up attending
magnet schools for music in Miami, FL. While at school
at MIT (Cambridge, MA), he began to be exposed to EDM
music and the community it fostered. It wasn't soon
after that he wanted to give back to that community
and started DJing and helping throw some parties. His
musical tastes are easy to pick out since he grew up
in Miami with the sounds of Miami Bass, Electro and
Freestyle.

Subject: [sfraves] Historical Achievement- First Psychedelic Research at Harvard since 1966!  (MAPS)

Content-Type: text/plain;

On Saturday, February 23, 2008, after more than a decade of hard work,  
Dr. John Halpern conducted the first experimental session in his study  
of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in twelve subjects with treatment- 
resistant anxiety associated with advanced-stage cancer (or PDF). Dr.  
Halpern is also conducting a major five-year NIDA-funded study into  
the neurocognitive risks of heavy use of Ecstasy, enhancing his  
ability to balance the risks and benefits of MDMA. This historic start  
of the MDMA/cancer anxiety study would not have been possible without  
the contributions of many people, including his co-investigators, the  
members of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at both the Lahey Clinic  
Medical Center and McLean Hospital, both institutions' administrators  
and staff, and federal regulatory officials at FDA and even DEA. The  
study's $250,000 budget  is funded by Mr. Peter Lewis through a direct  
grant to McLean Hospital. MAPS assisted Dr. Halpern in the protocol  
design and approval process.

This experimental session was the first time in 42 years that a  
psychedelic was administered to a research subject at Harvard Medical  
School. Dr. Walter Pahnke, who conducted the classic Good Friday  
experiment in 1962, reported on the conclusion of his psilocybin  
research at Harvard in an unpublished paper written in 1966 (PDF).

The renaissance in psychedelic research has begun. It is now time to  
prove what we have been claiming for decades, that psychedelic- 
assisted psychotherapy can be beneficial to some patients in carefully  
controlled clinical settings. The promising results from MAPS'  US  
MDMA/PTSD research, and the start of Dr. Halpern's MDMA/cancer anxiety  
study, suggest that the eventualapproval of psychedelic psychotherapy   
is becoming more than a dream.

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for  
your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap of  
empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."  - 
Fritz Williams

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone,  
but it worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: DJ Grooverider jailed in Dubai

i think forest was telling me when she was traveling on a plane and 
someone stuck some smoke in her bag. she didn't find out until after she 
arrived home.. probably the same story with grooverider.. nobody is that 
stupid. and people with the green are always way too generous for their 
own good sometimes and their best judgement is elsewhere when they're 
thinking about 'the kind.'

This morning a lady at my work called in from the SJ Police station saying that she had been arrested for, yes, running INTO a police car yesterday. 

Her words: "It was the car or the cop." 

I guess she's locked-up because she refused to take a urine/blood test (there was a *problem with the Breathalyzer). That, and well, the other "thing with the car."

Moral of the story: I only respect her more. I hope she doesn't get fired. Sorry, can't name names, but I thought the story was worth sharing.

Happy Monday!

I know it....I love the damn thing, but it is super low-slung on 
me...definitely made for someone taller and wider than I am.

Sucks, cuz I never know if I need a Large or XL size when I buy jackets...it 
all depends on fit.

You guys remember the spot for Adriana's fund raiser?

Our current schedule is EVERY FRIDAY!!!   2a-5a

Rotating DJ's, drinks, and fun!  We added a stripper pole with stage 
just to have something to play on in the back room.  We've done a lot of 
work around the space and it's looking good.

Come down, say hi.

Epiphany of Sound with J.C. - Thursday from 9AM-12PM PST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After 14 years, DJ J.C.'s techno/house/electronica showcase has
garnered much attention and devotion. Like most folks at Stanford's
radio station, he's a volunteer, proving that his motivation isn't
a paycheck; it's his passion to share his interest in one of music's
most eclectic genres. With his conversational style, inclusion of
producers and musicians from both the local & international scene,
and his stewardship of the station's 24-hour marathons during
Solstices and Equinoxes, it's no wonder that DJ J.C has made a
connection with listeners in a very crowded market. Catch his live
broadcasts or listen to the previous week's program at underheard.org.

J.C. will email this week if he has an update on any guests.

Thanks for your support!!!

HA! Catalyst is allowing DJ's again?

They have good drinks, but my experience with that spot (as far as throwing 
an event) was poor at best. This is a damn good cause though, so everyone 
who can go, should.

(plus the lineup kicks ass!)

they might not allow DJs anymore once we get done with the place ;)

for reals though, i think they are under new management. i've got a great relationship with the manager there so far, so i'm looking forward to a quality event. the sound is certainly not the beefiest in town, but we really want to get athletic party types talking to each other, so it should work out well.

plus there are 4 of us riding aids/lifecycle in june, and we need to raise $2500 each to be eligible to break our asses ;) please help us out!

love,
mo

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:: @narcho - a special VOID show tonight..





Tonight's show will be noticeably different. Yes noticeably. There will be
no mixing at all, and I'll be mostly dispensing with the psychedelically
tinged, spaced out rock and disco-fied sounds I so often spin on the show.
Instead, I'll be taking a far noisier nostalgia ride into one of the most
important yet brief periods of my life -

the era of the anarcho-punk scene.

The anarcho scene was a mostly British phenomenon from the early 80's,
spawned from the ashes of punk rock and led by bands like Crass, The Mob,
and The Poison Girls. It was heavily fuelled by the politics of @narchy,
situationism and a desire to bring about a more utopian world through
autonomous living and direct action.

It was also in many ways responsible for helping birth the modern indie
music scene with it's novel, experimental and totally DIY approach to music
creation, production, distribution and setting up record labels, which
completely ignored the established music industry of the time.
Though long dead, and not well documented, the effects of the anarcho scene
are still with us today, it's DIY approach very much carried over into the
rave and rock scenes of the 90's and beyond..

The playlist for tonight's show is limited, which means a shorter show, so
TUNE IN EARLY or you may miss it completely. I will however be padding the
show out with some chatter about the bands and music, along with some music
from other artists who shared the unconventional philosophical outlooks of
the anarcho scene, or had some influence on it - groups like Can, Public
Image, The Raincoats, Dead Kennedys etc. So in some ways tonight's show will
be similar to the post-punk shows I've done in the past..

Join Jeno at 9pm tonight, Tues Feb 26th..

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP:: @narcho - a special VOID show tonight..


The Bay Area punk scene has been (and still is) one of my personal faves...=
I definitely see it as critical to the USA punk movement as much as DC, LA =
or NYC.=20

Another favorite old skool Bay Area punk band I love, was the Avengers...ci=
rca like '79 or so. Their self titled debut is fuckin' crucial.

Big ups the Bay's music scene in general though....I think a myriad of soun=
ds are really well represented here.=20

Incidentally, this show has been interesting tonight...at times a bit tedio=
us, but I still love to hear a huge one of my musical influences play stuff=
 that may have shaped or influenced them in some small way. Hotness.

oh and let's not forget "On Broadway" and "the Farm!".

Damn, Specimen, the Nuns, Verbal Abuse, Peter & the Testtube Babies, Stalag

For those that are to young to remember, there was a pretty hot punk scene 
in the SF bay area at that time centered around the Mabuhay Gardens, 
Berkeley Square, etc.  Don't know if he'll play any of the local bands that 
spawned around that time such as the Dead Kennedys, The Mutants, the Circle 
Jerks, and Flipper.

But here's some pictures from that time:

I was never really a punk, but one of the people in this photo was my high

Another note about this quote, if you could call it that, I stayed up =20
kind of late, well not late in raver terms, but late in the sense that =20
I had to get up early and drive over the hill to an early class, and =20
copied parts of what was I think a really important 2 hour interview =20
with the man who broke all the big Clinton scandals.  You might think =20
he's crazy or lying and not worth listening to, I would argue that if =20
you're thinking of voting for Hillary in 2008, you should listen to =20
the claims he makes and do some research to find out if they're true =20
or not.  Anyway have a nice Wednesday and remember ... it's not how =20
high you are, it's hi, how are you.

Sorry for the lengthy post ... might I suggest a human rave chain from
SF to SJ ... they did it in Lithuania and soon after the wall fell.

What you all don't know about about Hillary ... you know why Bill
married her?  Her father, Hugh Rodham, was the head of the mob in
Chicago.  He had a partner named Dan Rostenkowsky.  And it just so
happened (he) happened to be part of the most powerful Ways and Means
Committee in Washington ... then they appointed Webb Hubbell to
Attorney General, because they knew anyone else they appointed, I'd
get ... but then I got Webb Hubbell and put him in prison ... I had
caught Vince and Hillary screwin ... at that time, my feud was with
Bill Clinton ... Vince thought that tape was fixin' to be aired in the
Washington Times ... I have no idea if he was murdered or not ... but
the autopsy was obvious ... he didn't die in Fort Marcy Park ... I
went to the Rose Law Firm and caught them with boxes marked V.F.
taking them to be burned ... there was no way Bill Clinton would have
been reelected, except for one person ... Bob Dole ... the thing you
need to be the most afraid of, and you should be afraid ... it was all
scheduled that Bill would run, they would wait, and then she would run
... I've been a part of destroying countries you have never even heard
of ... the Puppetmasters control everything ... how do you think the
Clintons come up with all this money?  And who do you think controls
the war in Iraq?  Malachi has asked Bush twice to leave ... we ain't
leavin' ... y'all think you're votin' for President ... you're not
gonna pick who's President ... others are ... but the way they're
gonna get us is ... they're taking American jobs ... there's a term in
social engineering called empowerment ... they want to disempower the
people, because if you have enough money you can control your future
... and they're strippin' us down ... and we don't have two years ...
this thing's over in two years, buddy.

There's one way to beat 'em.

... you'll know no difference between George Bush and the Clinton
Administration.  Does it not make sense to you that since the statue
of Saddam Hussein came down that the oil companies have made the
largest quarterly profits in the history of the world?  Nothing's
gonna change.  The only thing that will be different is Hillary will
be the boss.  We're gonna go back to the old Clinton days in Arkansas.
    You cross them, they'll kill you ... Bush don't care ... you cross
Hillary, you won't live to see tomorrow.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR?: Lock Bumping

Two questions...

Where does one procure a bump key?

(post obtaining bump-key)

Who wants to take a looooooooooooooong stroll through the Presidio?

=)

(yes, I am kidding, relax kids)

For the record, I thought this was going to be about what kinds of keys are 
better for doing key bumps with. I personally prefer either VW or AUDI car 
keys for these, as they have that scoopy/channel type area that holds alot 
w/o much product loss.

;p

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: More impeachable offenses?

By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
Wed Feb 27, 3:33 AM ET



WASHINGTON - When Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald wanted to find out what 
was going on inside Vice President Dick Cheney's office, the prosecutor in the 
CIA leak probe made a logical move. He dropped a grand jury subpoena on the 
White House for all the relevant e-mail.

One problem: Even though White House computer technicians hunted high and low, 
an entire week's worth of e-mail from Cheney's office was missing. The week was 
Sept. 30, 2003, to Oct. 6, 2003, the opening days of the Justice Department's 
probe into whether anyone at the White House leaked the identity of CIA 
operative Valerie Plame.

Toyota keys work well, too.

But yeah, bump keys are nothing new.

Also, we should raid the Presidio and throw a massive rave there. They got
plenty of abandoned buildings, they shouldn't mind.

Interesting read, Whitehousegate? Seems like there's a laundry list of impeachable offenses, does nobody have the nads to go through with it?

Sheeit, I'll do it. Let me @ those two jerks! I'll impeach them into next Tuesday.

WASHINGTON - When Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald wanted to find out what 
was going on inside Vice President Dick Cheney's office, the prosecutor in the 
CIA leak probe made a logical move. He dropped a grand jury subpoena on the 
White House for all the relevant e-mail.

One problem: Even though White House computer technicians hunted high and low, 
an entire week's worth of e-mail from Cheney's office was missing. The week was 
Sept. 30, 2003, to Oct. 6, 2003, the opening days of the Justice Department's 
probe into whether anyone at the White House leaked the identity of CIA 
operative Valerie Plame.

Yeah, this is absolutely a no no.  

Since its a national park I think federal not local laws apply in the Presidio.

With that said, some might remember that the now defunct Revolution Magazine threw a faux rave in the "glass palace" at the Presidio back in the days of the Internet boom.

Regards,

Peter

PS bumbp keys are old news... There are videos out there that detail how to make them.  I won't post a link, but Google will tell you...  ;)

Subject: [sfraves] Presidio parties (was Re: [sfraves] SRR?: Lock Bumping)

i was part of a crew that threw a rave at the Presidio.  it was a  
fundraiser for the SF National Organization for Women (NOW) education  
fund.  this was in 1997 or 1998.

we threw the party in the Letterman Gymnasium. there were 300+ people,  
a bouncy castle, and two systems.  the fire department showed up  
because an alarm went off, and we STILL went 'til 7 am!

one of the benefits of doing a party WITH PERMISSION in a federal  
facility is that you don't generally need permits. local po-po or the  
sheriff are usually the ones busting parties. the National Park Police  
don't give a crap, so long as you're totally obvious about it and have  
permission to be using the facility. but do an outdoor renegade, and  
they'll shut you down real quick.

one of the benefits of doing a party WITH PERMISSION in a federal 
facility is that you don't generally need permits. local po-po or the 
sheriff are usually the ones busting parties. the National Park Police 
don't give a crap, so long as you're totally obvious about it and have 
permission to be using the facility. but do an outdoor renegade, and 
they'll shut you down real quick.

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] :: Last Fridays @ Anu is THIS Friday, west coast Techno special appearances ::

Friday, 29 February 2008

RAY presents:

F A K T I O N : because san francisco needs another techno cult
with special guests:

DJ Developer -- Modularz Sound Division [ Los Angeles|the world ]
Endosine -- Drum Machine Museum [ San Francisco|Berlin ] // Live

Last Fridays at:
Anu-Bar
43 Sixth St., San Francisco, CA

DJ Developer is known throughout the US, Mexico and abroad for quick mixing
abilities and for leading LA's second wave of Techno.  In 2004 he shifted
his
focus to production.  Now in 2008 he demonstrates his mastery of both: He
launched the label "Modularz Sound Division" with Detroit legend Fanon
Flowers
(now living in Los Angeles) and is performing in public again, producing
shows
under the Modularz name, featuring various talented artists from LA and
elsewhere.

Join us for this San Francisco appearance before Developer begins the
European
leg of his tour in Spain and beyond.

Endosine: Literally translated, Endosine is the wave within. The modulating
force within all existence. Techno is everywhere, an element of the natural
and mechanized constructs around us. Connect to the wave within. Connect to
Endosine.

This will be Endosine's last US appearance before he flies off to Berlin for
an extended stay, working on production and advancing the standards of
Techno
and Electronica.

10 PM to 2 AM
Cost: $5 21+

Sorry, got a little ahead of myself. I was checking out this deal @ 1015 on Friday called The Pirates vs. The Clowns. Headlining is Uberzone vs. The Bassbin Twins. I was just reading the flyer, they called Mutaytor a 36-Strong Indy Tech DJ Circus or something like that. Sorry, no mix links, yet.

Alas, I'm going to check out the Space Cowboys deal in Tahoe this weekend. Hope everyone has a good one!

peace

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

I have once again taken up running, not so much for me to look sexy  
for you, but so I feel good, I think.  And I saw an 80 year old woman  
out there running this morning.  Maybe she knows something!

I want to bring up something Doug posted a few weeks ago about the  
debt owed to black people for slavery.  I didn't really read it, I  
think I skimmed over it, I probably should have.  I wish I had 48  
hours in a day, but frankly that probably wouldn't be enough time for  
the research I want to do.  But I would pose a question, at what point  
would we move on from the hard feelings while at the same time  
remembering the dangers of those times?

Not sure which night yer checking out Space Cowboys, but Yellow no. 5 (the
crew who now has the Purgatory Cruiser) is having their 2 year anniversary
celebration at Incline Village Saturday night.  Should be a good party.

An odd side note- the founder and head honcho of Mutaytor was apparently "caught" by "To Catch A Predator".  A lot of the time, the way that show operates just makes my skin crawl, but I'm not sure about the details of his capture.

In any case, I'm not sure if he is still associated with Mutaytor, just a tidbit.

I'm a Buddhist gun lover.

These folding things are cool, but I'd want to fire it.  I'm a little skeptical...

FWIW, I've fired the following very loud ass kicking weapons:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M240_machine_gun
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M249_Squad_Automatic_Weapon
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M203_grenade_launcher

There is video too.

Fire burst of seven, but please shoot targets only.

I don't know that I'd want bumps "launched" at me...I guess it would depend

What was the grenade launcher like? Where did you get to fire off that puppy?

These folding things are cool, but I'd want to fire it.  I'm a little skeptical...

FWIW, I've fired the following very loud ass kicking weapons:

There is video too.

Fire burst of seven, but please shoot targets only.

ok it strikes me that this guy is very paranoid.. i'm going out for a 
walk with my dog and i just need my.. um let's see little plastic 
baggies, check. leash, check. dog.. can't forget that one..my keys, 
check. oh and lest we not forget the semi automatic folding machine gun!

hello! it get's rough out here in the burbs!

does anybody realise how primitive it is to shoot a gun? i mean 
essentially we're still throwing tiny rocks at each other at high 
velocity.. where are my sharks in the big tank with the fricken lazer 
beams!?

well i can say for one a lazer can shoot farther than any gun without 
gravity getting in the way and if science can invent a lazer that shaves 
skin off an old lady's face surely we can get something better than a gun

and maybe even non lethal?

raves?  huh?

i consider myself a member of the Guns & Dope Party, so I find this to  
be very rave-related.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: FMG-9 (I'm not a gun guy, but if I was. . .)

In order to get a laser beam concentrated enough to do any sort of killing, 
it'd take up an entire warehouse room....not exactly the most efficient way 
to kill one human at a time really.

So "tiny rocks" still win.

ugh... seems like it's impossible to have a conversation about the mutaytor without someone dredging up the matty nash/to catch a predator dirt. i guess everyone loves a good load of dirty laundry. 

no, he's not involved with the band anymore. 

 yes, they still create and perform some exceptionally kick-ass music.

it's unfortunate that the entire outfit (over 30 members) was punished for the actions of one idiot, but that's business for you. here's an article from about a year ago where buck down explains some of the band's history, the issues surrounding the bust, next steps for the mutaytor, etc.

happy learning :)

love,

Saturday March 29th, 2008
10PM to 6AM In celebration of the rebirth of MOKSHA TRIBE, we bring you...

to the worship of the fiery sun and sun gods such as Mexico's
Quetzalcoatl, it was named "a god of Phoenecia" by the Phoenician. To
alchemists, it symbolized the the destruction and creation of new forms of
matter along the way to the ultimate transformation: physical and
spiritual

10PM to 6AM In celebration of the rebirth of MOKSHA TRIBE, we bring you...
PHOENIX

A universal symbol of the sun, mystical rebirth, resurrection and
immortality, this legendary red "fire bird" was believed to die in its
self-made flames periodically then rise again out of its own ashes. Linked
to the worship of the fiery sun and sun gods such as Mexico's
Quetzalcoatl, it was named "a god of Phoenecia" by the Phoenician. To
alchemists, it symbolized the the destruction and creation of new forms of
matter along the way to the ultimate transformation: physical and
spiritual

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

Well it's 7:20 on the East Coast.

What gets you up in the morning?  I've been asked that question a lot =20
at various times in the last 15 years of my life.  It started, I =20
believe in my Equinox days.  Remember that company?  Shut down, kind =20
of like the rave scene, only in a more permanent way.  I know, there's =20
more to that story.  Possibly the next batch of hearing it came in =20
other success related things, the Franklin Day Planner seminars, =20
reading books like Covey and Orman.  Maybe not specifically, I'm =20
really not sure where.  Maybe I hear Alex Jones bellowing it through =20
his microphone once in a while.  And don't email me and say I'm sexist =20
and the microphone is some kind of phallic symbol.  Just save it.

By the way, there is this girl up at UCSC this week selling vagina =20
pops to raise money for charity and there are Vagina Monologues being =20
done I think at Porter.  1 for $3 and 2 for $5.

Anyway, this play I saw up at school last night (Subject B's =20
Confession), had me thinking about other things related to it, and =20
that's what woke me up this morning.  Who needs an alarm clock anymore?

OK that's it for now, have a nice day and please think about how =20
"change" is related to "We Are Change".  Due by Friday night (well =20
Saturday morning) at 2AM.

--

Do you know where your children are?  We do.

- Subject B's Confession

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2/29 not 3/29 --> Re: [sfraves] BSP: 3-29: Simple: Breaks all night!!!!



right.  party collision, that's why I can't go catch D and why I had to
plug Faktion again. =)

Sorry if we're confusing everyone!  There's like 6 parties tonight, but it's
all good.  Come visit all of us for drinks and stuff!  In and out ok for mine
if people pay the door (if they leave before we start charging and come back
the guy helping with the door may not remember em, $5 means a hand stamp), so
meet up on scenic 6th street, then you can all rideshare over to the UG loc
or something =)  Help keep local EDM alive a few bucks at a time!


So, TONIGHT, 29 Feb:
Osby: UG location
Ray: Anu, 43 6th st
Others: umm, I've lost track of all the parties tonight. :P

Osby: UG: Simple: Breaky stuff except for D's techno
(I'm expecting hard techno when I see D's name?)
Ray: Bar(Anu):  Faktion: Techno/minimal and live PA of techno-like genre.
(Endosine's kinda experimental, techno, electronica, I suck at describing)

Osby: 10p-5a or later?
Ray: 10p-2a for the cool music, but it's a bar so people can drink starting
whenever if 21+.

Did that help in the slightest?

Subject: [sfraves] 3/29 and comprehensive collision insurance

hey i thought that SFR was a place where we could tell each other what 
was happening and we couldn't step on each other's toes. let's communic8 
and give some support. also it pays to be proactive and promote your 
parties well in advance so people don't all equally lose money.. i'm all 
for competition and survival of the fittest but there are times when 
great parties get unnoticed because of another more conveniently located 
party is in the hood.

i think the SFR calendar  was devised to assist in calling these nights. 
does that cal. still effectively work? anybody still maintaining that? 
i'd consider signing up for it again if all the great bsps were there 
instead of here.

la la la..

There are far too many parties happening every night to not "step on others 
toes" as far as party promoting, etc.

Survival of the fittest sadly.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 2/29 not 3/29 --> Re: [sfraves] BSP: 3-29: Simple: Breaks all night!!!!

God you ain't kidding, there IS a ton going on tonight.  Jump is also going
own at Shine with my old time inspirations, Ethan and Micron and Forest.
With my timeslot at Simple and the drive from Sac to SF, I'll probably not 
make either Faktion or Jump
but i'm gonna try to stop by each for a minute if the troops in tow can get
their shit togeter early enough.  Come to think of it, I probably caused
some confusion when I went on my rant about Forest's Bday.  I know she's
starting the celebrating at Shine and just meant if she came by Simple
afterwards, well that's where I'd be unleasing my fury of ass spanking.

Even with the confusion, I don't think any real toe-stepping occurred.  Life 
did seem less confusing when Karina was updating the SFR calendar ... any 
chance someone can pony up for that task again?

Oh and about expecting me to whip out some hard techno tonight, I dunno. I'm 
actually more of a general tech-whore than a "hard techno" dj and what I 
play really has to do with the occassion.  I'll probably slip out a more 
proper tech-heavy set when me & amber hit up Faktion in April (pre-plug, 
yes, it is!) but as for tonight, I might come out with anything from 
tech-funk to tech-breaks to heavy tech-house and sure, if I got a hyphy 
crowd the hard 4x4 might come out of my back pocket.. it just depends... but 
tech-y, I'm sure it will be.  But we'll have to see what actually comes out, 
once I get there.  Either way, a wild ride will be in order...

tonights.... gonna be a great night... all around..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 3/29 and comprehensive collision insurance



Well, we try not to, but there were 5 fridays and 4 saturdays this month,
and there's a lot more than 9 of us throwing parties these days, so some
overlap is unavoidable.  There are different musical foci, there are
undergrounds and clubs, most of which simply adds up to more choice
for music lovers.  I would think that most of us aren't specifically
trying to compete against our own friends here, there are just times
when the different scheduling strategies overlap.

I took over last fridays at Anu when Filter left it in large part because
it's a mostly open night, but there are still going to be special Fridays,
leap years, in 2010 NYE will be a Friday, etc.   For the most part, parties
all book starting about 2 months ahead, though I'm trying to get mine a
good ammount further out now, and regardless it's hard on all of us to
start booking a night and finish and announce, all in a small enough
window to not collide, especially given the small number of good days
each month for a party.

I think it's less about survival of the fittest than it is trying to
give people choices and trying to figure out how to hurt ourselves the
least while doing it.  We're all presumably in this to have fun ourselves,
and most of us seem to like going to each others parties when we don't
overlap.  Back in business school they used to call it coopetition. =)

Calendar sounds great, but still raises the question of when do we
claim dates, when we start booking or when we have a party fully
committed?  First come first served on the calendar, or a minimum
set of required shit-togetherness to qualify?  Or just an open info
forum so we all know what we're all planning?

I took over last fridays at Anu when Filter left it in large part because
it's a mostly open night, but there are still going to be special Fridays,
leap years, in 2010 NYE will be a Friday, etc.   For the most part, parties
all book starting about 2 months ahead, though I'm trying to get mine a
good ammount further out now, and regardless it's hard on all of us to
start booking a night and finish and announce, all in a small enough
window to not collide, especially given the small number of good days
each month for a party.

I think it's less about survival of the fittest than it is trying to
give people choices and trying to figure out how to hurt ourselves the
least while doing it.  We're all presumably in this to have fun ourselves,
and most of us seem to like going to each others parties when we don't
overlap.  Back in business school they used to call it coopetition. =)

Calendar sounds great, but still raises the question of when do we
claim dates, when we start booking or when we have a party fully
committed?  First come first served on the calendar, or a minimum
set of required shit-togetherness to qualify?  Or just an open info
forum so we all know what we're all planning?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 3/29 and comprehensive collision insurance

The idea of promoters "claiming dates" is kind of preposterous to me. It's 
always annoyed me when I'd attempt to throw an event and hear people bitch 
about it "competing" with other promoters events.

I mean...if you don't want me throwing an event that competes, why don't you 
book me so I have something else going on that night? No booking for your 
party? Expect some healthy competition! There is an entire city with SCADS 
of people who listen to EDM here to appease, there is no good reason for 
people not to do whatever the fuck they want w/o regard for other people's 
events.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 3/29 and comprehensive collision insurance

i don't really think "claiming dates" is necessary.  the point of the 
calendar was always to serve as a single source where people could go and 
see what was going on in a single night.  there have always been multiple 
events and there always will be.  so no pissing on any date is necessary - 
and if i remember correctly, you could post the details of your event as far 
in advance as you wanted (as long as those details are complete and 
finalized) and as soon as the week before...  other last minutes events were 
always posted the last minute, but it's not 1999 anymore folks , so I bet 
that'd be at a minimum...

it's not about a competition.  like i said, it's 1999 anymore boys.

even if i'm booked at other events, i don't see other events going on the 
same night as competition, but then again, I bring a wider out of town heads 
on account and don't won't accept gigs that appeal to the same crowd at more 
than one evnent, so i can do 2 parties (or even 3) different events in the 
bay these days and i've seen them all sell out...

it's all about doing your own thing and just being as careful as you can to 
avoid events on single nights that might draw the same crowd and follow a 
similar theme.

i think everyone tonight will do well.

so see y'all tonight!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 3/29 and comprehensive collision insurance

Yea, ratify on all of that.

I guess maybe the "competition" thing seems ot happen in the lovely world o' 
breakbeats more than any other scene. I have literally had people tell me 
not to throw an event on a certain night because other crewss might see it 
as direct competiton. And again I say...well, if you aren't gonna book me 
for your event, then don't be fuggin' surprised when I throw my own. Not 
that I do a lot of event throwing, I am far too poor for that - but it does 
occasionally happen, and when I do, the last thing I wanna deal with is 
whiny promoters bitching about me taking from their crowd. (I never realized 
people owned any particular crowd anyway - sheesh)

This is probably why I just try and help other people out with  their events 
now anyway...less stress for me and I still get to be part of the process. 
Helping out can be equally as reqarding.

The SFR calendar is dead. However, Brian 
and I have been tossing around 2 ideas:

1. A wiki, like media-wiki, we would set it up and people would 
just add/edit events, like...a wiki!

2. I have a user-editable event CMS that my company's developed, 
we use it for some of our resort clients, I was gonna adapt it, 
slap it on sfraves.org, and start handing our individual logins 
for people to add/edit events.
here's an example:
http://www.montbleuresort.com/events.php?section=All+Events

Any thoughts?
I suppose we could just try both, lemee get that database 
started and if anyone's interested in helping, being an event 
admin let me know.

holy hell, party overload! i'm actually starting out at some dirty-filthy-disco flavored house music event in chinatown called - and i'm not kidding here - "OMGLOL". dj nisus (themovement) on the decks. no idea what to expect.

i'm hoping to make it to the jump party at shine later on. it'll be a game-time decision, as i'm headed to tahoe (squaw valley) before the crack of dawn tomorrow. info for the shine event is as follows: 

       For those who haven't heard, Alex Windsor is back in the party throwing game, kicking it off with Jump this Friday at Shine in SF. Gracing us on the decks that 
evening is also birthday girl Forest Green,  and FnF legends Ethan Miller and Micron! Should be a blast, hope y'all can join us.  
 
JUMP 
Friday, Feb. 29th 
9pm to 2am 
$5

Shine  
1337 Mission St. @ 9th
San Francisco

nobody should be hurting for options this evening. have fun!

love,
mo

right.  party collision, that's why I can't go catch D and why I had to
plug Faktion again. =)

Sorry if we're confusing everyone!  There's like 6 parties tonight, but it's
all good.  Come visit all of us for drinks and stuff!  In and out ok for mine
if people pay the door (if they leave before we start charging and come back
the guy helping with the door may not remember em, $5 means a hand stamp), so
meet up on scenic 6th street, then you can all rideshare over to the UG loc
or something =)  Help keep local EDM alive a few bucks at a time!


So, TONIGHT, 29 Feb:
Osby: UG location
Ray: Anu, 43 6th st
Others: umm, I've lost track of all the parties tonight. :P

Osby: UG: Simple: Breaky stuff except for D's techno
(I'm expecting hard techno when I see D's name?)
Ray: Bar(Anu):  Faktion: Techno/minimal and live PA of techno-like genre.
(Endosine's kinda experimental, techno, electronica, I suck at describing)

Osby: 10p-5a or later?
Ray: 10p-2a for the cool music, but it's a bar so people can drink starting
whenever if 21+.

Did that help in the slightest?

i'm just thankful that i live in a corner of the planet where "too many parties" is a real concern. i love having choices, and i also really enjoy bouncing from killer event to killer event when i can swing it. 

i do my best to show respect and common courtesy when planning a party, but the sheer volume of events makes it impossible to keep up with everything.  the way i see it, there are more than enough bouncy dancing freaks to go around. this town could certainly have worse problems than an abundance of stellar music.

love,
mo

I guess maybe the "competition" thing seems ot happen in the lovely world o' 
breakbeats more than any other scene. I have literally had people tell me 
not to throw an event on a certain night because other crewss might see it 
as direct competiton. And again I say...well, if you aren't gonna book me 
for your event, then don't be fuggin' surprised when I throw my own. Not 
that I do a lot of event throwing, I am far too poor for that - but it does 
occasionally happen, and when I do, the last thing I wanna deal with is 
whiny promoters bitching about me taking from their crowd. (I never realized 
people owned any particular crowd anyway - sheesh)

This is probably why I just try and help other people out with  their events 
now anyway...less stress for me and I still get to be part of the process. 
Helping out can be equally as reqarding.

[ K O N T R O L ]


minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup



featuring from New York City:


DEREK PLASLAIKO  ( Spectral Sound . The Bunker )

Derek Plaslaiko doesn't make records, but he sure as hell
knows how to play 'em.  One of a select few to have made
a name for himself based on DJ skills alone, Derek's
dedication and immense musical knowledge, coupled with his
anything-goes attitude make every set a memorable dance
floor experience.  Once a prominent figure on the Detroit
party scene, he relocated to NYC a few years back and was
soon crowned "Best Techno DJ" by the Village Voice.  We
simply call him "The Man", and are excited to welcome him
back for an extended encore performance.



and San Francisco's own:


CLAUDE VONSTROKE  ( Mothership . Dirtybird )

The last time our friend Barclay Crenshaw played for us,
just a couple short years ago in August '05, it was one of
the first times his pseudonym Claude VonStroke had
appeared in print on a flyer.  My how times change!  Now a
bona fide international superstar synonymous with the new
sound of SF, the inimitable 'Stroker returns to [KONTROL]
to lay down a specially crafted techno set you won't hear
anywhere else.



with [KONTROL] residents:


CRAIG KUNA  ( Platform . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO  ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )
NIKOLA BAYTALA  ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )
SAMMY D  ( Dirtybird . Utensil )

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper int=
o
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends, forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that make
the staunchest of chin-stroking, note-taking trainspotters lose their shit
on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. H=
e
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties=
.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  Wit=
h
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during tha=
t
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to hea=
d
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs a=
t
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lam=
b
monthly parties. More recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

The last time Derek played for [KONTROL] in February '07, he so thouroughly
impressed both the crowd and our resident DJs that we have been drooling
over the day we would have him back, and we're happy to report that day has
come. This time Derek comes to us as part of the "Death Is Nothing To Fear"
Spectral Residencies, on his first major US tour.

CLAUDE VONSTROKE

"I would like to come over=85what are you having for dinner?" asks the cree=
py
character in Claude VonStroke's first hit record, "Deep Throat."  After
selling through 10 pressings in 2005, "Deep Throat" quickly put VonStroke o=
n
the map as an up and coming artist.  The success of the single was followed
up by "Who's Afraid of Detroit?," another international hit championed by
Richie Hawtin who called it the "Best Track of 2006" in DJ magazine.  Soon
after he released his full length debut album, "Beware of the Bird" to
excellent reviews, further establishing him as an original talent in the
world of underground dance music. Since then, Claude has done remixes for a
very diverse group of top artists ranging all the way from indie-rock band
The Rapture, to electro legends Newcleus, to minimalists like Matt Tolfrey
and Jeff Samuel.

Claude VonStroke is better known to locals as Barclay Crenshaw, the owner o=
f
San Francisco's quirky tech-funk label, dirtybird.  The label consists of
Crenshaw (VonStroke,) friends and fellow producers Justin Martin, Christian
Martin, and Worthy, and a diverse assortment of top remixers from around th=
e
globe including John Tejada, Audion, Diplo, 3 Channels, Dj Assault, and
Kevin Saunderson.

The idea for dirtybird began in 2003 when Crenshaw was producing an intense
5 hour DVD about electronic music called, "Intellect." The project was a
labor of love, taking almost 2 years to complete and starring over 35 top
producers and legendary DJs such as Derrick May, Swayzak, Derrick Carter,
Deep Dish, Magda, Theo Parish, and many more.  The main goal of the
"Intellect" project was to make an informative DVD that could help DJs
advance their careers in electronic music. The result was Crenshaw himself
starting dirtybird records and a production career under the alias Claude
VonStroke.

Since 2005, dirtybird has managed to solidify a reputation for releasing
oddball classic techno and house tracks, and in the process has become one
of the hottest labels on the planet. The outdoor dirtybird parties in San
Francisco's scenic Golden Gate Park have also become a legendary summer
destination point for both locals and international travelers.

In addition to production and label management, Claude VonStroke has an
intense regimen for preparation and a great ear for song selection. His DJ
sets are always inspiring and surprising. You will never hear a set of
monotonous music because Claude always takes time to find the special cuts
that make for a completely original experience that is not to be missed.

In 2008, Claude is hard at work on his second album, in addition to
fostering his latest project, Mothership Records.  Mothership was started i=
n
2007 as VonStroke's outlet for deep and experimental techno. The first
record on Mothership became a summer classic and sold 7,000 vinyl records
and sat at #1 on the Beatport minimal techno chart for 8 weeks. Proceeds
from the label go towards children's music education in Claude's hometown o=
f
Detroit, Michigan.

Claude's special set for [KONTROL] will feature a deeper, darker techno sid=
e
of this fun-loving bear-shaped man!

Thaz what I'm sayin'....people should just be glad they're not living 
someplace like DC where you're lucky to get 2 decent events a week, let 
alone multiple per night.

[ K O N T R O L ]


minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup



featuring from New York City:


DEREK PLASLAIKO  ( Spectral Sound . The Bunker )

Derek Plaslaiko doesn't make records, but he sure as hell
knows how to play 'em.  One of a select few to have made
a name for himself based on DJ skills alone, Derek's
dedication and immense musical knowledge, coupled with his
anything-goes attitude make every set a memorable dance
floor experience.  Once a prominent figure on the Detroit
party scene, he relocated to NYC a few years back and was
soon crowned "Best Techno DJ" by the Village Voice.  We
simply call him "The Man", and are excited to welcome him
back for an extended encore performance.



and San Francisco's own:


CLAUDE VONSTROKE  ( Mothership . Dirtybird )

The last time our friend Barclay Crenshaw played for us,
just a couple short years ago in August '05, it was one of
the first times his pseudonym Claude VonStroke had
appeared in print on a flyer.  My how times change!  Now a
bona fide international superstar synonymous with the new
sound of SF, the inimitable 'Stroker returns to [KONTROL]
to lay down a specially crafted techno set you won't hear
anywhere else.



with [KONTROL] residents:


CRAIG KUNA  ( Platform . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO  ( Leibe*Detail . Nightlight Music )
NIKOLA BAYTALA  ( Robsoul . S.W.A.T. )
SAMMY D  ( Dirtybird . Utensil )

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper into
the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
trends, forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that make
the staunchest of chin-stroking, note-taking trainspotters lose their shit
on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. He
quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties.
He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  With
a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during that
time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to head
east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at
the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb
monthly parties. More recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
"Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.

The last time Derek played for [KONTROL] in February '07, he so thouroughly
impressed both the crowd and our resident DJs that we have been drooling
over the day we would have him back, and we're happy to report that day has
come. This time Derek comes to us as part of the "Death Is Nothing To Fear"
Spectral Residencies, on his first major US tour.

CLAUDE VONSTROKE

"I would like to come overwhat are you having for dinner?" asks the creepy
character in Claude VonStroke's first hit record, "Deep Throat."  After
selling through 10 pressings in 2005, "Deep Throat" quickly put VonStroke on
the map as an up and coming artist.  The success of the single was followed
up by "Who's Afraid of Detroit?," another international hit championed by
Richie Hawtin who called it the "Best Track of 2006" in DJ magazine.  Soon
after he released his full length debut album, "Beware of the Bird" to
excellent reviews, further establishing him as an original talent in the
world of underground dance music. Since then, Claude has done remixes for a
very diverse group of top artists ranging all the way from indie-rock band
The Rapture, to electro legends Newcleus, to minimalists like Matt Tolfrey
and Jeff Samuel.

Claude VonStroke is better known to locals as Barclay Crenshaw, the owner of
San Francisco's quirky tech-funk label, dirtybird.  The label consists of
Crenshaw (VonStroke,) friends and fellow producers Justin Martin, Christian
Martin, and Worthy, and a diverse assortment of top remixers from around the
globe including John Tejada, Audion, Diplo, 3 Channels, Dj Assault, and
Kevin Saunderson.

The idea for dirtybird began in 2003 when Crenshaw was producing an intense
5 hour DVD about electronic music called, "Intellect." The project was a
labor of love, taking almost 2 years to complete and starring over 35 top
producers and legendary DJs such as Derrick May, Swayzak, Derrick Carter,
Deep Dish, Magda, Theo Parish, and many more.  The main goal of the
"Intellect" project was to make an informative DVD that could help DJs
advance their careers in electronic music. The result was Crenshaw himself
starting dirtybird records and a production career under the alias Claude
VonStroke.

Since 2005, dirtybird has managed to solidify a reputation for releasing
oddball classic techno and house tracks, and in the process has become one
of the hottest labels on the planet. The outdoor dirtybird parties in San
Francisco's scenic Golden Gate Park have also become a legendary summer
destination point for both locals and international travelers.

In addition to production and label management, Claude VonStroke has an
intense regimen for preparation and a great ear for song selection. His DJ
sets are always inspiring and surprising. You will never hear a set of
monotonous music because Claude always takes time to find the special cuts
that make for a completely original experience that is not to be missed.

In 2008, Claude is hard at work on his second album, in addition to
fostering his latest project, Mothership Records.  Mothership was started in
2007 as VonStroke's outlet for deep and experimental techno. The first
record on Mothership became a summer classic and sold 7,000 vinyl records
and sat at #1 on the Beatport minimal techno chart for 8 weeks. Proceeds
from the label go towards children's music education in Claude's hometown of
Detroit, Michigan.

Claude's special set for [KONTROL] will feature a deeper, darker techno side
of this fun-loving bear-shaped man!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 3/29 and comprehensive collision insurance



Werd.  Like I said, it's all good, everyone loves Osby, Jump looks awesome,
I'm of course happy with the talent I've got lined up for Faktion, they're
all good parties, the only thing that bugs me is that I can't go to em all
myself. =)

I do want to avoid poaching on folks I like, but as long as we're bringing
a different focus, I don't simple date overlap as the same.  It's a little
weird when we all go into last-week promotion and finally realize it, but
I really doubt there are all that many folks who'd feel forced to choose
between parties.  There is a group of people I see at different parties
often, so maybe some of them have the "too many good choices" situation,
but overall, when I meet people, most of them don't go to all that many
parties and don't seem all that aware that they've got so many choices.

So, the real pressure is on us promoters to reach a bigger audience than
we're finding.  If there are really only 100 techno fans in the bay area
to fight over there's little point anyway.  OTOH, if there are only 100
*active* clubbers right now, and a whole lotta folks who are still waiting
for Dieter to announce that "Now is the time on Sprockets when we dance,"
then we all just need to figure out a better way to promote and get people
out of their homes.  That sounds like a great thing for us all to discuss.

metoo =)  I'm actually bringing my fly-in to this one; he was thrilled to
be presented with the opportunity of having it be the night after he
spins for Faktion anyway. 

And a great example of how we're not really competing, who here likes
techno, is 21+ and doesn't go to kontrol? =)  Great outside talent, great
resident DJs, we always know when and where it is. =)

> Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall or
> record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig deeper into
> the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking
> trends, forever on a quest to find the perfect record. The ones that make
> the staunchest of chin-stroking, note-taking trainspotters lose their shit
> on the dancefloor, hanging on every record from one to the next.
> 
> Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen
> equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7"s,
> Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit to
> the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of success. He
> quietly paid his dues on Detroit's rave circuit, and was a crucial piece of
> the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Syst3m parties of the mid-nineties.
> He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking DJ sets that were
> clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This combination resulted in
> a residency for Family, the weekly party at Detroit's legendary Motor.  With
> a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful,
> Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; sharing
> the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson,
> Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was also during that
> time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at the inaugural edition
> of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.
> 
> In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit's
> Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T.
> Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to head
> east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice of the
> Motor City to the Big Apple.  Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at
> the Bunker (Subtonic) in NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb
> monthly parties. More recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006's
> "Best Of" poll as New York's Best Techno DJ.
> 
> The last time Derek played for [KONTROL] in February '07, he so thouroughly
> impressed both the crowd and our resident DJs that we have been drooling
> over the day we would have him back, and we're happy to report that day has
> come. This time Derek comes to us as part of the "Death Is Nothing To Fear"
> Spectral Residencies, on his first major US tour.

> "I would like to come overâ¦what are you having for dinner?" asks the 
> creepy
> character in Claude VonStroke's first hit record, "Deep Throat."  After
> selling through 10 pressings in 2005, "Deep Throat" quickly put VonStroke on
> the map as an up and coming artist.  The success of the single was followed
> up by "Who's Afraid of Detroit?," another international hit championed by
> Richie Hawtin who called it the "Best Track of 2006" in DJ magazine.  Soon
> after he released his full length debut album, "Beware of the Bird" to
> excellent reviews, further establishing him as an original talent in the
> world of underground dance music. Since then, Claude has done remixes for a
> very diverse group of top artists ranging all the way from indie-rock band
> The Rapture, to electro legends Newcleus, to minimalists like Matt Tolfrey
> and Jeff Samuel.
> 
> Claude VonStroke is better known to locals as Barclay Crenshaw, the owner of
> San Francisco's quirky tech-funk label, dirtybird.  The label consists of
> Crenshaw (VonStroke,) friends and fellow producers Justin Martin, Christian
> Martin, and Worthy, and a diverse assortment of top remixers from around the
> globe including John Tejada, Audion, Diplo, 3 Channels, Dj Assault, and
> Kevin Saunderson.
> 
> The idea for dirtybird began in 2003 when Crenshaw was producing an intense
> 5 hour DVD about electronic music called, "Intellect." The project was a
> labor of love, taking almost 2 years to complete and starring over 35 top
> producers and legendary DJs such as Derrick May, Swayzak, Derrick Carter,
> Deep Dish, Magda, Theo Parish, and many more.  The main goal of the
> "Intellect" project was to make an informative DVD that could help DJs
> advance their careers in electronic music. The result was Crenshaw himself
> starting dirtybird records and a production career under the alias Claude
> VonStroke.
> 
> Since 2005, dirtybird has managed to solidify a reputation for releasing
> oddball classic techno and house tracks, and in the process has become one
> of the hottest labels on the planet. The outdoor dirtybird parties in San
> Francisco's scenic Golden Gate Park have also become a legendary summer
> destination point for both locals and international travelers.
> 
> In addition to production and label management, Claude VonStroke has an
> intense regimen for preparation and a great ear for song selection. His DJ
> sets are always inspiring and surprising. You will never hear a set of
> monotonous music because Claude always takes time to find the special cuts
> that make for a completely original experience that is not to be missed.
> 
> In 2008, Claude is hard at work on his second album, in addition to
> fostering his latest project, Mothership Records.  Mothership was started in
> 2007 as VonStroke's outlet for deep and experimental techno. The first
> record on Mothership became a summer classic and sold 7,000 vinyl records
> and sat at #1 on the Beatport minimal techno chart for 8 weeks. Proceeds
> from the label go towards children's music education in Claude's hometown of
> Detroit, Michigan.
> 
> Claude's special set for [KONTROL] will feature a deeper, darker techno side
> of this fun-loving bear-shaped man!

Subject: [sfraves] Simple tonight.. a few more things

So if you went to Adriannapollooza a few months back.. it's there... if
you're gonna go kick it @ Shine for Forest's bday... ask her for 411 since
this is her unofficial after shindig... I'm on my way to venue right
now... but yeah... please come!!!  I'll do another email run through to
see if any of y'all need 411, but those are the only 2 ummm... ways I can
provide right now because the head promoter lady prefers it this way!!  So
see y'all on the dance floor!!! :)
