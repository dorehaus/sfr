Subject: Re:  More thought

Well even though the rave scene is not overtly political... yet.
Please be assured that when the jessi Helms of the world become
aware of raves (If they already haven't) Right wing political
forces WILL be used to stamp it out.  Raves most likely scare
the shit out of these people, for the following reasons:

	1) People are having too much fun
	2) Raves tend to bring up tribal/goddess/shaman/whatever
	   energies that are consider pagan and therefore anti
	   christian, and are leading "our" youth down the path
	   to satan.
	3) All kinds of "perversions:)" like race/class/gender
	   mixing go on at raves.
	4) Raves by there very nature are anti-authoritarian
	5) People might start to think and feel for themselve
	   (the main fear here being youth) and these thoughts
	   might not be wholesome (read: accepted heard mentality
	   do what your told)

Look at the RAP scene which started TOTALLY underground in the
black ghettos of NYC (I lived in Bed-Stuy in the 70's). At first
it was ignored, then degraded, when it started getting political
with because of groups like PE, Boggie-down productions, XX-clan
etc. an attempt was made to stop or inhibit it. (What happens
when your 14 year old white, midwestern son starts to look up to
someone like Chuck-D or even worse ICE-CUBE or EASY-E!, or even
worse your 13 year old daughter has fantasies about LL-COOLJ!)
Finally, when all else fails, it can be co-opted, "refined",
declawed,etc enter Vanilla-Ice, Markie Mark, etc.

THIS COULD HAPPEN TO THE RAVE SCENE IF WE LET IT.

The only reason rap remained a social force (as well as entertainment)
is that the artists and producers realized what they were up against
and took steps to head it off, including appearing on Donahue and
Opra :). No I'm NOT saying that DOC MARTIN or BUCK or GARTH should
appear on Opra but we should be ready when the media-hype starts, as
it most certainly will.

"You don't have to lure someone to dallas and put him in a slow
motorcade anymore, a bimbo/stud in a hotel room with a camera
will do just fine"

Sorry this comes so late... I'm hoping that, if there are people tuned in who
are from Seattle and Portland, they can benefit from this.

Okay, what's going down in Portland:

A struggling rave scene, it seems.  Among the invites I picked up:
"Revenge" which was March 28.  Huge, full color card advertising "techno and house
house grooves to your cerebral erotic zones".  In case it's recurring, here's
the phone number:  (503) 299-LOVE

I also saw a flyer for "Reed College presents a rave called Queen".  No phone
number, but the event is April 4 and sponsored by the Reed College Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Union, or something to that effect.

Clubs:  the Lotus Cardroom (scenes from _My Own Private Idaho_ were filmed
upstairs) has a "techno house" thursday mix.... well, it was alright.  Not
particularly cutting edge, though.  Maybe it got better later (we had to
leave early).  932 SW third 227-6185.

Good place to pick up invites:  The Ooze:  2190 West Burnside (503)
226-0249.  They also have an excellent selection of techo CD's and LP's.

Next:  Seattle

the University of the Pacific in Stockton.  It's outdoors in a tennis court/

it.  So--as much as can be expected from a Uni. mini-Rave should be 
expected.  The DJ we are working with has worked with Horizontal Productions
at their Van Gogh Rave.  HP also did the Liquid Palace.

Raves are about entertaining people and keeping the people running them from
being homeless by making their rent. All else is marketing glam designed
to appeal to their audience.

Punk music didn't have self-concious posturing. It was a bunch of
unemployed kids having fun. Must we burden ourselves with deep
meaning philosophy already when the fun's barely started?

Plus, our generation only arises in the media as it is to be bashed
for our naivety. "They're too spoiled and naive to want jobs. They
*enjoy* living with their parents because they're *lazy* and don't
want to work or earn the qualifications. They *want* us to control them and
*enjoy* only being given a choice between voting for one or another of two
old guys." say the baby boomers.

Claiming to to have the power to solve the worlds problems by merely 
playing loud trance music late at night, well... isn't that what the crystal
heads claim to do by sufi dancing? Something tells me it'll be a similar
big failure.

(But if one wanted to claim that the people who solve or will solve the
worlds problems come together in their time off to have fun at raves,
that's an entirely different thing.)

Actually, my goal right now in life is to get a bunch of people in
Malcon "X" and Baltimore "O"rioles hats, and have a big game of
tic-tac-toe on the dance floor.

Supposedly in the late 70's (or early 80's ?) Somebody

story is. They managed to pre-empt or at least interpose their
charecter generator with the said message over a substantial
part of the UK.  I know that this happened, whether it came from
the "mothership" is another question.  Any Brits out there who
can share some light on this story or add corrections?

The sci-fi tip is the one thing I (sort of) like about Toon Towns.
It's good enterntainment as far as it goes, tho standing in line for
45 minutes for a glimpse of "virtual realty" is not all that uplifting.

>   Now, if this is on some level a serious statement, then does it define a

I don't think it's really a cold joke, maybe a 1/2 baked one.  The
positive-UFO myth is a nice way to get in some good whacks at the existing
social order. Anybody see "the Day The Earth Stood Still"? Liten up.


Rave "philosophy" seems a bit like Rastafarianism; not entirely serious,
not entirely phony either.  The effect on "real social ills" is second order;
what do we do  between raves, and how does that body/mind/spirit lift 
affect our attitudes and decisions?   Same goes for political rap. 


...... and George F. McQuary sez:

>Raves are about entertaining people and keeping the people running them from

Yeah, but marketing hype based on some ill-defined but real feelings.

>Punk music didn't have self-concious posturing. It was a bunch of

Oh, really?  I remember an *awful* lot of ink being spilled about
neo-nihilism, how the Clash was "The only band that matters ... ",
the plusses and minusses of Sid clones, is punk proto-nazi,
is slam-dancing inherently sexist, &c., &c.  The posturing was well
under way before the first US releases of UK groups recycling US
attitudes were on the first college radio turntables.

	Bad news first - no Techno Attack tomorrow. Apparantly the trade-off 
of getting the ultra-cool timeslot of 3-5:30PM on Fridays was that we'd be 
preempted by sports more than a coupl of times; so we're off for the next
two weeks, and then we shall return the 17th, hopefully with Doc Martin. I
will tape the show, and gladly copy it for anyone who makes it easy for
me.....

	Good news: I got the order in for the buttons today, and should have
a bunch of them at Time vs. Body. I think the best place to keep them will
be near the DJ table, since Peter's DJing, and I'll be hanging around
there, too, so we can make sure non-sfravers don't get their grubby hands
on them. I ordered 50, and will be giving 20 to Bob (rpcaras@srv.pacbell.com),
who'll have them at "Small" Saturday night. So, you have 2 chances to get
them. I'll be making more if the demand's high. And, if you pick one up,
try and keep it - they weren't a dime a dozen, so to speak. But, they will 
look great. They're 2 1/4" wide, essentially a yellow-gold happy face (with
X's for eyes), and "SFR" across the front in a very readable font. Took me
forever to find a place that didn't want a week to do it or $2.50 each...

	Also, will "UFO's are Real" be 21+? I know most Toon Town events are,
but I figured since this would be at a different location...

	See you all at T vs. B! I'll be the 5'10" blonde in... um... boy, do

Namely, will there be "in-and-out" priveleges (as it were) at
ToonTown and the Gathering?  This would make things a lot easier for
those of us planning to check out both of these landmark events.
If not, we'll be forced to figure out exactly what time to abandon
one and commit the rest of the night to the other.

I'll call the Gathering people and see what they have to say.  If
anyone is on good terms with any ToonTown insiders (Mr. Jesse?),
please check it out and report back to us.

Keep it flexible!

there wil be a rave oriented event at the kresge college town hall
here at ucsc on 4.18.92, a saturday.  visuals will moist likely come
from my group weird.blinking.lights.  (prepare to wobbleize!)

after like 7 or 8 on saturdays you usually need permission to get onto
campus.  have a ucsc pal call you in, or try riding the bus or shuttle 
from the base of campus (bay and high streets.)  or you could get here
early and start your *experience* by wandering around in these here weird 
woods for a while- kresge is built in the woods.  who knows, maybe you
will even find *elfland*.......

should be a cool event.  promoting off campus is discouraged, so you
diddn't hear it here.  i will double check to see that non-ucsc
phreaks will even be allowed, so more info will follow.

  	This message should read somewhere along the lines of the UCSC
one.
	A "RAVE-Type" event will be occurring at the University of 
the Pacific" on the 25th of April.  Our DJ, Larry, is doing Van Gogh's
Ear in Sac this coming Friday so you can check out his stuff at
that.  
Get there early, he's on first.  the number for that particular 
rave is 55-Venus, same as last time.
	At UOP, A Rave called Jack will provide an interesting diversion
for sleepy Stockton.  To get to the campus on I-5, take the Alpine/Country 
to the Pershing entrance of UOP and take a left before you enter campus
onto Pershing.  The tennis courts are located on Rosemarie Drive.  You 
make a right onto Rosemarie when the University townhouse sign comes up
on Pershing (first right possible).  Parking may be a bit sparse

viable.  
	From 99-take the Hammer lane exit and take a left onto
Hammer Ln.  Follow Hammer for quite a while and make a left onto 
Pershing.  from Pershing you'll amke a left onto Rosemarie and the 
Courts will, obviously actually, be on the rt hand side.

Hello, Ravers!
	This is but a simple request.  I was at the rave party on Jessie St. 
last Saturday and while I met quite a few people, I did not get a chance to 
interact with one particularly desirous young lady.  I hope that someone can 
help me by either giving her my email address or advising her to come to the 
next rave so that I can 'shoot the giff'.  SHE WAS: an extremely attractive
Asian girl with long, black, curly hair, an agile and seductive dancer, about 
5'5", and wearing a gold/earthtone-colored one-piece suit.  
	Somebody have compassion on my poor, infatuated soul and help me make 
a rendezvous with this dream.

Thanks

I believe that circa 92 gives a couple dollar discount to people

tickets up there

One note for anyone who gets a break and ends up in the LA area
Ron D Core is one of the best DJ's i have ever seen
and he left yesterday morning for England to be with his wife
Soo.... if you see fliers with his name on it
(Like Spring BreakDown) they are lying...
if they lie about that, what else might they lie about???
Spring Break Down seems pretty safe because it is so big and it
is associated with a radio station, but just a warning

also on that note...  i was told by a pretty big promoter down here
that it is unlikely that moby would be performing anywhere in California
next weekend, so he might not be at toon town
i dont know how reliable they are, but he told me to call moby's agent to
make sure

Mr. Gibson's idea of Virtual Reality has not been realized.  Cyberspace does
not exist.  Perhaps it never will.  So why is the terminology invented by Mr.
Gibson (a man who has no real technical knowledge) more valid than made-up
terms like "Ultra-Cyber-Orbit"?

Subject: KFJC "rave-type" :-) music on thursday night


So I'm sitting at home (doop-de-doop-de-doo), being a good boy and nursing
a cold while doing some compuhacking. Turn on the radio and they're playing
pretty good techno/house/acid-house/whateverthefuckyoucallit music.

I don't know if this is a regular thing, but I thought I'd post a lamo
review just incase they're on next week.

Belladonna 10-12 (??) -- was playing the more strident, depressing, angry-
sounding techno style stuff. No bouncy happy whistle-blowing stuff, but
that would belie her DJ-name -- Belladonna -- which is de-rigueur mortis.
Same lack of message as the other stuff, but it is somewhat cathartic to
wallow in a vat of piss shit jizz phlegm and bile every once in a while,
no?  If you go to "Drug #6" Thu nite @ 650 Howard, they play this kinda
music -- I just listen to it on the radio so I don't have to deal with
attitude poseurs.

Adonis 12-2AM -- played more dancy and bouncy stuff I've heard bits n'
pieces of at raves like Woopy Ball, Esta Loca, Sharon, the Gathering, etc.
And yes, they even played Kick Like a Mule's "The Bouncer" so now I know
what y'all is talking about.

KFJC is the Foothill College radio station @ 89.7 FM.  Cool thing is that
even though I live in a non-happening part of San-FranDisco (Glen Park) I
can get that most-excellent station.

Hasta la Rave-E-Ole' ... or as "they" say, Keep it loose, but don't step on it.

Subject: Early poll results

As in real life, I will now report early results in the ToonTown/Gathering
shoot-out, cavalierly neglecting any possible effect this may have on
the ultimate outcome  =)

With 20 votes in, it's looking like a landslide for the Gathering.
The breakdown is as follows:

	11	Gathering only
	3	Gathering and maybe ToonTown
	3	Both
	2	ToonTown and maybe Gathering
	1	ToonTown only

Counting each "definite" (or probable) as 1, and each "maybe" as 1/2, the
combined vote is:

	18	Gathering
	7.5	ToonTown

This result probably testifies to the fact that the average sfravers member
is fairly deeply into the scene, and that the Gathering is the one the
insiders will attend to avoid the "amateurs" (for lack of a more tactful
term).

I should mention that I've yet to hear from the following sfraves regulars:

	Chris Beaumont
	Aaron Cooley
	Brian Bisson
	Arthur Chandler
	Dan Trocha
	Niels Mayer
	Jeff Wong
	Paul Rossiter Joyce
	Joel (jenos@uop.edu)

Of course, you lurkers are more than welcome to vote too (I thought
the list has over 150 subscribers...)

My e-mail account at work is a bit slow:  if you haven't expressed your
vote yet, please send it to this account <mcg@netcom.com>, so I'll
receive it and post the final tally by 8pm this evening.

Best comment received so far:

"Definitely the Gathering... Toontown just sounds too huge and scary for
words."

Keep it anarchic!

Ive been hearing unsubstantiated rumours all day that TT will be

and- don't know how true this is..that some of the event-
AGAIN-THIS IS UNSUBSTANTIATED-
may end before "infinity" ....

i.e. about 4 AM.

Don't know if this is true..but I did hear it from some Fashion Center
management types.

  Tell me it isn't true!! ven though I have been disappointed with
the way TT has been going recently. I still don't want to see something
like this happen.. Perhaps they will move some of the event (maybye
the later part) to 174 King St. that's my guess ...

Anyway- regardless of what happens.. it should be a hell of an evening!!!

	My apologies to anyone who went out of their way to try and see us in 
Sproul this afternoon - we found out from the guys at ToonTown that it wasn't
going to happen this morning at 10! Ugh. So now Billy and I look like the
major flakes.... we'll make it up to you by....
	...having Doc Martin on our show next Friday! It's set, well, as
set as anything in this business can be (I know we don't have much of
an impressive track record here :). He'll either bring in a tape of some
of his mixes, or he'll be DJ'ing in the studio, but either way we'll get a
taste of his expertise. We encourage anyone within listening range to
tape it; we will be adding "KALX Berkeley" over every 3rd or so song, but
other than that it should be cool. I will be taping it myself, so I'll
figure out how much to charge if anyone wants copies in the next week or
so. 
	I've decided not to go to Mexico next weekend - I've only found
one other person interested, and I found a bad prediction of the event
on alt.rave (included after this f.y.i), and I've got a bunch of
committments the next week I should get ready for. Oh well. The full
moon rave on the 16th and Sharon on the 18th should be enough.
	Finally, about UFO's - I'll be there sometime after 2, wearing my
button. If you see me, or anyone else there with a button, come up,
introduce yourself, and ask if we have any extra. I'll try and be next to
the "smart drink bar" (assuming there's only one) around 3. Also, if
Toon Town's a bust, or it closes at 4, I'm heading across the street to
the Gathering. There will be people from the list at the Gathering with
extra buttons, too. 
	I guess that's it for now... cya

Yes "Spring Breakdown" will take place in San Filipe (sp?) on April 16-17-18.
808 state has been dropped, but they still have moby, fierce ruling divas,
guru josh, joey beltram and others.  I talked to the guy doing the 
visuals for it (Brad Baker).  He says there are like 100,000 students there
on that weekend, and what they are hoping is that they will see this
huge tent with booming bass and go check it out.  What does this mean?
It won't be a normal rave, with everyone dressed up ravey and on x and
stuff.  It will probably be just average college students who have
been drinking a lot.  Oh, it would still be fun, but I wouldn't make a road
trip out of it or anything.  If I happened to be in San Filipe, I would
deffinately go.

This is typical of how most mexico raves were, including Baby X and Joy: more
like a TJ club than a SoCal rave.

Only a few more votes have trickled in as of now (8:15pm Friday), so
here it is:

        12.5    Gathering only (includes one "maybe")

        5       Both
        2       ToonTown and maybe Gathering
        2       ToonTown only

The composite results of 25 sfravers:

        21.5    Gathering
        10.5    ToonTown

Proving that sfravers prefer the Gathering by a ratio of 2:1!

And this just in from a most reliable source:  ToonTown *will*
end at 4am.

Whatever happens, go with it and have FUN!

Subject: Finale Gathering, UFOs are Real

Being a complete amateur to raves and having nothing to compare it to,
I found this morning's gathering great.  I wish I had taken my X while
I was there -- the people running that show really know what it is
that needs to be done (and not done).  They obviously put their hearts
into it like nothing else I've quite seen yet (see below).  I got the
sense that there had been better raves in the past.  I left feeling
like I had missed out on something, and was quite happy.  The energy
was quite good, etc. but lacked a certain friendship that I expected
was possible.  I left feeling like the place was run by people.

Since I attended both raves on that block, I can compare them.
ToonTown's UFOs are Real had many flaws that made me disappointed with
the complete picture about it; it had the feeling that half of it had
been censored, not a feeling I like.  The lights were more of a laser
show variety there than the L&F Gathering, and were pretty good when
someone bothered to run them well.  The stage performance was pretty
dazzling to me since this was when I was tripping on X.  The general
atmosphere was really great, but that only compared to normal day to
day life, I can't say it was what it could have been since there was
this contingent of alcohol drinkers (everyone without X I think) which
nerved me -- sort of ruined the place for me.  I left feeling like the
place was run by a business.

I know what made it really fun were the few times someone would extend
their feelings toward me positively in a way not often found on the
street (or in the work place for those cursed to work in such awful
places as I work!).

In retrospect, this was all definitely worth it for me.

I'll have to jot down the artists from the Gathering list and watch
for their names in the future.  Toon Town had some good people too.  I
wish their setup had been better though.

Does anyone know what is happening with the experience the Gathering
people have collected?  Will it be achieved again?  Can it?

Now that I live in the city, I hope I can find out about some treasure
hunt rave parties, while I learn to ration my intake of substances.

See you 'round!

Well, it certainly isn't unique to The Gathering.  Last night's Gathering
was definitely a very good rave, but I've been to better ones (The Whoopi
Ball).

> Will it be achieved again?  Can it?
Yes.  Yes.

Also, regardless of the fact that that was The Final Gathering, the people who
run The Gathering (or at least most of them) will continue to put on raves.
They just won't be using the Gathering name anymore.

an excellent rave.  this was almost the ideal rave location - only the
presence of carpet on the main dance floor detracted.  otherwise, the
huge space was put to good use - lots of room to wander.  like a huge
psychedelic playground.

my major complaint is that the DJs were, on the whole, crap.
technically they were fine but the music selection was disappointing.
even the appearance of my current favorite song was a bummer - they
played a rather poor mix that totally failed to excite me.

still, the crowd was pretty good and the population density was near
optimal.  i just wish it wasn't $17 to get in!!

WEll, This weekend started with me plunking down $23 at a BASS node for
a ticket to UFOs are real, I thought that this would be a good idea so I 
could avoid the long lines that I thought would be in front of the fasion
center.  I spent most of the day doing taxes and getting ready for the
evening.
 When I got to SOMA, the Gathering was in full effect!  They had some
speakers set up outside of the entrance so that you could hear the mix
on the main floor, this really psyched me up for what was to follow.
I arrived at about 11, made a quick tour of the interior to get a good
"feel" for the space (and to know where the essentials like restrooms,
water, chill-out rooms, etc. were) and then proceeded to get into the groove.
After about an hour and a half, I decided that I should either go check
out UFOs or sell my ticket.  I tried to go get stamped but discovered that
IN-OUT was being suspended for "a few minutes", this "few minutes" turned
into more like an hour, which was very annoying, I didn't like the security
people very much but more on that later.  I finally did get stamped, and
went down the street to UAR.  I went to the entrance and saw a lot of
women in a lot of high-heels and make-up, I started to have a bad feeling 
about this rave, I suspended judgement and went to the entrance, the vibe
didn't feel right and then I saw the "NO IN - OUT" sign and that cinched
it. If I had to go to only one rave that night, I would return to the
Gathering.  So I stood out front and sold my ticket to a teenage woman
for $15.  There were two guys selling some tickets they had bought when they
heard that Markie Mark (who they thought was Marky Mark, the rapper) was
going to be there, needless to say they were disappointed.  So back
to The Gathering, which I was happy to reenter $15 richer.  Eventhough
I had fun, there was something missing, I saw plenty of regulars for my
own personal "rave pod" but the energy (Or maybe it was just MY energy) was
not quite right.  As I was standing in line to go to the bathroom, a bunch
of big yellow-jacketed security guys came up and went into the mens room,
it seemed that some pragmatic women who decided that it was stupid to wait
in an incrediblly long line to go into the women`s room when the men's room
line was short and moving quickly, hadf taken advantage of the situation,
these guys came supposedly because "the girls using the men's room was making
some guy act crazy" a couple of us told them that it wasn't the fault of
the women and maybe the "guy" WAS crazy. I didn't see any of the women get
hassled by any men or hassle anybody, It seemed to me that this was some
for of censorship or at least "liestyle management".  The mix on the main floor
was good but I never got truely inspired as at some raves.  I didn't feel the
Kundalini rise up my spin as it at Woopy Ball or at Time vs. Body last week.
I started to get tired around 4 am and eventhough thousands of peole were around me dancing, I felt strangely alone. I left about a half hour later
which is early for me.  All in all, this was my first and, I'm told my
last Gathering.  I can see how previous Gatherings could have had the
potential to be wonderful experiences but I have to admit that I had more
fun at Time vs. Body then at the Gathering, I think the size had something
to do with it.  The Gathering was NOT, intimate, as the Woopy Ball was
there were lots of people but It was hard to connect, it was too dark
to really see anyones face.  I thought the acoustics might have had something
to do with it as well.  

What does anyone else think?  Maybe it just me.  I'm looking forward to the
Full Moon.  I hear that the acoustics for the longshoreman's hall are
pretty lame as well, hope this doen't put a damper on Electric Jellyfish.

Subject: Gathering my thoughts

Wow!  That was quite a night Saturday, wasn't it?

We had advance tickets for ToonTown, but we arrived later than we'd
planned.  By the time we showed up, there were maybe 150 people
queued up to get into the Gathering, and they were blasting the
music from inside out into the street.  Clever touch!  There was
almost no line at ToonTown -- we took one look at each other and
said, "Let's bail!"  So we sold our tickets at only slightly under
face value (the deal almost fell through -- the buyers questioned why
we only wanted to go to the Gathering; I had to assure them that
ToonTown had the top notch DJ's...)

The sound in the main room was incredible!  One of the cleanest
sound systems I've heard, and this hadn't been the Gathering's
strong suit in the past.  Unfortunately, the amp in the Groove
Room kept overheating and blowing an internal circuit breaker,
causing a five or ten minute gap in the music every hour or so.
It was bizarre to see the nearly full room empty out within seconds
when the sound went off, and refill just as quickly when it started
again.  Not the usual constant continuity of mix one's accustomed to these
days, but all credit is due to DJ Magic D who kept it all going, playing
great tracks all night while alternating with other DJ's such as
Bones and Harry Who.

But this technical glitch proved to be a blessing in disguise, as DJ Thomas,
originally slated for the Groove Room, instead spun a kicking one hour set in
the Main Room.  This was his last gig before departing for England "real soon",
but he assured me he'll be back in SF at some point in the future.

In terms of propagating the experience of the organizers, unfortunately
1/3 of that experience (Tony) is moving to Stockholm, where it will no doubt be
applied in some form.  Another 33% (Ken) co-produces an occasional South Bay
rave called "Destiny", and the remaining portion (Martin) used to produce
Eklyps.  A former fourth co-conspirator runs a nifty event called "Come-Unity"
about once a month at 1015 Folsom.  So as Mike W said, the energy will
continue in some mutated form.

God bless those who Gathered, and especially those who gave us the chance
to.

Were the people who were complaining about ToonTown at the same event I
was? In spite of all the trouble they had because of the rain I felt the
event went smoothly and professionally. The sound system was great, the
music was outstanding. Moby kicked ass. Joey Beltram was great. The person
who said Joey Beltram was a no-show was wrong. His time slot was 3:00 -
4:30 or so I believe. And to the person who thought it ended at 4:00, where
you there? It ended at 6:00. I got to meet Genensis and Paula (of PTV),
Maruga the drummer was there as well. We knew so many people there that for
us it was like a private party.
There were some shirts and ties there but they didn't stick around all
night. It was funny when I overheard some rave-types heckle some of the
shirts with "Hey, aren't you in the wrong place? You look like you should
be at DV8." I would say there were more rave-types than shirts and ties.
Alot of the "old" Toontown regulars where there.

The after party at 177 Townsend was a blast. Jan Cooley played some kickass
tunes and it was definately a hardcore rave crowd.

I thought the music sucked hard till about 3-4AM, when it even became real
good on the main dance floor. IMHO, same thing happened at the last
Gathering.  After a while, I retreated to the "little room" where they were
playing a different kind of rave music whose name I simply can't describe.
Sounded a bit more like old "balearic beat", with this trippy carnival
calliope happyness about it (or maybe it was just me). Unfortunately, the
amp kept on overheating and shutting down, which kinda put a damper on
things.

I really like raves with multiple dance floors because I enjoy freedom of
choice, and because I don't always enjoy listening to the same kind of
music for hours on end ... Woopy ball was paradise in that respect.

There's this one song that I keep on hearing at raves that I really like.
It's got this simple loping reggae bass-line and this trippy echoized
ethereal sounding choral fringe on top.  Guess I have to go to BPM and try
to figure out what it is.  They were playing it on the "big floor" round
3:30 AM.

Anybody care to venture a guess... Pretty vague, huh?

PS: It was good to finally meet a number of sfraves denizens.

I went to both ToonTown and the Gathering, and I vastly preferred the  
latter. ToonTown was too big, too open, and too soft (also, not loud  
enough, but that would be bad parallel structure). I felt like I was  
in a huge shopping mall that had turned into a yuppie dance bar /  
fashion show. Which I was... The lasers were very psychedelic,  
though-- even better through the kaleidoscopes I brought along.

As regards the P-Orridges, they are indeed in town, and will be  
DJ'ing at an invite-only gig at the venerable Flophouse this Friday.  
A full-scale rave is in the works for May-ish (or early June).

The good folks at Ameba on the Haight are the best source of further  
info (and possibly Floppy's invites).

Stay tuned...

Gregg Taylor's "A Rave Called Raw" is not going to be so much a rave as it
will be a hack of a rave.  Gregg is a "personality" in the SF gay community who
throws big parties in his warehouse abode.  His last party, "Raw Meat," was
big, but very un-rave-like.  It will certainly be fun, but don't expect a rave!

I forgot to mention, Michael Blue is one of the DJs at Club Uranus (End Up,

spins at Fusion (Thursdays at the Oasis in SF, another queer club).  Michael
Blue spins a mix of hard fusion and everything from trash 70's disco to Elvis
Presley to anything verging on the bizarre.

He's also better known as the Mike half of "Mike and Lewis," if that rings a

Eila Ravers!

	This is a quickie from the UCD workaholics.  There have been a number of 
articles about Raves in the Bay Area and in Sacramento (I don't know if other 
papers in So. Cal. have also published articles on Raves) as well as T.V. specials.
The general public's conception of Raving as derived from the media rather than 
personal experience is puzzling to me.  Perhaps it is just the mentality here in 
Davis, but, when one mentions raving here it is a taboo, drug-ridden perversion.
I know there are rave-type clubs (ToonTown etc., ) but this is (I feel) differ-
ent than the underground scene.  On the other hand, the proliferation of flyers 
makes raves more and more accessible to the skeptical and I am wondering if the
underground "family" scene is headed for irreversible demise, in other words, 
towards total commercialization.  I'd hate to see the good feelings for the 
music and dancing degenerate into just 'another pop thing'.  
	Does anyone have comments on the future of Raving in light of all of the
media attention?

	And incidentally, does anyone have any word on the upcoming full moon 
rave--where, when, how much?

Tragically, I think you're right. As raving grows and gains popularity, the
illegal aspects of the scene will certainly be cracked down upon and whats
left of it will go mainstream. That means alcohol, and clubs which will
whatever's left of the 'community' feeling found in the scene today.

Hopefully, a bit of rave philosophy will find its way into mainstream culture,
so it won't be a total waste and, hopefully, another underground culture just
as good will rise to take the place of raves. But raving as it currently 
exists is doomed. I give it 6 months, tops.

Enjoy it while it lasts.

Subject: future of raves

When greeted with skepticism about the future of raves one must keep
in mind that disco never died out, it simply deviated from the main-
stream and was kept alive primarily through the gay club scene.  House
music gained its roots from the disco era and the birth of modern house
can indeed be traced back to the year 1987 when Detroit artists were
at work reviving the scene.  Suddenly, everyone was grooving to a tune
by MARRS and a quick beat by S'EXPRESS.  Unfortunately, this is not
New York and clubs are not the fountainhead of the dance movement.
Raves will go underground again, which as people have noticed, is 
going about now.  Hardcore Techno is already fading fast in England
where a new sound called Jersey Techno is taking over.  House music
is reemerging, listen to Wishdokta "Bannana Sausage" 12".  The main-
stream raving will cool off, in time, but if the past is any indication,
the scene will only evolve - not dispense.

Your true about the flyers.  I saw alot of flyers on tables at Toontown, where it is 
accessible to those who are in suits and ties.  I even saw a bunch of Rave Called Sharon
flyers on the floor.  So watch out ravers, the DV8 crowd are coming!

what a perfect time for sfravers to get together and meet!
the place is small enough to rally hang out.  there are acres

I think you just answered your own question.  Certainly the media hype will
affect the rave-type clubs (e.g., Toon Town), but the underground rave scene
-- the rave family -- will survive and grow.  Raves like the full moon rave and
Preston's rave last Friday (meet at Zanzibar at 2:00) will continue to exist
and no one who stumbles into Toon Town and picks up a flyer will find out about
them.  However, the big media hype will draw potential rave family members into
the fold and the underground scene will grow.  People who find the rave
community and attitude at Toon Town and who want to join in the scene (not just
sit and drink and watch people dance) will add life to the movement.

I think it definitely is a movement.  Apart from the obvious capitalistic
reasons for the Toon Town promoters to promote in the mainstream press, I think
they wanted to "spread the gospel" a bit.  It backfired, but there was a
definite infusion of new faces into the hard-core rave scene.  Doc Martin has
been talking about holding a weekend-long ravfe out in the desert near Palm
Springs sometime soon.  He wants to get 10,000+ people there, like some of the
raves we hear about in the UK and Tokyo.  Without educating the public about
what raves are, we're never going to get that many people together in the
desert for a real rave.  It'll be just a big drinking party, like the thing in
San Felipe.

Anyway, that's just my view of the whole situation.

On a similar note, I think the Gathering on Saturday was going down the same
path that Toon Town went down.  There were definitely lots of people there who
were new to the rave scene, but fortunately, it seemed like a lot of them were
getting into it.  I was disappointed in the light show, but the music was
danceable.  The space could have used some improvements, too, like defined
walkways around the dance floor.  There were so many people just traipsing
through the dancers that it got to be a bit annoying.  I just went to teh back
of the room where there was little traffic and had more fun.  I was looking for
SFR buttons, but didn't see any.  Hopefully I'll be able to get one soon and
meet all of you, too!

Share and enjoy,

My personal opinion on the sellout-dieout raves matter--
--a) ToonTown is about as rave as ClubX or some other cheese-club, due
to inpart people sitting around, looking bored and not adding to the atmosphere
--b) the downfall of raves is ecstasy--the ignorant of the rave philosophy
view raving as popping E--i know hippie-types that claim to be ravers even though they hate the music--they just like the drug-- i think E is an essential
part of the scene--but it is meant to heighten the experience, not create it
--c)there are those that believe in the movement that is afoot, and as long
as there is a group devoted to this belief, then the true rave will live........................just a thought ........dr.seuss

Subject: Ah, finally!


	Yes, yes, yes, I know the calendar is three days late. You can blame
the University Housing and Dining Services for its wonderful phone system.
"Uh, hello? My phone line is incredibly noisy, as if someone keeps picking
up and putting down a reciever or something, and it's causing my computer
conection to be absolutely unbearable". "Can you make calls out?" "Yes, I
can." "Well, there's not much we can do, if it's actually working."
AAARRRGGGHH!! It got really bad when I would be working on an object-
oriented environment in scheme for CS homework, and some line noise would
kick me out of the scheme shell, wiping out about an hour spent getting the
environment variables just right. I'm thinking about connecting the phone
leads to the wall jack, and giving them another call....

	Anyway, I'm babbling. The calendar is here. 

	"You're name's not down, you're not coming in" was heard on Saturday
night outside of ToonTown for me, which is a good thing since the Gathering
was really fun. I really liked the lighting (who was the genius who came
up with projecting three images of the earth on a 20-foot globe suspended
above the dance floor?), and the people were really into it. We left around
6:30, I guess, and the dance floor was still rather packed. We passed Toon
Town on the way to the car, and it was QUIET. Not a soul to be found....
It was also lots of fun meeting everyone from the list, passing out buttons,
etc. (there still are a few left, and I won't be making another batch for
a while, unless there's more interest.) The other non-list people at the
gathering did seem a little less mellow than at other raves I've been to,
a lot less willing to be friendly and talk and such, but I guess that's a
factor of its size.....

	Which brings me to a question - many times raves seem to lack a
way for people to "connect", to meet others. It would be nice if there were
some way at the rave for people to be unafraid to talk, to lose their fear
of strangers, etc. So far the only tangible thing out there that does this
is X. I'm not talking about making it easier for guys to "pick up" on
girls at these events - I'm thinking more along the lines of something, say
for example, virtual reality - that could be so set up as to allow two
complete strangers to get a sense of each other. Or more than two - if we could
get a whole crowd of people into this, that would be fantastic. Something
akin to field trips I used to take in high school to Yosemite - by the end
of the week there, we were not only good friends, we were _close_. We
understood each other, more or less. Any preconceived ideas had fallen away - 
those who we thought were "stuck up" or "phony" or "geeky" turned out to be
fantastic individuals. That took a week; perhaps to expect something
even close to that to occur in the space of a night might be pushing things,
but I feel it does fit into the sense of community we as ravers often feel.
Has anyone seen, or can anyone think of, anything that could facilitate this
objective? I would like to see computers used here, too.  At the Woopy Ball,
in the "chill out" warehouse, I saw few things that were leaning in that
direction, like the lounges (which made people very relaxed and easy to talk
to) and the computer link they had over 101 Online. Any others?

	Oh, I had a chance to do an interesting experiment on Saturday night
before the Gathering. I had volunteered to DJ a boat dance for my dorm here
a couple of months ago, long before I had known it was going to be battle of
the rave giants that night. Other members of the "committee" organizing the
dance gave me a huge list of "must-plays" - mainly rap and slow songs, and
the more popular stuff like Nirvana, and typical party songs like "What
I Like About You", etc. They let me borrow CD's and tapes of those songs I didn't h
didn't have. Anyway, the dance was four hours long, and they gave me about
2 hours worth of requests, so guess what I did for the remaining time? Yup,
pommeled them with as much techno as I could. And, they reacted surprisingly
well to it. I stayed pretty much to the more popular songs, like Cubic 22
(they _loved_ it, I played the Art of Mix version), LA Style, etc. The
most obtruse I got was Gateway Experience's Twin Freaks, which I mixed into
Go (woodtick mix) by Moby, into the Rainforest mix of the same song, into
"Xeroxed" by Zero Zero. They danced to it all. My mixing abilities were
weak, mainly because I haven't DJ'd a dance in a long time, and I only had
5 minutes to learn my way around the mixer before the dancers were arriving.
Like I said, I was surprised by how well the music was recieved, and I knew
hardly anyone on the boat even knew that "techno" was a style of music before
then. I'm probably the only DJ in the world to have ever mixed from "James
Brown Is Dead" into "What I Like About You" :).

on the future of raves:

seems right to me that an underground, hard core rave scene can persist.  the
underground may get some new faces, but those newcomers will have to work a bit
to *find* the underground.  that process will tend to filter out the non-raver
types.

speaking of events you probably won't get handbills for at toon town:

- the rave/BBQ in GG park was rained out last weekend and is rescheduled for
this coming sunday starting circa noon.  it's at Lindley Meadow, just north of

	I haven't had a chance to get up and write at all to get my name out

the rave we're planning to hold so time soon.  Well, I finally got around to
writing.  I have one major favor to ask of everyone...oh no you say!!
	Hey it ain't that bad, it just as of recent, I've been bagged on alot
by some friends for being into this scene.  Why, I don't know, I think they
think all we do is consume drugs all night and have non stop sex on the dance
floor.  They have never been to a rave, they will never go to a rave, so what
good argument do I have to get them off my back??  Seems stupid however I work
with them everyday and it gets hard sometimes to put up with the shit.  What
I need are some good lines to run by them to shut them up.  Thanks if ya have
some.  Oh, yeah, Brain, save me a pin, I'll be with Joel this weekend at as
many raves as possible!

hi y'all!
i also enjoyed the final gathering. it was a bit too big  for my tastes, which
made contact with people harder. there is an optimal size for a rave, not
too small to alck in energy and not too bid to be too fragmented. as for drugs,
ecstasy in particular, or acid, remember what r. a. wilson said :
anything which can be achieved with drugs can be achieved by other means.
i concur that x just adds to the experience, not create it. i thought that
rave is precisely this other means to achieve the trance state, with music.
rave on,

up to its initials, UC (Under Construction). Right now the center of campus
is being completely torn apart, so there's not too many places we could hold
a nice get together. We would want someplace semi-private, and nothing

I don't think you want to hold it in People's Park :) I vote for Golden

Well Unfortunately I missed out on the what is RGO (Really Going On)
last weekend. Do to the fact that, MY RIDE FLAKED! No hard feelings
to the ride person who also happens to be my household mate.

But as you have all said the Gathering was happening..
I went to a party up here on Fri nite and I ran into some people
who said they were going to the Gathering. My roomate has never been
to a rave before. He asked a certain individual about it. And what
this individual said might give a clue as to the bad publicity that
occurs about raves.

He said , "Oh yeah, I've been to lots of raves. YEah they are cool. Once I
saw this guy and chick just out on the floor in front of the board fucking
each others brains out. Then at another I saw this guy sucking this other
guys dick, in front of everyone. Wow it was incredible!"

The above is a toned down version of what was actually said. 
BUT YOU GET THE POINT!
If people , even us people into raves, describe it as that, then
we deserve the publicity we get. I still have yet to clue my roomate
into the fact that raves are not a sex-scapade or some other thing
...........

Well, I decided, I'll take my roomate to a rave to show him what
he can discover there..
Hopefully we will be able to make the Full moon Rave.

On a brighter note!
IF any of you ravers at UCDAVIS are raving a particular time.
LETS GET TOGETHER, CARPOOL, WHATEVER!
e-mail me or somehow get in touch!

See Ya

Subject: Smart bar mixes.

   BTW- if anyone's going into Ameba- they might want to look at my
smart drink mixes, which they're carrying. They cost about the same
per/serving, or maybye even a little less that the Smart Products/
Get Smart/LSS products, but they're far stronger and dont have caffeine,
artificial flavor or sugar, or ephedra.(they don't impart their own Tang
flavor to drinks.)  My formula is different too- less like the afore-
mentioned products in that I rely more on tyrosine and DLPA for my
catecholamine formula (more specific and effective) than plain l-phenylalanine.
(can sometimes make you cranky).
I also use pyroglutamate and DMAE in my cholinergic formula, which synergise
much more effectively with choline.
For someone looking to make their own smart drinks- not buying ..I'd recommend
the following formula. I feel an informed buyer base can only help the
business as a whole and keep inferior products from getting too much 
market share.

Cholinergic formula: (similar to my "Intellex")
Choline or PC. 1 to 2 gm.
L-pyroglutamic acid or arginine pyroglutamate 600 mg to 2 gm.
Vitamin B5 500 mg
DMAE 200 mg.

optional B12 (1000 to 3000 mcg.)
optional ginko biloba 24% standardized extract 40- 160 mg.
(don't use herb- ginko is very expensive and the extract is the only
decent ginko available in stores -very hard to find good quality)


Catecholamine formula (similar to my "Renew-You")
L-tyrosine (closest NE/DA precursor available legally) 1 to 2 gm.
DLPA (the D-form of phenylalanine has some interesting effects on enkephalins)
Small amount Vitamin B6
Vitamin C
no caffeine
no ephedra (which since it releases NE, only DEPLETES neurotransmitters...)

optional - dmae  (not a catecholamine precursor- but can help with the
peripheral systems that support the neurotransmitter conversion process..)

-----------

Good luck!

Now that summer is here, Golden Gate park will be getting foggy.  I live just a
block from GG Park in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood and last summer you could
just about count on fog every day.  It usually (but not always) clears up
druing the middle of the day, but it's cold and wet in the mornings and late
afternoons.  To be sure of nice weather, maybe the east bay would be better for
a picnic.

Speaking of Weather, Marin will probably be foggy tonight, too.  Any word on
the full moon rave location, or are they waiting to the last moment to
determine the weather conditions?  The first one I went to last summer was at a
picnic area near Candlestick Park.  Even though the beaches and the rest of the
city were shrouded in fog, this place was pretty clear.  Maybe they'll have it
back there...  (Just a guess!)  The only problem with this location was the
sprinklers that came on at 3:00am to water the grounds.  Fun, fun, fun!

Share and enjoy,

Hi ravers,

Tonight at Drug #6, 650 Howard St., S.F. at 9pm there is a lecture/video
presentation by Mark Pauline of Survival Research Laboratories (SRL).  They
are a performance art group that build these mechanical creatures that
interact and sometimes destroy each other. Sorta techno-robotic gladiators.
They had a performance last week in the city, which will be what the video is
all about.

So what does this have to do with raving?  Well, I recall reading in sfraves
about Drug #6 and I'm wondering if it will be worth hanging out for or if I
should just book it on over to the Full Moon rave.  If I was on my own I'd be
willing to just play it by ear but I'm riding up with a friend and they aren't
as spontaneous. 

Thanks in advance for any info, and I hope I've gotten a couple of people
curious about SRL. (Their phone 415-541-5687)

I'm definitely in favor of this.  GG Park would be nice, but I think I'm
leaning toward Mills or Tilden Park, for reasons of:  1) weather, 2)
more privacy, 3) scenery, 4) easier access for the East Bay/Davis/Stockton
posse.  Perhaps the next one can be in GG Park, or the Marin Headlands.

We should pick a date (first or second weekend in May?) and start
figuring out how to get a generator, sound system, and DJ (or do we
settle for a ghetto-blaster and tapes?)

Not a whole lot, IMHO.  SRL goes back at least to the early 80's, and is more
akin to punk or "industrial" culture than raving.  Well done, if you're into
that sort of thing.

If it starts at 9, though, you can easily do both.  The Full Moon's don't
get going before midnight anyway...

there are some anarchy/anything goes beaches up here that would be

with generators and full bands.  some distant corporation owns the
land, so the cops never come over the hill, and the corporation
could care less what happens there.  they probably dont really have
any concept of that beach, it's probably only a certain amount of
dollars in their net worth.

so lets party on it.

Subject: sfraves gathering




There has been quite a bit of discussion about arranging a picnic or even
a mini afternoon rave to bring sfraves together.  If we decide to make
it more like micro rave and tunes become essential, I would be willing
to bring the following:
  my 3 1200 turntables
  1 Numark mixer
  1 Carver PM 1.5 (380 wpc amp)
  and many cool techno and deep house tunes

With the addition of a generator ($25-30 bucks to rent), a pair of small 
speakers, a pair of subs (double 15's or single 18's), and a crossover
(oh yeah, and an extra amp) we would then have decent sound for an outdoor
event.  I wouldn't want to spin for more than about an hour and a half, so
we would need to scare up someone else to handle the vinyl if this was going
to last a while.

Anyway, just wanted to say that if there was interest, I was willing to 
help.

just got back from the full moon rave.  as it happened, the full moon was
hidden behind clouds, mist, and drizzle for portions of the night.  but we
*knew* it was up there and had a great time anyway.

tim estimates there were 250 or more cars there, which gives you an idea of the
number of people.  the police finally shut it down (gracefully, it seemed)
around 5:30.

i'm glad to have met a few sfravers tonight and we seem to be psyched for
continuing the trend.  so:

y'all are hereby invited to my place in SF this saturday at nine PM.  we can
hang out here for a while, then sometime after midnight folks can move on to
where the music will be louder.   sharon is one option on the calendar; i'm
kind of interested in checking out Carefree at 177 townsend.

but didn't get to stay too long since I had an early meeting today.
Everyone originally showed up in a parking lot behind these buildings which was a
great location but I guess the owners made it clear no partying was to be
done there.  The party then moved down the hill to the side of the
road.  I left before the music started (around 1:15) but it was still a
fun crowd (didn't see any SFR buttons.. oh well) - there were a lot
of people there for a word of mouth event.

I'll drink (sorry - wrong drug) to that !!  As an avid sfraves voyeur and part of the
small but fanatical bunch of SF expats in Austin, Texas, Im really hoping to use an
SF spark to generate a forest fire down here.  Lotsa good DJ's & music down here, but
the weekly techno/house nights are definitely not raves, and consequently haven't
generated much interest.

What is needed is a list of minimum criteria for a good rave, and steps to build from
there.  A sorta 'Anarchist Cookbook' of the rave scene.  Who knows, maybe there's a
product in this:  Mattels 'Junior Rave Kit' :-}

Sorry to pollute the crystal waters of Bay Area raving,

P.S. I hate to suggest that only certain ethno/geo/political groups are receptive to the
Rave, but the lack of any discernable reaction from the UT crowd to FUNKY house grooves
makes me wonder.

If anyone is interested, I can send them the story I posted to alt.rave about
doing our first (and so far only) rave, RAVE1.  In short, we lost money, it
was a big stressful hell, I DJ'd for seven hours straight, but we had fun.

Trying to put on the second one is a trick.  People are actually begging us to
do it again.  Locations are few and far between though.  I've called about 50
warehouse & location owners, and looked at about a dozen places with no
success.  We *might* have an airport hanger in June, but I'm not banking on
it.

Went with Brian from the list... we got there at about 1:30am and started
to take the road up the hill... began to giggle when we dodged all those
road construction signs that said "golf course vehicles only"

But we were even more amazed when we got to the top of the hill and saw how
many cars were parked alongside the road.  I would also estimate at least
200 cars were there and at least 500 people at 1:30, probably more.

It was too dark to see much... there were some people waving around bright
flashlights, and the van the DJ's were operating out of had a large strip
blacklight attatched to the top.  Lots of funny people... a guy with a large
dayglo cardboard lolly pop cutout on a long pole, someone with a wig with
glowing "eyeballs" or something attached to it, several people with "joker"
hats with bells... the energy was quite good.  A thumbs down to the people
who were parked on the dancefloor (dance earth?) drinking beer.

At 2am I took a rest and trudged up the hill to get a survey of the crowd...
the most amazing thing was that cars were coming continuously up the road
the whole time i was there.  The fog began to come in at this point, which
I thought was very refreshing although it must have been hell for the
DJ's.  Everyone was getting soaked but laughing.

We left about 2:45... as we were walking back to the car some guy came
up behind me, tapped on my shoulder, and wordlessly handed me a 
red rose.  Wow.

Music:  more deep house than techno.  A lot of good, old house songs.

For the picnic thang, I can help out deejaying - and for visuals, I can

p.s. Another possible location for an sFr party:  A club called 'Mr.Fives'
in SF.  If you don't know of it, it's a funk/soul/jazz club in a really
great space on Rose St. off Market.  I know the owners, & they hold private
parties on Fridays.  Is there interest in an SFRaves Friday night at MR5's?
 No promises yet, but I'll look into it.

The mist covered you just enough .. 
Unfortunately , I didnt see One Single SFR button.
Probably was bad luck since I forgot mine :)
The scene was friendly, and groovin to the tunes. 
This was my first Full Moon Rave, so I was kinda dissapointed about
the lack of a Full Moon. But hey cant have everything in life, CAN WE!


	There is one question which I would like to hear an answer for,

If you were there , did you notice all of the trash.. that was left around
What happens, does someone clean it up. I myself being very anal about

Hope someone out there can help me!

I've been hearing this song in some clubs lately but have not been able to 
find a copy of it anywhere, I dont know the singer/artist but have a good 
idea of the name of it.  It starts off with a woman singing :

'Now, is the time, to be free, from a world thats full of sin, to the sea (?), 
just a dream, the futures ???????? <- not sure of this bit.

A sax starts playing and then a guy starts singing :

'A dreams a dream, a dreams a dream'

The rest of the song revolves around these words, so I guess the song is 
called ' A dreams a dream ' No?

Any info on this would be well appreciated.

Thanks

Subject: Picnic


	Cheers to Mykl for suggesting that we hold one every couple of weeks
or so - that way we don't have to worry about pleasing _everyone_ or having
the _best_ time or location, we can be somewhat flexible. I'm totally in
agreement with that proposal.

	So to further this, let's make things a little more definite - the
weekend of May 2nd would be ideal for those of us in college. Andrea has
checked out Miller park, off the 13 feeway just south of Berkeley, and
says it's great for what we want. She's going to call a ranger to see about
sound levels, etc. She said there were very few people here today, Easter
Sunday, so theoretically there should be even less on a typical Sunday. A
few of us should go early to stake out a spot just in case. There's plenty
bathrooms. There are four picnic tables, and a bunch of 
"grassy knolls" all around (hey, no JFK impersonations, c'mon!). Assuming we
can have sound levels at a decent level (not rave-level, certainly, but enough
to dance to), that place should work out fine. If there's some problem with
the site the day we hold the picnic, the park is plenty big, if we can forgo
the BBQ pits....

	Okay, so now that the site is pretty much set, let's decide on whether
we want it on Saturday or Sunday. I would vote for Saturday, simply because this
event seems like a natural lead-in into a night of raving - the day after a rave
I'm usually running at 15% of capacity, if I'm not asleep. We could also use
the picnic as a site for carpooling for those who live in the East Bay. This
is open for discussion, but I would strongly urge Saturday. Also, if we can
arrange it for Saturday I can supply a free sound system (speakers+amp+mixer),
since my dorm will be having another dance that night that I've been coerced
into DJ'ing (don't worry, I'm charging this time :) and will be arranging the
rental of equipment for it. I can also conceivably bring my brand new used
1200's, but I don't have carry cases for them so I'd sorta prefer not to....

	Okay, now for food. It's kinda early to predict how many people will
show up, but judging from the outpouring of offers we've seen, I would
estimate around 30 at least. If people want to mail me personally about what
food they want to bring, I'm willing to organize that (also send me your
phone #). Postings to the net about what type of food people want should be
made, too - also, if we want to BBQ, would someone volunteer to be a 
"patty jockey", so to speak? We need drinks, too...

	Smart drinks? Hmm....

	Ideally, everyone would contribute _something_, no matter how small.

	As for spinning, I could bring a couple of 12"s, and a bunch of CD's
(and a good CD player, too.) Those who volunteered their DJ expertise, 
write me if you can still make the date/location.

	As the date approaches I'll give you all a bunch more info... 

	If you're pretty sure you can go, RSVP to me so we can get an idea
of how large this'll be. And, I think we should make this open to SFRAVERS'
family and friends, too, as long as they somewhat like the music (but not
too many - use your best judgement).

	This will be a VERY cool event. I think having the next one in 
GG Park is a good idea, too, and then hauling down to Santa Cruz after that
would be fun. 

	We are family......

Subject: Clubs cutting back...

    Just a little thought.
It's really striking how the near-demise of TT has left the techno-underground
clubs in SF with nothing interesting to carry on the "techno-playground"
concept that TT was originally supposed (and actually did a good job of doing-
until Jan/Feb or so..)to do.
   The concept was originally a good one- it just got hijacked by one
person's personal ego trip.
  I understand that that person is now gone, and the TT people have
to be commended for doing what had to be done.
  I have to say, if there is any single group that has people contained
within it that have the capabilities to have something REALLY interes-
ting rise from the ashes, it's people like us.
  This is a call for idea submissions- Do the people here really want
to do something interesting?
Now with no Gathering,and other clubs ending,there's a real possibilty
here.
  sfravers- what do you think ?
Summer is just beginning.

Subject: this weekend


I haven't seen anyone mention this past weekend's Sharon thing, so here's a
stab at it:

It was at Long Shoreman's Hall.  Neils said a while back that it would be a
challenge to have a decent sound system there because of the difficult
acoustics of the room.  The sound system was pretty decent -- not the best
I've ever heard, but it was definitely better than the one at One Step Beyond.
I had no complaints about it.

Anyway, we got there at midnight or so.  The place was incredibly packed and
very hot.  I definitely liked the Techno Salad Bar (a bowl of lettuce with
a sign that said "Help Yourself").

In one area there was an ultraviolet light and some paints, and people were
painting tribal patterns on themselves (which looked really cool in the UV
light).

The music was pretty good -- not great, but danceable.  There was a miked live
drummer playing along with the music.  It was a good idea, but it didn't really
add much to the music.  Maybe it would have been more effective if they had
hired a better drummer.

Around 2:30 the music stopped and they told everyone that the police would
like everyone to leave.  So everyone left.  I'm not exactly sure why the whole
thing got busted, but my best guess would be that it was because a) they were
way over capacity, by about a factor of 3, or b) the neighbors complained
about the noise and the people milling about outside.

I heard that most people went to Club O, and I later heard that Club O ended
up being incredibly packed (but fun nonetheless).  Neils, Jon, Pete and I
headed over to Care Free at Townsend.  DJ Markie Mark was spinning an amazing
techno set, and of course the sound system there blew away the Sharon sound
system.  And it was much less crowded at Care Free than it was at Sharon.
So the end result was that we had a much better time at Care Free than we did
at Sharon, so I'm actually kind of glad that Sharon got broken up.

But then, that's to be expected. For the brief time I had it on, that
C&C version of "In the name of love" was playing, and it basically
looked like Club MTV, except people were making trippy hand movements
and were dressed more fashionably. According to the commercial, Black
Sheep (the rap group) "performed." So, did anyone sit through it?
Did they play ANY legitimate techno? Is this some weird marketing plan

I had to go out to the FMR site the next night to help someone retrieve
her car (long story) and noticed that it was as clean as when the rave
started except for a couple of trash bags neatly piled up by the pre-
existing cal-trans garbage pile.|-)  Also, did anyone else from sfr
(I didn't see any buttons either) try getting inside the 7ft. long
plastic cal-trans tubes with about 3 or 4 other people and rolling down
the hill?  It was a blast!  One of the best sensory experiences I've had
in a looooong time.  Possibly worth setting up at other outdoor rave
events.  Actualy, the tube tried to come home with me the night I went 

back out there but wouldn't fit into my vw camper by about 3 inches.  A
good thing too, because on my way home my bus enging caught on fire 
coming over the bridge.  I had to keep driving until I was off the bridge
because it would have been more dangerous stopping on the bridge.  I pulled
over in crockett and called the fire dept.  During my telephone call the
bus became fully envolved and the magnesium metal in the engine itself
caught on fire.  It was like white hot flares falling down and burning
throught the asphalt.  Anyway, 3 fire trucks, two local police cars, one
highway patrol car, and one cal-trans truck came and managed to put the
fire out in about a half hour.  Needless to say, I'm sure they would all
have been wondering what the tube was doing in my car (except the cal-
trans dude, who would have known exaclty what it was and proabably where
I got it too). (Hey Taxi, What's up?)            Rave on.

fred from/with ptv played an excellent set before ptv , with stuff i have
not heard anywhere. i  asked fred afterwards what was it, and he said it was
a lot of detroit techno and some euro stuff. then ptv came on, doing their
pagan/rave invocation with neat beats and samples. there was even some
fog, which didn't work for me. they played a solid 1 1/2 hrs, maybe two.
then afterwards there was more cool music, in the rave/trance  vein.
all in all, an excellent rave.

Actually, to set the record straight, I wasn't the one that commented about
the acoustics. I think I did mention to you (privately) that Gavin
Convention "The Bomb" rap show was at the Longshoreman's Hall and that the
acoustics weren't too good.  (The show itself was mostly excellent because
the rappers were able to pull through on raw talent -- the problem was that
the PA system was underpowered and underspeakered for such a cavernous
hall.) The Sharon sound system was definitely much better as long as you
weren't on the perimiter of the hall.

At the Golden Gate Park "rave" on Sunday, I was talking to one of the
people associated w/ Sharon and he said that it got shut down due to
complaints from the nearby hotels.

I'm getting the impression that these raves are now becoming targets for
police action -- the Golden Gate Park "rave" got peacefully shut down by da
Pigs around 7:30PM as an "illegal gathering."

Can't let Michael Paint too rosy a picture here. Carefree (3:30AM-6:30AM)
was absolutely brutal -- the *MASSIVE* sound system pulverized the brain
into an nebula of twinkling axons... tenderized the body into a squamous
mass of quivering gristle.  For the most part, this wasn't your lightweight
pap techno material. It was both pretty hard and pretty lysergic -- in the
absence free will, you just *had* to dance ... it was kinda like when you
get this itch in your ear and you stick a piece of barbed wire in to
scratch it. But it kinda gets stuck, and you still haven't scratched that
itch, so you take a mallet and hammer it through till it comes out yer
other ear... dontcha just hate when that happens?

Once again, it was cool seeing and meeting even more sfraves members!

  Did anyone else check out the rave (or rave-type) event in Golden Gate Park
yesterday? I got there kinda late, but there were still about 70-100 folks there. The energy had died down some, but a few people were still dancing. An older
raver and his kid did some seven-ball juggling passing which got the crowd 
hyped up for a while.  The DJ, though well-intentioned, needed more time in
the woodshed practising his transitions.  In all, though, a nice scene.  Very
60s in many ways: the jazzier costumes, the minimal "wave your arms and move
in rhythm" dancing, the general ambience of acceptance...

Well  MTV finally did it.  I also watched it because my favorite VJ DUFF
was there.  They called it the "Weekend Rave".
They had a smart bar and even one of those
gyro looking rides.  The only techno group that I saw was Shamen and
KLF (sorta techno), but they played mostly rap songs. Everybody is going
to think that this is a rave. HA!  
IMHO, we should start thinking of a new name for the really rave. Maybe
something with an obscene name so they can't announce on the radio or TV.

Subject: Picnic from Hades, Pt. 1

Greetings, friends from the East (Bay).  It sounds like plans for a
May 2nd picnic in your vicinity are inexorably in motion.

I think that you three should be in charge of deciding on and securing
the location.  I have a passing familiarity with Tilden and Mills, and
think either of them would be excellent.  If you decide Miller is that
much better, that's fine, provided cars can get close enough to
the actual site to make hauling the sound system practical.

In terms of securing the location, I don't know if you want to do more
than just reserve a BBQ site, like check whether we'd need a permit
to set up the sound system.  That's probably what I would do, but I'll
trust your collective judgment -- I suppose the worst that could happen
is they make us shut off or turn down the PA's (or is it?).  Someone should
bring a blaster in tapes in case this happens (I have a number of decent rave
tapes).

Assuming I do a short stint at Wax the night before, I could probably
show up with the generator at around 1pm Saturday.  I'd probably want
to split by 6 or 7 and go home and get some rest before Equinox that
night, so either we should plan to break down the sound by then, or
else someone else from the city should volunteer to take the generator
home.

In terms of numbers, I think SFR people should be strongly encouraged
to bring a small number of close rave friends (up to 3?) so we maintain
our group identity without being too small or incestuous.  If this works,
we should get somewhere in the 50-70 people range, a fairly nice size
(i.e. each of us can meet almost everybody at some point).  No doubt
the second one in GG Park will be somewhat larger.

Does all this sound good?  Tell me what you think.

	The simple answer is: yes. I talked to my sysadmin, who's also a friend
(and a freshman! Can you imagine a freshman here at Berkeley making $15/an hour
as a sysadmin!!! :) and he said that barring any great national emergency, 
petrus will be alive and well all through summer. I'll be gone only for about
5 weeks in LA, and I'll have net access via a friend at Caltech, which is
only a few miles from my house. So, all should be well - the only drawback
is I won't actually be able to go to 5 week's worth of raves, so I'll be
depending on you all for calendar info and such to help keep it up to date.
I'll be back up later for summer school, so I'll still be able to rave here
most of the summertime......

	"A Rave Called Jack" at the UOP campus has been canceled for the 
following fucked-up (yes, I am pissed because the cancellation makes me look
like an idiot on the rave list) reasons:
	A)  The Stanford Public Safety Campus Police spoke with
our Public Safety and told them they would never allow another rave on
campus.  It wasn't worth the effort.  It was too loud, went too late, and 
people who sneaked past the checkpoint were doing drugs and left trash.
Ahhhhh--poor campus police had to work that night.
	B)  Two "Ravers" set a bunch of newspapers on fire in front of the
Suttertown News building in Sacramento claiming that raves shouldn't
be compared to hippie stuff and that they were all about free speech.
Nice oxymoron that, eh.  Well, the Suttertown is a pretty reputable rag 
and the reporter is a reputable guy, and these guys pissed him off
enough to get bad press in three other sac newspapers including
the Bee- the most widely circulated one.

Hey kids,

I had a fun weekend which included CareFree saturday night and GGPark on
Sunday.
CareFree was nice and un-crowded, but the music could have been better -
I've heard that it has been in the past.

A couple of news tidbits:

One of the CareFree organizers tells me that they're no longer associated
with ToonTown, and that he believes this is a good thing for the
continuation and improvement of CareFree.  I think he's right.

At GoldenGate I talked with 'love', who works with the Sharon crew.  He
told me they're looking into buying a big above-ground pool for use in a
future rave. Interesting...

Just curious -- how did the Stanford police end up finding out about the
UOP rave? Or how did UOP find out about the Stanford rave. I sure hope it
wasn't through some snitch on this list (who else would know about both the
Stanford rave and the UOP rave???). There are also students who earn extra
money as snitches for the cops. So beware before you share!

Fortunately, there are also students/administrators that can snitch on the
cops -- A while back, the Stanford Police came off as real idiots because
they tried doing a bust at the old Alpha Delt house (now the site of EBF,
where the Stanford Rave occurred). Fortunately, an "insider" found out
about the impending police action (and search warrant) warned the house
residents prior to the raid.

These selfsame Stanford cops also ended up cancelling the incredibly cool
Frost Ampitheater Dead shows because of "the undesirable element" that the
shows brought to campus. Alas, those wonderful and relatively small
outdoors shows were about as ravelike as you could get back in the
early-to-mid eighties. Obviously, such a scene might sidetrack the future
Milken Jr.'s @ Stanford from achieving greed-based world domination, so the
scene had to be stopped at all costs.

In general, I think the police are beginning to crack down on today's
"scene" what with the Sharon rave and the Golden Gate Park rave getting
shut down in the same weekend.

Who out there remembers Recess?  It was Thursday nights at 3rd & Harrison for a
few months in the summer of 90.  In my mind it was the first "rave-type" event
in the city, although I wasn't much into the scene back then.  I think
Come-Unity started around then, too, probably a few months later.  Doc Martin
and Quartknee were the promoters of Recess, back when Doc was new to SF.  There
were probably other people involved, but they were the ones I knew about.

Anyway, back to the story.  At the opening of Recess, they had a kiddie pool in
the middle of the dance floor with apples in it, presumably for bobbing.  The
evening started out with roller skates (they had rentals and some brought their
own) zipping around the pool while a few people danced.  As the night
progressed, it became more dance-oriented and less roller rink-oriented.  But
the mix was fun.  Then some drag queen in mermaid drag came out to swish in the
pool and someone drove in a motorcycle.  What a scene!  With roller skaters, a
mermaid with apples, a motorcycle, and hundreds of people dancing!  Definitely
a fun time.  Doc wanted it to be a "place for all the kids to have fun." 
Supposedly they had free E the first night, but I didn't see any of it...

Later Recesses had other gimmicks, like hoola hoop night.  Doc spun a mix of
hip-house, pop-house, and techno and other dancable stuff he brought with hmi
from New York.  They even had Dee-Lite perform before Dee-lite made it big. 
(Of course at the time, I was, like:  "Who's this Dee-lite thing?  I'm not
going to stand in some stoopid line for some stoopid live band!")  I could have
kicked myself when I realized who they were.

There were a couple outdoor events that summer and a "Watch it Jiggle" -- the
first party I went to that had a meeting point:  location to be announced.  it
ended up being at Big Heart City.

It was a fun summer and it looks like this summer is going to be even better!
I'll have to dig out my Hall Pass from Recess to wear to the next rave!  

Share and enjoy,

Tim

Hello all...

Well, just to comment on what Joel said about mainstream rave going to
alternative club....

This is true.  As some of you may know, KWOD 106.5 in Sac has their Shark
Club at the Yukitan and broadcasts on the radio.  Granted this is not to
be considered a rave, but techno-rave is already mainstream, and with
the help of these radio stations and all, "mainstream rave" is already
being known as "alternative" and "progressive".  Is this good?  Well, 
it all depends on your point of view.  Yes, it can be good in the sense that
it can "legitimize" (for lack of a better word) rave.  However, as we
can see it happening already, because of all the exposure, techno-rave
music is getting bad rap.

When people hear the term "rave", they automatically associate it with
"underground", "X", and other socially-negative terms.  What can we do
about it?  We can't just ignore it...

Subject: Busted!


Raves have always gotten busted.  I'm not alarmed that there is a crackdown. 
Over half of the full moon raves I've gone to or have heard about have been
busted, sometimes even before I get there.

It's not surprising -- usually there's something illegal (or at least against
regulations) going on.  At the GG picnic, I think it was that we didn't have a
permit for loud music.  At the full moon raves, it's usually something to do
with the location.  Like the one on Baker Beach (part of the Presidio military
base) that was shut down by the MPs fifteen minutes after it started.  The one
in Marin in December had some park rangers show up, but they just poked around
a bit.  They left after not finding anything illegal going on.

The cops actually showed up at the Vellejo full moon rave around 2:30.  I was
back at my car and they asked why all the cars were parked there.  I muttered
something about there being music somewhere up there.  He drove up the street a
bit, turned around, and left.  They didn't come back until 5:30, or so, after
those garbage trucks couldn't get through because the street was blocked.  They
were supposedly very polite and not antogonistic at all.  I bet that if we had
kept the road open, they wouldn't have bothered us.

Sharon was shut down because people staying inthe Sheraton nearby were
complaining about the noise.  Surely the promoters could have turned down the
volume, but what's a rave when you can't hear the music?

Raves that are planned and have the right permits rarely get busted.  It's just
a matter of cooperating with the regulations, regardless of how ridiculous they
are.

One thing you should be aware of though, is that I've heard that drug agents
are starting to attend the mainstream raves (e.g., Toon Town) dressed in rave
gear -- floppy hats and all.  So be careful in your transactions. 

Share and enjoy!  Be cool,

Tim

others envolved in trying to get this together.  "Jack" had alot of potential
to be good for this area and it got squashed.  Well, heads up, we'll still
be going to as many raves as possible but it really makes me wonder about
how much longer things will be going on  if the press really don't like us.
This have the potential of being highly rated for creativity and other things
that the press LIKE to write about.  What we've managed to do is show our
ignorance of what free speech is and what rights we have as individuals.
We should have responded in letter form to the editor, gee do we have
enough people who write everyday???  I think we have to realize that "we"
will pay as a group for actions we do not necessarily agree with.  This

  It was sad to hear about the defusing of the UOP rave. Tim Hyland's remarks,
though, are the medicine we need. Do it by the book, no matter how weird or justplai stupid the regulations seem, and The Powers will usually let you alone. 
The 60s scene was lucky to have Bill Graham and Chet helms, who filled out the
forms and dealt with the nonsense so that the musicians and dancers could sing
and dance.
  But let's not kid ourselves: any underground, alternative, or bohemian scene
in America will always attract (1) people who want to shut it down or bust it,
and (2) people who will try to co-opt it and make some quick bucks by turning
it into a marketable fad. There's not a whole lot you can do to keep either
group out.  But you can be smart (don't sell drugs to people you don't know well) and tolerant (well, hell, if Joe Lawyer and Jane Realestate wan to boogie downto techno at Toontown, let 'em dance!).

I hate to add yet another metaremark to everyone's mailbox (but then
how could I resist such an appealing subject: line) but _problems_
with following the letter of the law with permits &c. is that you come
to the attention of the authorities that way, by definition, & also
that it is almost impossible to satisfy them if they are determined to
shut you off.  They can always do something to keep you from using a
facility, especially at the last minute when it's most vulnerable.
Frost Dead or Greek Theater Dead are good examples.  The Dead
followers are always a mess when they come to town, but check out the
campus area after a big game at Memorial stadium.  But guess who's
still playing?

One thing for sure is bad press & publicity/notoriety will be
very harmful.

Subject: By The Book

	Arthur wrote that the best way to insure a rave not getting
shut down is to do it by the book.  I agree with this wholeheartedly.
However, getting a facility by the book can cause a rave to never 
get off the ground.  
	The reason Public Safety wigged out is because we were trying
to go by the book by consulting them on regualtions for crowd
control etc.  Same as Time and Body went by the book to have a checkpoint
type deal.  I think that, at least  with our situation, there was
no way around the paranoia that seems to be festering with some
people.  Oh well, We will try again to get this section of the valley's
wasteland brought to life (ie Stockton, Lodi, Tracy, Modesto, Hell, etc)

In pondering the fate of the deposed leader of ToonTown, I was wondering
what role was played by the disruption in the scale and layout of UFO's
Are Real (as compared to the advertised configuration), as well as the
sub-Gathering paid turnout?  Not to mention the over-extension of the
177 Townsend space?  Or were these just the tip of the iceberg?

Who actually had the power to fire him?  Are there investors / board of
directors?  Or was it subordinates?

Curious to get the scoop on all this...

Well Unfortunately I missed out on the what is RGO (Really Going On)
last weekend. Do to the fact that, MY RIDE FLAKED! No hard feelings
to the ride person who also happens to be my household mate.

But as you have all said the Gathering was happening..
I went to a party up here on Fri nite and I ran into some people
who said they were going to the Gathering. My roomate has never been
to a rave before. He asked a certain individual about it. And what
this individual said might give a clue as to the bad publicity that
occurs about raves.

He said , "Oh yeah, I've been to lots of raves. YEah they are cool. Once I
saw this guy and chick just out on the floor in front of the board fucking
each others brains out. Then at another I saw this guy sucking this other
guys dick, in front of everyone. Wow it was incredible!"

The above is a toned down version of what was actually said. 
BUT YOU GET THE POINT!
If people , even us people into raves, describe it as that, then
we deserve the publicity we get. I still have yet to clue my roomate
into the fact that raves are not a sex-scapade or some other thing
...........

Well, I decided, I'll take my roomate to a rave to show him what
he can discover there..
Hopefully we will be able to make the Full moon Rave.

On a brighter note!
IF any of you ravers at UCDAVIS are raving a particular time.
LETS GET TOGETHER, CARPOOL, WHATEVER!

Subject: More about the picnic.....


	Andrea is making reservations 2-morrow for Redwood Glen, a picnic
site in Joaquin Miller Park. I would have made them today, but - get this - 
they need someone over the age of 21 to reserve it (BWAHAHAHA). We needed
to make reservations in order to get a sound permit. We're going as
legal as we can :).

	Here are the directions to Redwood Glen - take the 13 Freeway, exit
at Joaquin Miller Road, and go east. Stay on the road until you hit
Skyline Blvd., and turn left. That road twists and bends a bit, and about
a mile up you should see an entrance on the left that says Sequoia Arena/
Redwood Glen/Horseshoe Picnic Area. Go in this entrance, and turn _left_.
This becomes a narrow one-lane paved road, so watch for traffic coming 
in the other direction. After about 200 yards, you'll come to a large
picnic area, with quite a bit of parking. That's where we'll be.
(You'll hear the music :) There are bathrooms about 50 yards away, and
a drinking fountain, and LOTS of BBQ pits and tables.
	If there's no parking left when you get there, there's a place
just before the entrance on Skyline, somewhat close to the picnic area.

	Music is well taken care of. I'll be bringing an amp and two
speakers (JBL 18" 300 watts - should be enough, no?), and djpj@leland.
stanford.edu offered to bring 2 turntables and a mixer. I can also
bring two CD players (one with pitch-control) and a tape deck. The two
of us will spin for awhile; james@apple.newton.com and pgrassi@scuacc.scu.edu
also offered to help spin. Anyone else who wants to have a hand at the
turntables, I think we can handle that (a truely interactive rave). Oh, and
mgold@efi.com also offered to rent the generator. If the four of you could
write me back privately and confirm, I'd appreciate it.

	The picnic will "start" at 12 noon (those who are setting up music/
food should arrive at 11 or so), and will last until 5, or whenever people
poop out. 

	Now for the most crucial part of any picnic: food. So far the only
offers I've had are from geoffw@isys.com for fruit and maybe some smart
drink mixtures, dhchung@us.oracle.com who also offered to get what we
needed, and ccat@netcom.com said he's be willing to offer some of his
smart-drink mixtures as well (all au gratis, of course). 
	This is what we need:

	BBQ meats - if anyone out there is a good chef/barbequer, and is willing
to act as chef for a little while, please volunteer. I think if someone were
to act as "patty-jockey" for a few hours, a few other people could come up with
hot dogs, hamburgers, or maybe since we're a lot healthier as a group than the average Americans, creative things to cook like a vegetarian shish-ka-bob or
shrimp or chicken or something (no tofu! Ugh.) I'm not sure how large it'll be,
but I'm hoping around 50 people show up (I really would like to see 80 or
so). So, plan around that. We obviously don't need prime steak or anything - 
a quick jaunt to Price Club would probably provide enough. 
	BBQ supplements - like buns, ketchup/mustard/relish/lettuce, etc.
	Drinks - we don't have an alcohol licence (and chances are they
_will_ check in every once in a while, seeing as how we'll be at their
biggest picnic site), so if you can't go a few hours without it _don't_come_.
CCat's smart drinks need some fruit juices to be mixed with. Also, a few
flats of soda, like Dad's root beer or Coke or something should hit the
spot. (I wish I knew the eating habits of everyone on the list, so I'm just
going by what I'd like to eat.) Even though they'll have a drinking fountain
there, I think bottled water might be warranted.
	Extras - like potato salad, chips, pickles, beans, anything that
could go along with the main cooked dish. This'll probably be the easiest
thing to take care of - if you decide to attend at the last minute, you could
grab something at the supermarket, like a couple big bags of chips or
something.
	Actually, I'd really like to see people get creative with all these
categories - keep in the spirit of alternative rave subculture...
	Also, dessert....
	Remember, I'm planning on 50-70 people. Just mail me with what
you can offer - don't worry about making knudsel for all 70, just more
than a few. 
	Everyone should have _something_ with them when they come. We can't
charge admission, so it'll be an honor system. 
	Condiments! How could I forget. We need: plates, spoons, forks, knives,
and cups. I've got a ton of napkins (long story), but we could use a few
more, I guess.

	Also, the site cost a bit to reserver and get the permit for - so I'm
going to ask for a few dollars to help defray costs (if 65 people show
up, each bearing $2, I'll break even). 

	OKay, that's it for now. Please mail all offers to me directly - 
I'll post again later this weekend to report how planning's going. Again,
I urge all your sfravers, not just the vocal ones, to come out, and bring
a few friends or family. At the very least, it's a gorgeous location,
lots of hiking and biking paths around, and a chance to breath clean
air....

	Now we just pray it doesn't rain.

	Toodles,

		Brian

Subject: Clarification on the time/location of the picnic


	     I forgot to mention the date of the picnic - May 2nd, a Saturday.

	     I also neglected to mention the easiest ways to get to the 13. 

     If you're coming from the SF peninsula - cross the Bay Bridge, and
go to the 580 east (Hayward) to the 24 east (Walnut Creek) to the 13 South.
Actually, to get to the 13 south you may need to exit at Tunnel Road; if
so, there are signs there that'll tell you the way to go.
     If you're coming from the south (San Jose, Santa Cruz, etc.), take
the 880 North towards Oakland. Around Fremont there's a freeway, either
the 237 or 238 I'm not sure, that you take east for a few miles to the
580 north (there should be a sign on the 880 freeway that says "237 west
to 580 north --->, etc.). Take the 580 north to the 13 north, and exit
Joaquin Miller Rd., and then follow the directions from the last post.
     If you're coming from the Sacramento/Vallejo/north bay area, take the
80 South, which becomes the 880 south, to the 580 east, and then follow the
same directions I gave for coming from SF.
      Finally, if you're coming from Walnut Creek area, take the 24 west
through the tunnels, to the 13 south. Again, you may need to exit on Tunnel
Road; if so, there'll be signs showing you the way.
      I forgot to see which busses go close to the site; I know a line goes
along Joaquin Miller, but I'm not sure if any go up Skyline. I can check if
anyone needs info. Let me know....

      Also, petrus occasionally kicks out an old sfraves article or two - 
it sent three out yesterday, so I'm sorry to anyone who looked out of
touch because of it. ("Is the Full Moon 2-night", etc.)

       Cya at the picnic!

First of all, head east, not west.

Good point.  I've made that mistake at that interchange and ended up on 24
when I wanted to be on 13.  The engineers who designed that interchange
should be strung up and shot.

Regardless, if you're coming from 80/580, Ashby Ave is the way to get to 13.

These may be much easier than previous ones to get to highway 13...

>From San Francisco take the Bay Bridge to Highway 580 EAST.  Take Highway
580 east all the way to the exit to highway 13.  This exit is one exit past
Mills College/Seminary avenue.  You will get off the freeway... stay to the
left and go under the freeway.  Yield into traffic onto an access road.
At the first stopsign make a left.  This is highway 13 (there are signs.)
Take Highway 13 north two exits to Joaquim Miller Road.

>From the Peninsula take either the Dumbarton Bridge or the San Mateo
bridge to Highway 880 north.  Take 237 (or, yeah, is it 238?) toward
Hayward (it goes east... it's the only direction you can take it).
Go up this road about a mile and a half, and take 580 WEST to Oakland.
DO NOT take 580 east... you will end up in the Central Valley.
Take 580 West to the highway 13 exit... take 13 to Joaquim Miller Road.

In both sets of directions... you will make the exit of Joaquim Miller road
and then yield right.  Get in the left lane.  Go up about a mile to Skyline
Boulevard and make a left (this road has a traffic island in the middle
right at the park entrance, plus a yellow metal gate).  Go up the mountain
several switchbacks... the rest of Brian's directions are fine.

I made the reservation for today... so everything is now set for May 2,
from noon-7pm (which would be when dark is just falling).  I mean, I 
made the reservation today.

Sorry, Brian, but now I wish I had done everything... the woman in the office
got this worried look in her eye and said "yeah, a young guy was here yesterday
but he wasn't 21... just what are you all doing?"  So I told her it was
a computer users' conference (wink) but now I'm worried that they will
be checking in on us.

So, please, don't be a dweeb and PLEASE keep your controlled substances
and alcohol at home.

Also, Susan said that if our music disturbed others we could be told to
either turn it off or leave.  So... this place is isolated on purpose but
we should probably keep it at a reasonable level.

Okay, I'm done with the anal retentiveness.... jeez, signing liability
contracts just give me the willies.

This may be part of a pattern, but don't get too discouraged.  These
clusters of harassment tend to come in waves.  There was one right
after New Years (with that huge ToonTown), that faded out after a
couple of weeks.  Hmmm, come to think of it, maybe it's those huge
ToonTowns that are the precursor of these attempted crack-downs...

Funnily enough, Sharon was the first victim last time around too.

I think that's a really good point:  in any case, we should keep the
level down to where we can hear ourselves talking to each other,
especially in the picnic table area.

This is starting to sound really good.  Oh, does anyone have any tips
on where to rent a generator in or near SF?  How many watts capacity

These crack-downs are as much a part of raves as techno, X, and floppy
hats when you remember that early English raves were busted up often,
especialy towards the end of the "early rave era" (sounds like David
Atenburough or something).  How many of us have met or know or have
heard about transplanted Europeans who came over hear to start or
participate in raves because of oppresion over there?  Maybe we should
examine history for a solution.  It realy suck when you start to try to
think about ways to not have to deal with "the athorities" and you come
to the conclusion that the only way to do that is to not be around
"the athourites" and the only way to not be around "the athourites" is
to...is to..   Ya, that's the part I hate.  We need more and better
secluded rave locations as well as getting permits, etc. for them.
It's too bad that the public rave image is partly shot and partly not

----begin included stupid mass-media lies----
Through the Looking Glass
A British dance craze has California Raving

It's a scene that could send a kid into years of intensive
psychoanalysis.  There is a cavernous room filled with throbbing
music, hazy psychedelic lights and whirling, bobbing, formless
figures, thousands of them, all color and angles.  Only the figures
aren't human, exactly; they're more like... nursery-rhyme characters.
There's the Mad Hatter, flailing around frantically and gorging on
lollipops.  Wait, isn't that Dr Seuss sucking on a balloon and
churning his pelvis?  Toy dolls grin, wink, stare.  Surreal images
snake across the ceiling: nightmare symbolism of the worst kind.
What's that, Mother Goose?  You want me to /dance/?

For Californians, this Freudian dream has become very real.  In San
Francisco and Los Angeles, a British dance-party trend has infiltrated
the underground club circuit.  They call them raves: leviathan
dance-fests that combine a squishy Grateful Dead philosophy with an
Alice in Wonderland ambience.  In huge warehouses and dance clubs,
thousands of paisleyed post-adolescents dance wildly until dawn to the
ceaseless beat of techno-house music - a numbing hybrid of hip-hop and
disco that compels some listeners to don elephantine hats, gulp
fluorescent juices and ingest mind-altering drugs.  It's dance-mania
with an aggressively cheerful maxim: Be Happy, Or Else.  ``It's more
than just a party,'' an LA raver named Rio says solemnly.  ``It's
something spiritual.''

Raves began here with a timeless conceit: well, they did it in Europe.
Though the trend is now all but dead there, in 1990 England was
overrun by the rave wave.  Fifteen thousand partyers was not uncommon
on a given night: dancing in open fields as a monolithic beast,
eschewing booze for Evian and lots of colorful pills.  Unfortunately,
the besotted revelry got so out of hand that the British Parliament
actually introduced an anti-rave  bill.  Undaunted, British ravers
hightailed it for Hollywood and started anew: circulating fliers in
trendy stores that told people here to find the next ultrasecret rave
site.

There are raves and then, in San Francisco, there is A Rave Called
Sharon.  Eleven ravers pile into a Chevy Capri, captained by a nearly
bald woman named Tornado, and careen their way to a warehouse in
nearby Santa Clara.  Inside, they experience many things, including
existential laser messages (``Sharon Finds Destiny'') and a humming
``mind-improvement'' contraption called Dr X-Static's Electro Brain
Pulverizer.  As the dancing reaches a frenzy, several ravers sport
``virtual reality'' helmets and genuflect before computer-generated
art - a powerful reminder that many of these ravers are Silicon Valley
tech-heads who've just discovered that the souldaddy look is way
cooler than Birkenstocks.  Rave organizer and namesake Sharon Virtue,
who is fond of words like ``togetherness,'' says the night's undying
cheerfulness reflects a very ``positive spirit.''

FUNK HEAVY: Ultimately, the insistent music is to blame for this
aberrant behavior; it /requires/ ravers to shed their inhibitions -
and, on occasion, pieces of their clothing.  The bands - Happy
Mondays, 808 State, The Shamen - tend toward synthetic funk heavy on
bass lines, light on angry social windbaggery.  LA raver Gary Varela
says ``the music is just'' - here comes that ravecentric word again
``happy.'' Happy, happy, happy - everything's happy.  So happy that,
deep in the bowels of A Rave Called Sharon, a dancing artist paints in
fluorescent colors, specifically pink when the music's /really/ happy.
All of which explains why, by Tornado's thinking, this trend hasn't
hit New York.  ``New Yorkers have a bad attitude,'' she explains.
``You can't be happy in New York.'' And, therefore, you can't rave.

There is, sadly, one big problem with this whole Lewis Carroll thing:
nobody's serving tea.  The rave drug of choice is Ecstasy, a
euphoria-inducing ``designer drug'' that makes dancing seem like a
holy mission.  Outside a recent LA rave, drug dealers were everywhere,
briskly selling the amphetaminelike pills - not to mention LSD - for
$20 a pop.  Other ravers sucked ``whippits,'' small balloons filled
with laughing gas.  ``The rush is like being on a roller coaster, like
you can't breathe,'' marvels Aletha Houser, 21, who pops Ex before she
raves.

Believe it or not, rave mavens insist the bashes can actually be
healthy.  Clubs have begun cracking down on drugs and, to be sure,
many ravers don't gobble hug-drugs to have fun.  Mike Voegele of Los
Angeles says he gets a ``natural high from the psychedelic imagery.''
Ironically, alcohol is shunned at most raves; instead dancers guzzle
herbal ``smart drinks'' with names like Psuper Psonic Psybertonic.
(They're only Pseudo-smart, but that's another story.)  All of which
leads to fewer fights, fewer boozy sexual advances and that ubiquitous
smiley-face atmosphere, ravers claim.  In fact, this delirium can get
so profound that it's almost as if, like some fuzzy 90's fantasy, it
doesn't really exist at all.

condescending tone about it all.... it seemed to imply that it's a fad, it'll
pass and die down as it did in England. If the powers at be are willing to
view it as a passing fad, we're in less danger than if they see it as a
threat, but nonetheless this is a kind of publicity we _don't_ need. One positive
thing: they mentioned that alcohol was not prevalant at raves, which is true 
and in my view a good thing. I think this article is about as positive as
any editor would allow it to be, too. I wish the writers would actually _go_

	Maybe if the media was more concerned with the truth than with
a sensationalistic witch hunt these people wouldn't write any articles :) !
What a bombardment of media hype over raves in the past week!  First
Geraldo, then the LA news, then this.  What next, will all the kids on
the family sitcoms start wearing floppy hats home?  That would be great!  I can
hear it now ("Honest dad, all the kids are doing X at school!")!!!!  Maybe
Doogie Howser's roomie will give up school and start a meth lab...
	Hey, here's a real potential outlet for creativity...Maybe all us
sfraver's should get together and write a story, a "true confessions of a
'raving lunatic'" tale and send it to Geraldo as a joke...Maybe start it with
a line like "Raves turned me on, and now I live for drugs."  
	Naw, they'd probably take it seriously.
	Anyway, even though it's starting to look like the media is preparing
to declare total war on the Rave culture, whatever they think it is, I'm not
all that alarmed (or surprised...).  All I can see happening is the mainstream clubs not associating themselves with anything rave-like in the future, and 
maybe some lame police attempts to bust underground raves.  So what else is
new.  When I start to get worried here, I think of all the B.S. that Genesis 
and Paula P-Orridge have had to put up with in the U.K.

	On a different note, I'm sad to say I can't make it to the picnic
(I'm stuck in Oregon) but my roommate, who has already moved to SF, should
be there and I'm sure he'll take great pains to make me as sorry as possible
that I missed it.  Have Fun!

I went to a Tower Records in San Mateo earlier this week looking for

around the neck including a happy face medalion, funky pants and
shirt.  Thinking that he was probably a raver and into house music I
asked him if he was into house music.  At first, he looked at me like
he didn't know what I was talking about and then he said, "no I don't
know that much about it and I'm not really into it".  So here was a
guy in raving uniform but didn't like house music.  That's when I
suspected he was probably just wearing the rave outfit as a fashion
statement.  I can just see it now:  one year from now everybody
(including people who have never been to a rave and those who don't
like em) is wearing funky raving outfits as a fashion without knowing
that ravers wear the same kinds of outfits.

Subject: degenerating raves



I'm very sad about what in my opinion, is the degeneration of Toon Town.  

TOON TOWN BEFORE IT WENT MAINSTREAM:  It used to be a roving rave where people 
came to have a good time, enjoy the music and dance and have FUN.  Meeting 
each other certainly did happen but it wasn't a major goal of the place.
People were mellow, open minded and accepting of others and having a
good time. 

Warning:  I use the SF slang, "Bridge and Tunnel types" in which I refer to 
the types of people described below.  I use the term for California rednecks
who think they have to act tough and macho and who have a certain state of 
mind rather than as a description for all people who have to travel over the
bridges or through a tunnel.  People who seem to carry their
toughness/coolness attitude with them to the raves.  I'm not saying
that everyone like that has to travel over a bridge or tunnel, nor am
I saying that everyone like that definitely comes over the bridge and
tunnel.  I know many super people who have to travel over the bridge
or tunnel.  I'm just using B&T as a convinient (but not too accurate)
term for the people with the attitudes of toughness I describe above.

TOON TOWN (& 8.0 AND SHARON) TODAY :  It's a "rave?" overrun by Bridge
& Tunnel types.  The B&T males 
are mainly interested in projecting a macho attitude to fellow males at the 
place as well as hitting on every woman in sight.  Dancing and FUN don't seem
to be a major priority of theirs.  They are not outgoing and they
carry an attitude of toughness that seems to be saying, "who the hell
are you?"  The not as prevalent Bridge & Tunnel 
females walk around in tight pairs or threes with their frizzy hair, squealing
and giggling as they observe and stare at some good looking guy.  The 
organizers are mainly concerned with making lots o $$$ rather than fostering a
hip environment.  There are long lines in front, trouble with the fire 
marshall, and a door diva who is on a pure power trip (with 8.0).  
The only thing that Toon Town today has in common with Toon Town 
before it went mainstream is a few DJs and the music.  The last Toon
Town/8.0 I went to was "UFO's are Real" and I felt like the positive 
atmosphere was no longer there.  In fact, I sensed it 4 months ago
already. I wouldn't go now even if I could get in for free.

I'm just wondering if this is what happens to raves when they go mainstream?

i just said all this on the phone to another sfraver, but it's clear
that the guy who pulled it all together just had no clue. whatever the
reporters at the actual raves in SF and LA sent in got filtered
through this bozo's perceptions.

Me and some friends have been talking about putting on
our own raves.  We've been worried that the "scene" is getting too
big and will eventualy be co -opted.  One of us came up with the idea
of having cooperative raves sorta like the way the picnic is happening.
Has anybody out there put on a rave can you tell us your experiences?
Did you have investors? Did you loose money?

I think if the scene is to survive we must be prepared to take
it underground if necessary.

Gawd. And the next thing that'll happen, guys will start piercing their ears

and having never even been in a gay bar, or who might even not particularly
be gay.

Leather pants, motorcycle jackets, ethnic clothing, cowboy boots... how DARE
these people wear the fashions without living the lifestyle!

Actually, I don't mind that all trends are temporal fashions to be picked up
and dropped in three years while inventing <THE NEXT BIG THING>.  What I
mind are people who don't get it when its time has come and past.

I think it'd be really a great joke to start a fashion and set when it would 
expire, preferrably right when it starts getting commercial. Like say,
on "April 1, 1994, this underground movement will be officially passe, Anyone
not onto the Next Big Thing by then will be officially a wannabe, to be 
snubbed at parties and otherwise scorned." (If only they had done this with
the greek system at colleges) There could be a big "Rave is dead" party,
coffee table books, retro-spective videos,  etc.

As with anything, there will be poseurs, and there will be true ravers.  Those
who turn in there floppy hats and Cartoon T's when it's no longer 'cool' to
rave will be the poseurs, just as thoes who grew out the shaved parts,
and put away thier hides were all just wannabes anyway. =:&

If you have any balls at all you will ignore fashiston and get your own

self.  If some one doesn`t like the way you look, fuck them, that's not
your problem.  If they try to make it your problem get in thier face
and tell them what you think about it.  Tell them, "hey ASSHOLE, I'm not

 I called the (408)-236-2022 number for directions ( the other number now

High School. This is located at the intersection of Herriman Ave. and
Saratoga-Sunnyvale Rd. The phone directions say to use Saratoga-Sunnyvale
road exit from HW280, driving south away from the bay. 

 The phone directions emphasize meeting AT THE PARKING LOT OF SARATOGA
HIGH SCHOOL. Vans will be provided for transport to the site, and PEOPLE
SHOWING UP AT THE SITE WILL BE TURNED AWAY, BACK TO THE SHS PARKING LOT.
I thought this was a enough of a change to warn people about.

 Ironically, I won't be able to make it until quite late - I don't know if
the vans will be bussing people to the site after 11PM. Does anybody
know?

I think it's important to realize that we all dress in styles.  THe important
thing is to not judge others by them or to not make complete judgements by
style of dress.  When I'm rock climbing or sunning at the beach I wear shorts, 
t-shirts, and teva sandles.  When I'm at work I wear my hair in a pony tail
and dress nice(r).  When I'm raving or just kick'n it I wear bagy levis and
a solid color (usualy black or white) long or short sleeve shirt.  I have 
been known to wear a suit now and then.  I'm not just some berkeley environ-
mentalist outdoors type, or a raver, or whatever.  I'm all that and a lot
more and it sure pisses me off when I can tell by looking at someone or
by the way they treat me that they have this pre-conceived notion about
who or what I am.  I mean we all make and take first impressions but I feel
respected when I can tell someone is looking past my pressent appearence for
who I am.  Good bad-exapmles:  I'm walking down the street.  "got any buds
dude".  - Just because I have long hair and look "counter culture".  Standing
in line for Raw Fusion (a rap band) with my friend Jonas, who hangs with 
Dave (DJ Fuze, the white DJ of Raw Fusion and Digital Underground - and no
I'm not name dropping) and being told "I don't think this is your kinda show".
Being at the full moon rave and having the bridgest, tunnelist, looking short-
haired concord looking mother fucker I ever did see (see, I can do it too)
give me this look and smirkey comment that had something to do with the fact
that he thought he had more of a right to be there then I did.  Oh, I also
get "you work at a computer company?!".  Being reasonably self-confident, 
these episodes don't realy make me feel bad but it certainly lessens your
opinions and judgements about your particular judgers.  I guess that's
the natural check and balance system for keeping separate people who are
cool to the core and people who try so hard to be cool but realy aren't.

my cohorts and i just put on a cooperative rave last night.
it is relatively easy to do, once you get past the difficulty of 
finding a place.  sound systems can be rented anywhere, and there are
plenty of dj's who will work for free.  

what has been effective for us is to hype the hell out of it to our
friends, and also tell anyone who wants to bring some gear or art or
whatever to do so.  so when it comes to show time, people just show
up and start setting their gear up. people who work with you on this
stuff will eventually ask a friend of theirs with some cool computer
graphics or quick-time stuff to show up too.  bingo...
and they told two friends

well, ever since i got back from the woopy ball, i've been hassling my
housemate to come to a rave with me.  the Deep Rooted House thing
sounded like a good deal - he's into the great outdoors, and the whole
event looked very promising.

so, we spend hours organizing ourselves, arranging meetings with other
sfravers, figuring out who's driving who's car, etc...  we get there
around 1 am (i think), park on the side of the road and walk up.  we
see cop cars.  bad sign.  deciding to make the best of it, we ask the
first officer we see if we're in danger of being towed.  true to his
profession, he never gives us a straight answer, only saying that
"yes, there are some illegal parking spots on the side of the road."
finally he asks us if we're going to "the party."  we say "yeah."  he
says, "well, there isn't going to be any party.  just get in your car
and turn around and leave."  so, being good little law-abiding ravers,
we do.  the cops orange-coned off the entrance to saratoga springs.

damn!  looked like a SPIFFY spot for a rave.

the next day, mike and i went back to the spot to see what it looked
like in daylight.  really cool.  the sound system was there, ernie
munson was spinning, and about 20 or so hardcore dancers were bopping
on the pavement.  maybe 40 people were hanging around, watching.  mike
recognized a fellow who told us that the rave regrouped around 7.30 or
8 am after the break-up.

well, we lost out big time, but we had the consolation of heading back
to a fellow raver's domicile and recording a seriously great techno
track that is destined to become a rave classic within a month.  no
joke.

	Those in my posse got there early, around 8, 'cos we had a bunch of
camping gear with us. We went to the parking lot of Saratoga HS, and there
weren't a whole lot of people then. We waited for the VW bus to arrive, and we
were on our way up a few minutes later.

	Sam (swick@madvax.uop.edu) had camped here b-4, so he knew a good spot
near the river. We set up our tent, threw the stuff inside, and went to go
check out the action.

	There were quite a few different things going on - at first it looked
like it could be as diverse as the Woopy Ball. There was a dub/reggae dance
floor, a food-selling and vendor area, and tucked away down the valley was the
main techno floor. The techno floor had an intellibeam (these things are cool
outside, too!), lasers projected onto a mirror ball, and a bunch of cool
projections against the hillside. The music was great, Spun was spinning most
of the time. There were also four HUGE stacks of speakers, more hardware than
I've seen at most raves, but it wasn't loud at all. I was standing over the
mixing table at one point, and I saw a man come up and ask that the music be turned 
down just a little.. he looked like he might be the owner of the campground
or something. 

	The crowd was disappointing - Sam and I figured only about a third
of the people there were "true ravers" (I know, a _very_ bad distinction to
make, and _not_ one based on fashion or dress, but on how many we saw with
a Bud Dry in their hands and wearing Kappa Sigma Phi baseball caps :). There
were a lot of people dancing, but the energy and "happiness" wasn't there.
I accidentally brushed against this one guys while I was trancing out, and he
nearly knocked me out. Oy. 

	We gathered some firewood and went back to the campsite, which was
somewhat distant from where the dance floors were. We hung around there for a
while, talking with dozens of other ravers/campers. THAT was where the spirit
was. I went back to the floor around 12, but the vibe still wasn't there, so
I reasoned that I'd go back to the tent and relax for a few hours, and then
re-rave around 3, when hopefully the real phreaks would activate. ON my way
back I spotted a lot of cops, so I started taking pictures of everything.
By that time every location had been swamped with people, and the cops were
checking out all the dark corners, questioning people. On the way back I noticed
perhaps a dozen different campsites with fires around them, and maybe 20 or
so other people huddled around, some listening to dance music, etc. Then around
1:30 we heard this incredible mass groaning/screaming, similar to what I heard
when I was at the opening of "Boyz in da Hood" at Universal Amphitheatre, 
for those who remember what happened. The cops had shut down the music and
asked everyone to leave, citing some Santa Clara county ordinance prohibiting
dancing between 2 and 9 a.m. There were now well over two dozen brownshirts,
and they had a video camera going as well. They told everyone who didn't have a
camping site that they'd have to leave. I had also heard that they shut down the
parking lot at SHS because it was completely full, and at one point there were 
250 people waiting to use three VW vans to go the 2-mile distance. So for about
an hour there was mass confusion, but things settled down after that. The
dance music at the campsites went on, with even more people this time, and that
was where the true spirit of the event lay. 

     The four of us crashed around 5 or 6, and awoke around 9. The dance floor
was going again by that time, and they were filling up a pool with river water
for later use (the water was green, so we voted against swimming.) The free
spirit was evident and Spun was spinning YET AGAIN (this guy really earns his
pay), playing lotsa nice house music. We left around 1:15PM, when this really
bad DJ got on (it wasn't Munson), and started playing a really bad selection
of music, and lazy lazy mixing. There were no cops there in the morning, and
the music was even louder than the night before.

     I had fun. Sorry the cops told the rest of you to leave. So, are going
sorry, are you going to convert this killer techno song you recorded last
night to a .snd file and post it, Jon? Hm?

     Anyone go to Higher than Heaven? Or Shiva's down in LA, for that matter?

This rave list is beginning to sound like a police report.

I went to the "04.24.92" or the "Map Point" rave on Friday;
actually it might have been a Utopia event, cuz I picked 
up a flyer yesterday for a Utopia Feel-X rave that was 
supposed to have been on Friday, and the list of DJ's
overlapped this rave's DJ list, and they may have been
 identical.

Anyway, it was at the Russian Center in SF, (Western 
Addition, Sutter & Divisadero), which is a fairly
nice place.  When I walked up one of the neighbors
was at the door complaining about the noise and 
threatening to call the cops, but I went in anyway.

They had one big room which i guess they use as a 
theater normally; it had a big open floor (with a
platform in the middle with a rock 'em sock 'em
robots set up) and a stage and a balcony, and
the standard laser, disco ball, fog machine and 
slide show.  There were a couple of extra rooms
to either side as you entered; one had a regular
bar and smart bar; the other was more of a 
chill-out room where people could paint neon
on these paper plates under the UV light.  

I don't know which DJ was on when, but the music
was sort of lame before about 2 am (the DJ was
switching songs too often, not really getting
into a groove, and they seemed to have the volume
turned down a little and the sound wasn't very
good).  Not too many people dancing.  After 2 the 
music was better and louder and a bit more 
aggressive - more people started dancing. 
Still, I'd guess that fewer than 100 people
were dancing and not a lot of people were
that into it.

Anyway, the cops shut it down at about 3:45;
there was an after-party at 3rd and 
Harrison, but I didn't check it out.

I went to H t H with Mykl G this Saturday nite.  Between two live acts
( Midi Rain and Frank Genius) and a lack of local competition, the
Hardkiss crew had a winner on their hands.  Unlike "Small" a few weeks
ago, this was way crowded, with a big line stretching down Jessie St.
We were told that Frank Genius had already performed.  339 Jesse, btw,
is a back entrance to Big Heart City; the rave was held downstairs.
The dance area was next to the smart bar / chill area, has some nice
moire projections and black light paintings.  By 2 am or so, the rave
got to take over Big Heart City completely.  This club has always
impressed me as being a fun & comfortable space that played "rave
greatest hits", has an adequate laser, and whose only drawback was the
shopping mall set that tends to show up.  No such problem this time;
the upstairs had good music and people were more or less with the
program.  Although there were probably more "outies" than "innies" in
attendance, there was none of the overly-male vibe many folks have
felt at, say, 8.0.  Downstairs was a regular techno inferno, I'm not
sure who the dj was, but he did a good job of mixing some hard edge
minimal stuff without getting boring, which is always a risk imho.
The ambient heat was a plus, I think; it's easier to 'get out of your
body' when it's wet with sweat. People were filtering upstairs,
though, as Midi Rain was expected.  They (he - it was one guy, with
Frank Genius as a last minute addition)came on about 2:45, and played
very good live techno; interesting samples and textures over drum
machines.  It was pretty minimal when viewed as performance however.
Just 2 guys with keyboards and a stack of blinking boxes.  None of the
eye contact and audience interaction one thinks of as being a part of
a 'concert' experience.  Of course people *did* enjoy it and expressed
themselves by dancing.  "Live techno"; maybe the name sez it all -
whatta hybrid.  Anyway I left about 3am as my choline / gingko drinks

I plan on bringing a largish rice & curried vegetable salad.  It feeds
anyone, including vegetarians, and requires no refrigeration.  Also
some drinks and disposable forks & plates; enough extras to help a few folks
out, not enough for all 50.   Are there bike *racks* at the site?
