Subject: [sfraves] A (rare) weekend report


Usually my weekends are full of kid centric events that most of you wouldn't be too interested in, but this weekend we also snuck in a few parties so here's a report...

Saturday started out with a school event the Spring Fling at my son Bennett's elementary school.   That turned to be pretty cool actually as these three kids closed the event with metal and punk covers (Ozzy, Sex Pistols, ..)  they were pretty cute and just in 5th grade.  The principal of the school is a "surfer chick" and there are some pretty cool parents actually.

After we left the Fling, we headed over to the GGP where the Brasstax crew had a BBQ and bouncy house going.  Saw some friends, Megan who I met at Prohibition Underground (yeah!) and met her new boyfriend, saw Doug from Homeland and his friends, and made a couple of new friends too.  THis was a kid friendly park BBQ event with some nice breaks and good sound.  The usual rascals in attendance, dogs, kids, herb.  My son T (age 2) was puting downs some dance moves and at one point used the frisbees to create a dance platform to demosntrate.  

A good Saturday in the park SF style.   You know how we do it.

Saturday AM I had heard about this party that was going down Saturday night that was on the DL, a previously cancelled party by the Strategik crew that was still going to go down at a new "super secret" location not be revealed under pain of death.  We didn't have a sitter but it sounded intriguing and after the afternoon in the park I had the urge for a renegade and especially hearing some more music outside.  Managed to wrangle a last minute sitter, this never happens, and everything fell into place for the evening.  

I love it when a plan comes together!  Considered trying to hit both AlphaBeats and the renegade, but decided that the necessary gear, attire, and other logistics weren't going to work out for that.  We decided to just do the covert style renegade.

So around midnight we head off to the map point.  Hop on the shuttle to the party which was full and we were on our way.  A very nice young lady and a fairly short drive led us to the drop off point and we were were there!  We did our best to covertly exit the vehicle and head off with our waiting guide who led us towards the party.  Well almost, as we now had to climb a steep hill on these rather difficult log steps which were lit with glowsticks.  Umm fuck me!  

Hoping that I'd still be able to walk much less dance when I got to the top, we climbed along with the others that rode in with us.  I was glad that one younger guy who rode with us was sucking worse than me on those steps although as he told me he had just finished eating a "huge fucking burrito", drank a fair quantity of beer and also some Jamiseon's.  Did he remember that this party had no outhouses or bathrooms?  All rightee then...

About this location...I'm going to try and write this report so as to not give it away for future generations, but just two words to start: fucking awesome

Strategik crew, whoever did your scouting for this one deserves an award bc this spot was great.  When I said the party was an outdoor that's only part of the picture as the party really consisted of two outdoor "rooms" and a chill area and the front room was partially in a structure, which was also the entrance to the space.  Chill room had no music which was nice since when you are outside sometimes it is just nice to experince being outside.

As you came to the top of the steps, there was a large opening draped with curtains which lent a nice air of mystery to the entry into the party.  Another nice touch IMO.

Also, my god people did youy have to carry all that gear up those log steps?  This party involved some significant effort form the crew.  Wow!  Thank you!  

Front room as I said was paritally in a structure which lent a nice industrial edge to the outdoor spot.  The second room was under a canopy of trees connected to the first area by a pathway through a group of trees that formed a kind of tunnel that you walked through.  All of this was nicely lit with glow stuff or little lights.  Very nice.

Music was of course breaks and more breaks which I expected.  Still when you have two rooms its nice to have more variety between the rooms.  Just a hopefully constructive comment!  Heard some good tracks in both rooms, but liked the music up front a little better most of the night.  Yummy.  w00t!

Saw sfravers Adriana and the illustrious laser powered Ray Wong at the party.  I heard Dina was there too, but I never her saw her... Dina, if you were there and I missed you sorry!  Or anyone else I forgot to mention.  As always we met some new friends as well.  The Dude Crawling on the Ground for the Lost Bud and this shirtless guy I thought was Dances with Cans but wasn't.  I hereby dub you "Should Dance with Dances with Cans".

We stayed until sunise and amusingly were leaving at the same time as the kids that had rode in with us including "huge fucking burrito".  They looked appropriately trashed and worse for wear.  Hmm, I might have too.  But when we got to the bottom the shuttle didn't have room for all of us, they stayed behind, and the symmetry of the evening was broken.  A fitting ending somehow.

Summary: Good party, amazing location, great production/logistics/security. Did not get busted!   Impressive!  

The only negative I can mention was that the super secret nature of the event limited the attendance a bit too much.  Another hundred people and the place would have been rocking.  

Let's do it again.

Peter

[ K O N T R O L ]

4 YEAR ANNIVERSARY



featuring from Jena, Germany
in their West Coast debut:


WIGHNOMY BROTHERS

(Freude am Tanzen . Musik Krause)

Robag Wruhme and Monkey Maffia, known collectively as
The Wighnomy Brothers, are best friends, label owners,
production partners, and one of planet Earth's most
entertaining and sought-after DJ teams. Known for their
remix-heavy, vodka-soaked extended sets, the delightful
duo from Jena, Germany have travelled the globe far and
wide rocking parties and festivals, but thanks to their
distaste for a certain ex-President of ours, they have
refused to play the US. Until now.  We simply adore
these guys and without question, they have held a slot
near the top of our "most wanted" list since we first
sought out on this colorful voyage. Thus, it is with great
pride and pleasure that we celebrate four years of bringing
forward-thinking techno and house to San Francisco with
a four hour set by the inimitable, incomparable, and
absolutely unmissable Wighnomy Brothers in their
exclusive West Coast debut.



with [KONTROL] residents:

ALLAND BYALLO  (Nightlight . Auralism . Leibe*Detail)

NIKOLA BAYTALA  (S.W.A.T. . Robsoul . Junior Boys Own)

CRAIG KUNA  (Platform . ESDJCO)

SAMMY D (Classic. Dirtybird . Magnificent 7)

WIGHNOMY BROTHERS

Music is the light of their lives!  Wighnomy Brothers are Robag Wruhme and
Monkey Maffia.

Greetings, friends of the savoury palate. There are more or less three
different stylistic methods concerning food ingestion: 1. orderly
consumption; 2. suffering through some form of diet and; 3. a balanced
feast. The Wighnomy Brothers of Jena have applied the latter, not only to
the taking in of nature=92s fruitage, but by applying this also to their da=
ily
intake of music. Next is to deftly inform the rest of the world. Hereby the=
y
purloin not only the vinyl classics of others, but keep to the ultimate aim
of keeping their own irons in the forge. The two, tone-artists junkies Gabo=
r
Schablitzki (alias Robag Wruhme) and Soeren Bodner (alias Monkey Maffia),
react to and revolve around the verbal confrontation. Both tap into you,
starting stealthily as a mere bud in your soul, which eventually conquers
your musical devotion. It all began with blond perms, armbands, striped
stretch pants, heavy (emphasis on heavy) metal and everything that goes wit=
h
that image. Actually, that is just a collection of lies told with a sigh an=
d
a smile. The two buddies=92s got to know each other in 1988 while break
dancing. The way it happens with some adolescents, the different music
styles that passed through their eardrums started with Hip Hop, early
electronica of every colour, ambient, house, techno, jazz, funk, and even
alternative/independent rock. Both soon concluded that the true sound
aesthetic is far away from the instruments; at full blast it is only what
pours out of the grooves in the vinyl. This being the case, the established
=93Phonothek=94 absorbs, selects and then releases product. The first refug=
e:
Gabor stood in the mid-90=92s as =93The Chill-Out DJ=94, behind the decks o=
n many
a relaxing floor of mother earth. In the meantime he played with Herbie
Hancock and stood as a virtuoso in a keyboard shop. In 1996 with Volker Kah=
l
he started the project =93Beefcake=94. With his, rather experimental but
simultaneously harmonious, electronica-devoted release he had notched his
own international respect. Until 1997, Gabor & Soeren dashed through the
Thuringian club and party scene, and are currently residents in the renowne=
d
Club Kassablanca in Jena. However only since April 97 they are known as the
Wighnomy Brothers. Since the founding of the Freude am Tanzen label,
business has steadily improved. Of course, not without the stumbling blocks
and setbacks that happen with marketing mechanisms. However, in accord with
the motto =93Stehter Tropfen h=F6hlt den Stein=94 (words of wisdom which me=
an when
translated, steady drops will drill a hole in stone), the FAT vehicle with
the Wighnomy Brothers steam engine stays on track. Also, for the last two
years there is the added train car called Musikkrause and, the friendly
collaboration with the Cologne based Kompakt stable must also be mentioned
here. The always multifaceted style of the WB=92s has been further develope=
d
through club experience, production, and still more flavour expansion
efforts. This all brings a functional kick with the ever-present view to th=
e
thoroughly rocked dance floor. Originally, they were native to deep and
traditional house together with Latin, vocal, and Nujazz flavouring. The
musical spectrum lying between advanced in the direction of =93raving with
reason=94. Therefore, stirring, intelligent, technotronic, wide ranging dan=
ce
music of incalculable worth to body and soul welcomes you. Everything out o=
f
the speakers goes straight to the bones, bringing your blood to a boil
whether minimal, bounce, shuffling, break, or jazzed tracks. Both gentlemen
are solo artists: Robag Wruhme (also as producer) and Monkey Maffia,
allowing (when the =93blessed union=94 is on hiatus) both gentlemen the lib=
erty
to give and receive unique inspirations. This serves the Wighnomy Brothers
the benefit of bringing fresh impressions to the table when collaborating.
Monkey-Soeren is also the owner of the Fatplastics recordstore in Jena:
quite the ideal refuge and communications platform. Wodka raus, Wighnomy
frei!!! (Break out the vodka, Wighnomy is free!!!)

Not a rave, but tonight's the Dorkbot SF 7 year anniversary:  http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsf/

I was planning to go to this, but my energy is fading...

Mezzanine, Rock It Science, and Prismatic Present:

Green Velvet & Designer Drugs

Mezzanine, Rock It Science and Prismatic are proud to announce a rare SF
appearance and the debut Mezzanine performance of the one and only Green
Velvet, one of dance music's legendary figures. Green Velvet's labels Cajual
and Relief have had a major impact on electronic music, and he has produced
huge tracks such as The Percolator, La La Land, and Shake & Pop since the
beginning of the rave scene with no sign of slowing down today. Green Velvet
will be joined by Designer Drugs, one of the hottest up and coming acts in
the United States signed to LA electro stalwart iHeartcomix Records. The
pairing of these two headliners - spanning old school and new school - is a
combination that one does not get the opportunity to experience every
weekend, backed up by some of the top local talent SF has to offer: Richie
Panic of Blow Up throwing down a special birthday set, Rock It Science
founder and Flavor Group resident DJ Eric Sharp, and Prismatic founder
Andrew Phelan.

Featuring:

Green Velvet (Relief Records, Cajual - Chicago)

Designer Drugs (iHeartcomix - NYC)

Richie Panic (Blow Up) - Special Birthday Set

Eric Sharp (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Andrew Phelan (Prismatic, Drop Music)

About the DJs:

Green Velvet (Relief Records, Cajual - Chicago)

Few artists have the ability to produce timeless music that can cross genre
barriers and be enjoyed by listeners with diverse musical interests. Green
Velvet is one of these few. Producing under the Green Velvet moniker as well
as his alter ego Cajmere, Curtis A. Jones has released a steady stream of
dance floor aimed tracks since 1991. His discography boasts many impressive
contributions to dance music: Flash, Answering Machine, (It's Time For) The
Percolator, La La Land, Shake & Pop and many others. Curtis' ear for great
music put him at the forefront of two seminal labels in Chicago: Cajual
Records and Relief Records. These labels hosted his original works as well
as other renowned artists such as Armand Van Helden, DJ Sneak, Dajae, Johnny
Fiasco, Roy Davis Jr., Mark Grant, Gene Farris and more. Green Velvet is
usually found traveling across the globe to perform at festivals and huge
clubs but June 20th he will make a rare West Coast appearance at Mezzanine,
playing a DJ set while singing some of his original works.

Designer Drugs (iHeartcomix - NYC)

Designer Drugs is a New York based electro-house duo focused on making
stadium rocking bangers. Currently, Designer Drugs is releasing remixes for
artists such as Little Boots (Iamsound Records), The Veronicas (Warner
Brothers), Thieves Like Us (Kitsune), Jupiter One (Warner Brothers),
HeartsRevolution (iheartcomix), Mission Control (Etc, Etc), Freezepop
(Warner Brothers), Hail Social (Flaming Hotz), Protokol (iheartcomix, over
500,000 copies distributed on CD via Scion), IAMX (formerly of The Sneaker
Pimps), and Fake Shark - Real Zombie. Michael Patrick, Designer Drugs'
DJ/Frontman has over 11 years experience and the ability to read and work
any crowd. It will be a treat to have him rocking the dance floor.

Richie Panic (Blow Up) - Special Birthday Set

There are few names in San Francisco that are more synonymous with cutting
edge music than Richie Panic. Richie and partner Jeffrey Paradise were the
architects of the legendary weekly Frisco Disco event which drew huge crowds
every Saturday night for 6 years. Richie is presently a resident DJ at Blow
Up, one of the most talked about parties in SF, and also takes time to DJ at
many of the hottest parties in the US. Richie will definitely be bringing
the heat for this special set as he is celebrating his birthday with us.

Eric Sharp (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Rock It Science founder and Flavor Group resident Eric Sharp's ascent to the
forefront of dance music can only be described as meteoric. From working
countless dance floors into frenzies at clubs, events, and festivals across
the US and the globe to producing some of San Francisco's most epic parties,
Eric's endless energy and dedication is simply contagious. Mr. Sharp has
already achieved great success as a dj, producer and promoter alike, keeping
everyone dancing until the sun comes up. The mastermind behind the Rock It
Science movement never disappoints, dropping diverse, cutting edge,
energetic sets that feature massive remixes, heavy bass lines, original
tracks, yet to be released hits and other surprises.

Andrew Phelan (Prismatic, Drop Music)

Since moving from Chicago in 2001, Andrew Phelan has quickly made his mark
on San Francisco. From regular appearances at SF hot spots such as Vessel,
Harlot and Temple, to his extremely popular Tonal afterhours parties, Andrew
can be heard laying down his infectious mix of deep, soulful, funky, and
tech based house music every week in the city. Just as comfortable in the
studio as behind the decks, Andrew has put out releases on some of the most
respected labels in house, including Drop Music, Eight-Tracks, So Sound, and
his own label, Prismatic Tracks. Working with partner Origami out of San
Francisco's famed Moulton Studios complex, his music has landed on the
charts and playlists of Radio 1, Kiss FM, Mark Farina, Jay-J, Laurent
Garnier, Funk D'Void, Luke Solomon, Colette, Robert Owens and Roger Sanchez
to name but a few.

Thank you Peter!

i couldn't believe the turnout for starscape this year.  it used to be 
massive but then it peaked and got thinner for a while, but this year 
everyone - new young, old school and in-between - came out of the 
woodwork!

it did my heart a lot of good to see it!  <3

cycles, i guess!

thanks and all best,
mary :)

OK, I don't know how real this is but...

http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20090611005958&newsLang=en

Some claim that weed smokers get cold sand respiratory infections less often and less severely than non-smokers.  Will be interesting to see if the science might actually support a health claim that most consider to be a myth.

	by the way, my band is playing.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello sfravers, it's been a while! I come to you seeking help.

Does anyone have a Serato hub they would let me borrow tomorrow night?

My band Easystreet is playing a show at LiPo in Chinatown tomorrow night,
and the DJ who is opening for us had a Serato-related mishap today; his
Serato box died.  Somehow, although I feel my social circles are built
mostly of DJs, I wasn't sure who to ask to borrow one from. So I thought I'd
try you guys. Anyone? Will trade for hugs and hi-fives.

The show goes from 9pm-1:30am. We could probably have the DJ play just early
in the night, so you could take your Serato hub home at 11pm and not have to
hang out all night (unless you would like to hang out all night!)  It should
be a fun party. There will be balloons and flashy lights and slightly
obnoxious dance pop music (courtesy of Easystreet).

So, here's the info for the show... you know, in case someone wants to come.
;)

EASYSTREET live!

Seizure-inducing light amazingness by Donnie Service
LiPo Lounge, 916 Grant, San Francisco

Thanks in advance if anyone can help me out...  And, maybe I will see you
tomorrow? I'm moving back to Berlin (again) next week so this is my last
performance in SF for a while.

Love Chelsea

Haight Ashbury Street Fair
June 14th, 2009
11:00AM - 5:30PM

The Haight Ashbury Street Fair is the City's longest running annual
day time event. It started during a time when San Fancisco was at the
height of it's artistic diversity in music, art, and fashion. When The
City was filled with so much political oppression, this fair was born
to remind San Franciscans that with the joys of life, there was still
some hope in humanity left. That hope has been a contination of growth
and inspiration since then, not only to the City itself, but to the
whole SF Bay Area and beyond! For the past three decades, the Fair has
carried on that tradition to celebrate, share, and spread the Love for
life. Become part of this annual landmark event and enjoy a day in the
sun (please please please let the sun shine & no rain) in the Upper
Haight.

-There will be a variety of booths for food, clothes, jewelry, bags,
dance lessons, palm reading, charity organizations, pet supplies and
everything you think you didn't need, but so glad you found!

-Get your groove on to the live music at the Stanyan stage and the
Masonic stage!

-Mingle with hundreds of other people in search of that "Groovy"
Haight/ Ashbury energy & fun in the sun!
---------------------------------------

Now this is the 5th Year that Groundscore has been in charge of the
Masonic stage... for some reason or another, we always seem to top the
year before with something big, different, new, and even strange (like
The Grannies from last year or the s & m anime girls who danced with
monsters on stage the year prior ;n)

Scheduled to perform are:
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-
ok.. due to certain ummm.. well.. i was just told by the organizers
('cause they caught my earlier BSPs & posting performers was a huge no
no) that you have to come & see who performing, & well.. just come!!!!
We're gonna have bad ass bands performing & dope ass DJs spinning on
my stage is all I'm really allowed to say.. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!
There's gonna be equally slammin' stuff goin on at the Stanyon stage
too ;n) Oh yeah.. DJ's will be dropping Jungle, breaks, house & more
edm yummy.. so yeah :)
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-

So I reeeeeally hope to see some of y'all there... & if when you get
to my stage, please don't hesitate to pull me aside to say YO! I'm
sure I'll be running around like a chicken with it's head cut off most
the whole day, so greetings, hugz, distractions, gropes, ass smacks
are all more than welcome!!! :n)

Peace=3D->
Just Me=3D->

Subject: [sfraves] Ride to Stilldream??

--0-1734727571-1244862240=:44132
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi everybody,
So I really want to go to stilldream, but I just moved here a month ago and I don't know anyone that is going and I don't have my own car. So, if there is any friendly soul out there who is going and has an extra space, I would be more than happy to pitch in for gas and what not if I could catch a ride there and back. I'd be so grateful!! I'm very friendly and just really want to go experience an outdoor, electronica music event like this. I live right in the heart of downtown and I could meet you wherever. email me if there's a chance and ill find you on facebook or plurlife or something so im not a total stranger. peace and love
Paul

My favorite part about all of these pictures of "increasing novelty" is that they are completely bogus, but they are all bogus in somewhat different interesting ways.  I love the goofy caveman guy on the right in this one that seems like he should be smoking a fatty.

Is universal novelty really increasing in any meaningful global sense as McKenna opined or are we really just a bunch of egotistical monkeys amusing ourselves with somewhat heavier rocks and somewhat pointier sticks?

I wonder.

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Novelty and the pace of change

My favorite part about all of these pictures of "increasing novelty" is that they are completely bogus, but they are all bogus in somewhat different interesting ways.  I love the goofy caveman guy on the right in this one that seems like he should be smoking a fatty.

Is universal novelty really increasing in any meaningful global sense as McKenna opined or are we really just a bunch of egotistical monkeys amusing ourselves with somewhat heavier rocks and somewhat pointier sticks?

I wonder.

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hello World!

I was on SCR for a couple years in the late 90's when I was 
pulling double duty between Socal/Bay Area during college.

Cool people, fun parties :-)

I don't expect a lot of people here will be going to EDC, but 
c'mon it's summer, does anyone here got anything planned?

I plan to check out Brass Tax on friday, might be doing visuals 
for Green Velvet on Sat, and I know a bunch of people going to 
Stilldream this weekend. Anyone else doing something exciting in 
the coming weekends?

Didn't McKenna admit the whole timewave zero thing to be a hoax?

(Speaking of: Spacetime Continuum vs. Terrence McKenna.)

I'm not exactly feelin' up to par at the moment, so please excuse my rather
short review.
Always nice to party at the Bordello, and Denise brought along a nice crowd.
 However, I wasn't really feelin the electro house n nu skools breaks that
were being dropped most of the time I was there.  I did catch some of MOD's
set who was laying down some really nice deep n funky house right before I
left.  If you get a chance, you need to party at this spot before it's gone.
 I believe there's a party happening there this weekend, might be Beats for
Peace, correct me if I'm wrong.

Ben

Subject: Re: [sfraves] New SFPD Chief Announced

I definitely felt it was pretty strange when I heard the news last
night.  I mean, Mesa is ultra conservative, so why chose a police
chief from there for "liberal" S.F?  (I put liberal in quotes since SF
is getting more and more conservative by the day, and Newsom is one
himself.)  But reading the article I'm not as cynical as I initially
was.  Hoping he stays in line with "liberal" SF.

hey y'all,

i'm gonna be in Houston all summer, living for cheap with my family what
with my lack of a job and 1 more year of classes at Stanford I have to find
some way to pay for.  i was just wondering if any of you know people in the
breaks scene down here (or Austin, San Antonio, or even Dallas for that
matter) and could connect me with them.  it's killing me to be out of the
bay, but it's a perfect opportunity to make new friends and expand my
networks.

thanks a ton,
Mojo

Subject: [sfraves] My Weekend Reveiw: The Long Ass Sat Night Errand & HSF

So in short, just to clarify maybe some misunderstood points of this story & what who's why where & how... I was all set to like just stay home Saturday night & chill, get my rest, try harder than hell to get some ZZZZs... I mean, i was suppose to support like the BADNB crew, reunite w/ some old skool SF Junglists who were in town, & dance my ass off, but it just didn't make sense to like spend the 3-4 hours after it was over doin' a gypsy raver adventure, then meet up @ Masonic & Haight w/ the Groundscore Masonic Stage crew 6-7 AM & go on from there with the whole day kinda dealie...

So I stayed home just talkin' to my Homies around the world, whatever, editting pixes, yada yada yada... then around like 9:45PM, phone rings, it was my Homie Ryan, the 1st thing he tells me is that he's thinking of converting into a Scientologist & he was drunk & he ummm... wanted to hang out w/ snow white... so I called everywhere looking for her, paging her, IMing her, nothing... then I found out she might be kickin' it in Concord @ this small lil "jungle" party @ the venue where I helped out w/ that hip hop party indy la la la thingie... well.. we got there @ 11PM, hopin' to see her kickin' it, ummm, we didn't see her 'til almost 5AM...

Got home around almost 5:30AM... tried to cat nap, power disco nap, nothing, so around like an episode of Chalk Zone on Nickalodean & Lilo & Stich on Disney, I got ready... lol.. I always feel bad for askin' my Dad to drive me to the City the morning of HSF, but he did, & took Mom too :)  LoL!  But yeah.. ok.. it's like 7:45-8AM & there's already problems, the stage set up guys fucked up the speaker stand foundations & had to fix it, we had no rope, & just alota lil things.. but alota lil things that early in the morn always stress out Felix (The Dog) & he starts hella buggin'.. dMarie kinda went back to her hotel down the street to get ready for a few hours & yeah... we kinda like had to get all those lil wrinkles of set up like hella mondo ironed out, which eventually did :)  Oh yeah.. I recuited my Homie Glue who said he'd be soo down to help this year!!!

Early morn still tryin' to wake the fuck up

Felix The Dog & Brian waiting for ummm... something for set up

Glue (mohawk) & the guy who helped with booking the stage this year
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3632903803_eb8a674acf.jpg

The 1st band that went on was this ummm... 3 peice spanish guitar folk music group, the 2nd band was this like 8 horn peice mariachi band w/ a bass drum player & a singer... then pretty much after that, all the bands were rock bands...

There was this one group though, they weren't rock, there were like this electro hip hop duo called Hottub :)  LoL.. if you like remember L'Trimm who did "Cars That Go Boom", well... their music was like kinda in the same kinda fun way Cars was... it was Cute, they even brought up a lil girl to help them sing 1 of their songs :)

http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3638/3638522424_2d35064e44.jpg

But yeah.. I mean.. it was an Awesome fuckin' day... there was alota live band music I didn't really care for, like that emo pretty boy, emo 90's rock band 'cause like every song they performed was a fuckin' 80s hair band power ballad, cry me a fuckin' river, whoa is me shit almost... but their music was good in terms of like structure & shit I guess....



In between the bands, of course we had DJs like we do every year, but I mean, like ok... we only had 4 DJs: Felix The Dog, Qzen, Fil Latimore, & Nader... & instead of like goin' all the around the EDM gambit w/ the Jungle, Breaks, Dubstep, & all that yummy... all they played was House.. not that I minded 'cause I still got my Groovy on when possible when they spun, but it was just weird, & also the 1st year we didn't have a Jungle DJ... but the Belly Dancer during Nader's set was yummy too :)  But yeah, as soon as the DJ started spinning, then we had to unload off stage the last band's equiptment & reload the new band's stuff on stage 'cause we only had 20 minutes to do it...

http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2483/3632904179_173210670e.jpg

Other than all that, socially, it was like a fuckin' family reunion, like hella old school junglists from back in the day popped up, & like i said earlier a few were back from the West Coast (Kimba (who's also an SFR alum) & MC Lyndsey), so I mean, like in those terms, it just made the day perfect :)  Yeah.. & like it was Groovy seein' all teh ravers pass by to hang out too, lol, by the backstage barrier & stuff & have some chats :)  I think the only one I saw from SFR was JC (YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY, so good seeing you)

http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3322/3632904445_9d19bb70c2.jpg

OH yeah... the closing band was Death Angel & oooooooooooooh.. they totally fuckin' rocked man... I mean.. they totally played alota their old skool trash metal & I mean.... it just got me like pumped 'cause I ain't heard them play in forever... like they wre the perfect band to close our staage!  I mean.. I've known the lead singer & most of the guys for like hella years now 'cause back in the day, like I used to hang out with them in South City 'cause my cousin's best friend used to date 1 of them.. but yeah.. it was just soooo fitting what I was feeling at that moment, which was sleep dep crazy cracked out blarg blarg...

http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3647/3637123928_1ac6682679.jpg
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3327/3636309125_7218cf8640.jpg
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3661/3637124154_f62a572ae0.jpg

Yeah.. then we like had to hardcore clean up after that as much as possible b4 like the soound guys & stage building guys deconstructed everything & well... me & dM just always have like closure moments where like we re-asure each other that we're fuck'in crazy for doing this, but Loving every second of the fuckin' mayhem of it all & recoup for the next year ;)

http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3387/3630231566_54ed88f62e.jpg

Oh, but the story don't end there yet... like ok.. so I always had like the idea in my head that I was just gonna wait 'til the next morning to get home via BART & i'd somehow get my way around the City doing whatever & maybe drugs to keep me up, but Glue said he'd bring me home after we wre done... so like I was like hella excited i didn't have to do a GRA after HSF!!  OK.. now here's where things get crazy... Glue somehow started talkin' to this Russian Girl & they were hella kickin' it... so like I cleaned up as much as possible 'cause I thought Glue wanted to like leave & said my byes to everyone... next thing I know, a 6 pack was bought & we're up on Hippy Hill drinking beer & smokin' green.. well they were, i was just drinkin' a Coke & lyin' down on the grass de-fuckin-compressing...

Soon we had this crew of people around us.... it started out me, Glue, the Russian Chica, & her brother... then these 2 BFF Underage Girlies join us tryin' to convince us that they weren't Lesbian Lovers, but they liked kissing, which they have done a few times in front of us, then these like high school boys who were heeeeeeeeeeeella rollin' join us too & the only plus to that for me was they Loved Happy Hardcore ('cause I got to show them pixes of me & Big Bro Briskie from my bag) & Skills Pop a few weeks back was their 1st party... lol.. but yeah... them dudes were hella funny & gnawing the fuck outta their jaws!!!  Oh My Goodness man, Hello 2day, it was just soo funny & I was delerious from the almost 48 hours of no sleep sober awakedness state, that everything those teenyboppers were talkin' about was sooo funny man!!

We ended up chillin' on hippy hill for like almost 2 hours then well... I was taken hom through the Mondo Yummy graciousness of Glue... didn't help that I was sitting in the back seat 'cause he knows that i get car sick in the back seat, oh yeah, Russian Chica rode with us 'cause i guess, well, right before we left Hippy Hill, Glue was chillin' in between her legs with his shirt off & she was "massaging" his shoulders *rolls eyes* LoL, so yeah, he drove me all the way to Hercules, then i guess he took her back to his pad in Freemont & they had the sex they tried to have on Hippy Hill...

But yeah... my sleeps all off as usual, & even more so now 'cause of the weekend, so I just had to get in this WR while it was still fresh in my brain... yes yes yes, i know, I have alot to catch up on still!!! :)

Love U all!!!

Peace=->
Just Me=->

Mezzanine, Rock It Science, and Prismatic Present:

Green Velvet & Designer Drugs

Mezzanine, Rock It Science and Prismatic are proud to announce a rare SF
appearance and the debut Mezzanine performance of the one and only Green
Velvet, one of dance music's legendary figures. Green Velvet's labels Cajual
and Relief have had a major impact on electronic music, and he has produced
huge tracks such as The Percolator, La La Land, and Shake & Pop since the
beginning of the rave scene with no sign of slowing down today. Green Velvet
will be joined by Designer Drugs, one of the hottest up and coming acts in
the United States signed to LA electro stalwart iHeartcomix Records. The
pairing of these two headliners - spanning old school and new school - is a
combination that one does not get the opportunity to experience every
weekend, backed up by some of the top local talent SF has to offer: Richie
Panic of Blow Up throwing down a special birthday set, Rock It Science
founder and Flavor Group resident DJ Eric Sharp, and Prismatic founder
Andrew Phelan.

About the DJs:

Green Velvet (Relief Records, Cajual - Chicago)

Few artists have the ability to produce timeless music that can cross genre
barriers and be enjoyed by listeners with diverse musical interests. Green
Velvet is one of these few. Producing under the Green Velvet moniker as well
as his alter ego Cajmere, Curtis A. Jones has released a steady stream of
dance floor aimed tracks since 1991. His discography boasts many impressive
contributions to dance music: Flash, Answering Machine, (It's Time For) The
Percolator, La La Land, Shake & Pop and many others. Curtis' ear for great
music put him at the forefront of two seminal labels in Chicago: Cajual
Records and Relief Records. These labels hosted his original works as well
as other renowned artists such as Armand Van Helden, DJ Sneak, Dajae, Johnny
Fiasco, Roy Davis Jr., Mark Grant, Gene Farris and more. Green Velvet is
usually found traveling across the globe to perform at festivals and huge
clubs but June 20th he will make a rare West Coast appearance at Mezzanine,
playing a DJ set while singing some of his original works.

Designer Drugs (iHeartcomix - NYC)

Designer Drugs is a New York based electro-house duo focused on making
stadium rocking bangers. Currently, Designer Drugs is releasing remixes for
artists such as Little Boots (Iamsound Records), The Veronicas (Warner
Brothers), Thieves Like Us (Kitsune), Jupiter One (Warner Brothers),
HeartsRevolution (iheartcomix), Mission Control (Etc, Etc), Freezepop
(Warner Brothers), Hail Social (Flaming Hotz), Protokol (iheartcomix, over
500,000 copies distributed on CD via Scion), IAMX (formerly of The Sneaker
Pimps), and Fake Shark - Real Zombie. Michael Patrick, Designer Drugs'
DJ/Frontman has over 11 years experience and the ability to read and work
any crowd. It will be a treat to have him rocking the dance floor.

Richie Panic (Blow Up) - Special Birthday Set

There are few names in San Francisco that are more synonymous with cutting
edge music than Richie Panic. Richie and partner Jeffrey Paradise were the
architects of the legendary weekly Frisco Disco event which drew huge crowds
every Saturday night for 6 years. Richie is presently a resident DJ at Blow
Up, one of the most talked about parties in SF, and also takes time to DJ at
many of the hottest parties in the US. Richie will definitely be bringing
the heat for this special set as he is celebrating his birthday with us.

Eric Sharp (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Rock It Science founder and Flavor Group resident Eric Sharp's ascent to the
forefront of dance music can only be described as meteoric. From working
countless dance floors into frenzies at clubs, events, and festivals across
the US and the globe to producing some of San Francisco's most epic parties,
Eric's endless energy and dedication is simply contagious. Mr. Sharp has
already achieved great success as a dj, producer and promoter alike, keeping
everyone dancing until the sun comes up. The mastermind behind the Rock It
Science movement never disappoints, dropping diverse, cutting edge,
energetic sets that feature massive remixes, heavy bass lines, original
tracks, yet to be released hits and other surprises.

Andrew Phelan (Prismatic, Drop Music)

Since moving from Chicago in 2001, Andrew Phelan has quickly made his mark
on San Francisco. From regular appearances at SF hot spots such as Vessel,
Harlot and Temple, to his extremely popular Tonal afterhours parties, Andrew
can be heard laying down his infectious mix of deep, soulful, funky, and

One late-breaking addition to the BSP that SFR will no doubt appreciate:
ocul8r is excited and honored to be joined on the projectors by Viberation,

One more reason to come out early...

Think of this:
You pickup a flyer, or see it on a site,"60,000 Volts, 60,000 Decibles
                    &
  The World at it's Darkest"

2 bart trains, 0130 till 0400, Everyone rallys at 0100 around 16th mission
bart station in coats and shit. Station doors open, everyone piles in at
0110 and the trains take off, music pumping throughout the cars, this is
just the start, everyone hunkers down packed in like sardines. Trains stop
at the fremont station, one on each side so no one can get to the shocky
rails. Doors open and fog rolls in pooring into the cars, lasers, lights,
music pumping, party roars, all the gates are shut upstairs, no way out or
in, the music is beautiful, the lights are epic, the fog is eternal and
everything rolls together. At 0400 everyone piles into the trains, they take
off for 16th mission, dump everyone, and head back for millbrae where the
full evac happens.

As for putting the internet on the street. That could be bad ass, any ideas
on location and implimentation?

Gavin's reply was: "Have not asked" -- I think that's fair enough for now
because the reports on the Portuguese success with eliminating prohibition
have only come to light in the U.S. and BBC very recently.

Please everyone keep tweeting to @GavinNewsom asking how many peaceful
prohibition victims should be in the jails and courts so overburdened with
violent offenders.  Ask him for a quantatative proportion if he tries to
waffle.

If he sends you a private reply, please share it -- he is a public figure
after all. Retweet and post here please.

He is very sensitive about his twitter image and does in fact respond well
on twitter in my limited experience.

Cheers,
J.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: Sunday! AFTERGLOW: an evening of mellow electronics w/ Alland 
	Byallo + Craig Kuna

--000e0cd6ac8ee49373046cb84a33
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Afterglow was conceived as a chance to wind down after a long weekend by
listening to some chill music and having a few drinks with friends. The idea
is to allow some of SF's most talented and multi-faceted dance music DJ's an
opportunity to dig deeper into their collections and play music they
wouldn't be able to in a club setting. Anything's game, from ambient and
electronica to dub techno, idm, atmospheric drum & bass, downtempo, future
jazz, deep house and beyond.

__________________________________________________


Special guests for Sunday, June 21st are [KONTROL] Freqs:


ALLAND BYALLO  (kontrol . nightlight)

&

CRAIG  KUNA  (kontrol . platform)


We're not sure exactly what Alland has in store, but Craig is planning a
special set of uber-deep Basic Channel-style dub techno.  He's got quite an
incredible collection of this stuff and really plays it well. Warming things
up for the [KONTROL] boys will be none other than the event's founder, Greg
Bird, playing a wide assortment of well-chilled electronic goodies.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Global Street Party??? Rave Style on the Costumes and
 Music Floor Formats...

wow this one was funny. but it does come from somewhere. a bit of civil 
disobedience is what its about. i'm thinkin our man eric had the idea 
from michael alig when  he got a bunch of club kids to mob the new york 
subway with a boombox flash mob style. clara the chicken was there.

this was similar to alig's mcdonald's party
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTbXTTE8i8&feature=related

actually flash mobs are a good way to revitalize the scene i feel but 
pimp and ho parties are just plain dumb and zero class. i'd rather do a 
convoy of cars blasting all the same music or a bus convoy of burner 
buses with onboard soundsystems stopping at random parts of the city to 
get out and dance with a CD/ Traktor dj in each or a dj in the lead bus 
with a radio transmitter. all this which would not necessarily be 
illegal if you kept your sound from bleeding from the bus and if you 
looked into the loopholes of the law's moving violations for a party 
like this.

there are several buses that already do this quite legally and make 
money doing it. the party trolley that serves alcohol on board with a 
license usually has a bunch of drunk yuppies hanging off of it blasting 
music and also there's the mexican bus equipped with its own soundsystem 
heading off to art galleries.

my supposition is that one could find themselves on a nice deserted 
freeway somewhere in central california with a gang of buses with their 
windows blacked out busting some serious music with 50-70 kids having 
quite the best time of their damned lives. i'm sure i'm not the only one 
who's thought of this one. digital DJing makes this party more of a 
likelyhood than ever before. also i've heard of rest stop parties in 
germany where this goes off.

the issues behind a party like this would only be finding drivers with 
chaffeur's licenses (craigslist) and the proper buses with enough power 
for a small but decent mackie system each. also making these buses 
street legal could be of a small yet, doable concern.

i still kind of want to throw renegades for a few hours at a time out of 
the back of a uhaul in deserted points of the city. this is sort of like 
an extended flash mob with map points and or SMS. cops tell you to 
leave, don't worry the next map point is open at 4 am (sorry dj smurfboy 
your set was cut short by the law). i'm down to collab if anyone is 
willing to throw down but my soundsystem is too big.

this is true raver spirit... whining about the law & cops, extolling the 
virtues of pimp & ho balls and oldschoolers excluding younger ravers by 
saying "fuck you"  is not. imagination and creativity in the scene is 
definitely lacking so let's do something about it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Global Street Party??? Rave Style on the Costumes and

as for putting the internet on the street.. it would be nice to see some 
people doing some chalking again. free internet points around the city 
to DL info music and map points. that sounds like fun to me. good thing 
net pcs are taking off like gangbusters. i see more and more of those 
net pcs everywhere i go. just today i saw a 6'8" man, huge broad 
shoulders who obviously needed glasses but was too macho for it (yet not 
too macho for the pink dress shirt) hunching over this tiny notebook, 
hunting and pecking through his lunchtime work. something about that is 
kind of funny to me.

but yeah let's get fuckin creative about raves is the rallying cry eric 
is talking about. the way you have to do it has to be savvy though. one 
thing about ravers or at least good ravers is that they never do 
anything half assed. mostly because speakers and fines can be a really 
heavy weight to bear.

respect,

sean.

Then just do it.

But really right about now is sort of the worst time in a long while (at least in my pre-coffee memory) to try some poorly thought out crazy ass shit around here.  Trust me on this.  Its not just an old schooler peeing on your parade.  

Lots of parties have been getting shut down.  No one in LE willing to talk about what's going down,  New chief in town.  Its bad mojo.

Time to lay low and enjoy some summer outdoor action in GGP and elsewhere around the bay.  Things are just starting to heat up and we've got BM and Lovefest ahead.  Be creative, but remember "the first duty of the revolutionary is to get away with it."

Best,

Peter

I like the idea of renegade drive-in movies-  but with music instead  
of films.

Does it still count as a rave if everyone's in their car listening to  
the DJ on their FM radio?

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: Tonight! AFTERGLOW: an evening of mellow electronics w/ Alland 
	Byallo + Craig Kuna

Hope y'all can make it down tonight for some pretty electronic listening
music. It's fun, mellow and FREE.

----> G



Afterglow was conceived as a chance to wind down after a long weekend by
listening to some chill music and having a few drinks with friends. The idea
is to allow some of SF's most talented and multi-faceted dance music DJ's an
opportunity to dig deeper into their collections and play music they
wouldn't be able to in a club setting. Anything's game, from ambient and
electronica to dub techno, idm, atmospheric drum & bass, downtempo, future
jazz, deep house and beyond.

__________________________________________________


Special guests for Sunday, June 21st are [KONTROL] Freqs:


ALLAND BYALLO  (kontrol . nightlight)

&

CRAIG  KUNA  (kontrol . platform)


We're not sure exactly what Alland has in store, but Craig is planning a
special set of uber-deep Basic Channel-style dub techno.  He's got quite an
incredible collection of this stuff and really plays it well. Warming things
up for the [KONTROL] boys will be none other than the event's founder, Greg
Bird, playing a wide assortment of well-chilled electronic goodies.

here's my set from Afterglow last night.
the first half or so is reeeally mellow, then it picks up a bit towards the
end.

as i am not a DJ, there is no "mixing" going on here. strictly radio DJ
style.

should be pleasant for chill-out, come-down, or nappy-time affairs.

hope you enjoy.

I used to know Terrence back in the 70s before he got famous, and can tell
you that he didn't really believe all that timewave zero and machine elves
and singularity/philosopher's stone stuff he used to rap about. All that
stuff was just the attractive, glittery wrapper to get people's attention,
while he put out his more interesting and substantial ideas. Somebody called
him a "trickster" and that about sums it up. He maybe half believed it... He
did love to speculate, though, and nothing wrong with that. Man that guy had
the gift of storytelling - he kissed the Blarney Stone for certain. Sad he
died before seeing how it all turned out. Don't take him too seriously - he
didn't take himself too seriously, and always kept his salt-shaker handy.

Today's treat is brought to you from Toby Roberts in Arizona.
He found an old Vault tape from 1992 and recorded it down to put on the int=
ernets for us to download and enjoy.

For those that weren't around=2C The Vault was located on F street right ne=
xt to the 5th column and was (along with Tracks and 5th column) one of the =
first clubs to play techno.
This tape was a huge influence on my early beginnings as a DJ=2C because it=
 was literally the only mixtape out there for a year(mixtapes were really r=
eally hard to come by back then).
The quality is kinda crappy=2C but the tape is really old so you can't expe=
ct too much here=2C however the music was groundbreaking back then.
btw=2C if anyone wants to play "lets figure out the names of these tracks" =
let me know. I have a couple of em=2C but would love to know the names of t=
he rest of the tunes.

The tape is by Deckmaster Pascal and it's called Phunctions Phit Phor Pharo=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Global Street Party??? Rave Style on the Costumes and
 Music Floor Formats...

i like this idea ALOT. there are alot of  drive ins in need of cash. i'd 
like to see music videos instead of films or vjing. call it a screening. 
i'm in love with it. let's f'n do this. this looks like a loop hole in 
the rave act to me. possibly someone could get hooked up with a pioneer 
DVJ - X1 DVD turntable 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPhf-7KxCYI&feature=related
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2-ILx8RY7E
the effect could be also similar to EBN's style of music production.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg6qSGXGvq8 (my favorite EBN song/ 
video.  just to warn: there's some strobing in effect here, but its a 
little irregular.)

i wonder how we can scheme to pull this off. the only drive in i know of 
is off the 880 near coliseum where they host swap meets. but it looks 
very run down.

it may be interesting to see if ben stokes would DJ/VJ at this one. not 
to mench some other djs and VJs there could be some interest in this if 
we get the right people together. `;)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:: Faktion 6.26.9 Perla : STML : Disconnect

flyer link : 
http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/101/l_59952534d6d848d3aced98b9561cc94f.jpg

WHO:: Perla :: STML :: Disconnect
WHAT:: Faktion
WHEN:: 6.26.9 9PM-2AM PST
WHERE:: ANU @ 46 6th ST. SF and Live Online:: http://radio.defsf.com:1200/
WHY:: Faktion again brings you some of the best trueschool techno from 
some of the best in the bay to SF and beyond. We are coming together to 
bid a fond farewell to our friend and one of the best techno producers 
the bay has seen in quite some time, Perla. Juan Valverde aka Perla's 
work has been recently featured on Bay Area imprints Auralism records 
(http://www.auralismrecords.com/artists/perla.html) and Ruoho Ruotsi's 
De'fchild records (http://www.defchild.com/releases.php?id=dcp011). We 
are sad to see him return to his native Spain but it is not like us here 
at Faktion to be sad but to celebrate our existence while we may. So 
please joins us for one last hurrah for our compatriot Perla and also 
his lovely wife Isabel. They will surely be missed.

Also in full support will be Faktion Rezzies and DEF Heads STML and 
Disconnect.

STML (Short Term Memory Loss) has been laying low (possibly stewing) for 
the past few months or so but can always be counted on to deliver 
something fresh and innovative from his Traktor based sets. His sets 
have always been unparalleled, utilizing a flawless subtractive mixing 
technique and excellent selection.

http://www.defsf.com/people/stml

Disconnect is something of a luddite's dream and hard techno fan's 
fantasy. For this month's Faktion, Disconnect will be pushing out 
another all vinyl set of deep groovy tracks iced in melodic, tribal and 
minimal percussive elements.

http://www.defsf.com/people/disconnect

HOW:: Faktion is brought to you consistently and lovingly by Ray and 
internationally by DEF's Radio Integrated every 3rd friday of the month.

Since practically every Rave on this SfRaves List is Commercial - I say we
this too,  How hard would it be to link a Vj to the Big-Screen and Turn-Out
all the Vehicles that show up into Back-Seat Party Mobiles.  The whole
place, even the fields that usually surround the places - would get set on
fire!!  Plus, add it to the Internet - for everyone that's interested, but
isn't able to go to that event.  If the Rave Scenes going Public - WE could
put party's everywhere.  Especially with the Help of the Internet and House
Party's.

That's what VJs do.

If you went to the recent party in the old theatre (the one that got  
busted)...  you'll know that we can cover some seriously large surfaces.

Subject: [sfraves] Tantra stage at pride?

Anyone seen a lineup and timeslots?  I've looked on both Pride's and  
Tantra's websites and found nothing except that they'll be in the  
usual place.  And I'm not sure where else to look.

I'll almost certainly wind up there regardless... they seem to be the  
only stage at pride that focuses more on having good DJs than gay  
DJs... but it'd be nice to be able to plan my day.


Thanks!
john

Ok, I've confirmed that this was last Saturday.  Warehouse party in SF was shut down and DJ equipment was either confiscated or  threatened with confiscation.  This was a free BYO party with no paid bar.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] more SF underground hassles?

Interesting. I dont think this is happening outside of SF... East and
north bay parties are being broken up with no confiscation... even
stuff being thrown on federal and military land (although we got quite
a scare from an assault rifle brandishing MP the other night... heh!).
Just 'go home, dont come back' status. This must be a SF specific
thing... does anyone know the promoters? Do they have any clue what
happened/why it was broken up?

Haha, I heard about that incident actually.  We partied out there the night
before with no probz whatsoever.  As for Saturday, wonder which party it
was.  I actually had friends asking to rent my CDJs and Rane Mixer for an
underground, now I'm totally glad I didn't!

Summary:
There was a party where cops showed up threatening to confiscate equipment
but decided pointing an AR15 at people was funnier.  >: D

But seriously, don't really know what happened in SF.  I do know my friends
had their last party at the Bassment (next to the smoking area in the back
alley of the Mezzanine) that went off without a hitch.

It was a warehouse party held in SF.  That's all I know at this time.  It was a non-commercial event with no one getting paid and no bar.  Apparently even the venue was donated.\

I'm trying to find out a bit more like what part of the city this was in, how the event was promoted, etc.

It would be interesting to construct a database of these events and see if that sheds any additional light on what is happening.  I'm thinking of setting up somethng on Google maps if anyone is interested...

Peter

Can we get any specifics on which parties were busted, under what circumstances, and the outcome?

For all those who missed it, the Tantra stage at pride was kickass. Liam Shy was fucking awesome and that stage made the whole hot day worth it. The other stages were just okay, but the Tantra stage seemed like the only one where everyone was really into it. It was my first time at the pride parade. Everyone should go.

I always enjoy Tantra's stages and floats.  Great music for parading too.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tantra Stage at Pride was great!

Tantra is always the best stage at Pride.  I've gotten to the point  
now where I barely even check out the rest of the stages and go  
straight to Tantra.  Not only is it by far the best music at pride,  
it's just a few minutes walk awat from a whole bevy of quickie-marts  
and liquor stores where you can get drinks for a quarter the price  
inside the festival!

I was glad to hear Denise is back to playing harder house instead of  
the more clubby stuff she's been playing recently.  That was kind of  
the highlight of Tantra for me.  I really missed her old style.

I did have to take off to see BoA at the main stage though.  Boo on  
the main stage people for making her start late and letting that '70s- 
reject-sounding act use up half of her timeslot  X-P

Good times overall though, and I'm sore as hell today.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] more SF underground hassles?

Love this discussion... love these ideas. PS whoever mentioned old
school promotion methods and xeroxed fliers -- that aesthetic is
amazing, and part of what makes raves special.. When I get a flier for
a party and its a photocopied piece of shit im way more likely to go.

There's a new generation of rave kids about to be 'born' right now,
and there's a lot of disenchantment with high gloss parties and a lot
of nostalgia for the past they never saw... Skills sees it (return of
the rave??). We should see it too.

Subject: [sfraves] Lindy in the Park shut down

--00504502c7ee90dccf046d977283
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I have a feeling I know which ranger shut this down.  I was really hoping
she'd be out of a job with all the budget cuts!
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/30/BAUI18EPS8.DTL

The authorities in Golden Gate park have cracked down on that scourge of the
city - Lindy dancing. For 13, years an informal group has gathered in the
park between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Dancing on JFK Drive, which is closed to
vehicle traffic on Sundays, they amuse the tourists, get a little exercise
and generally lift spirits. Lindy in the Park is such a hit that group
organizer Ken Watanabe says it attracts 100 to 200 dancers.

On Sunday, a park ranger told Watanabe that the dancers had 20 minutes to
break down their sound system and clear the area. It seems they didn't have
the correct music permit.

Watanabe says the group members have no problem getting a permit - they just
didn't know that they needed one. He says he never got a straight answer on
who thought Lindy hopping was a threat.

"It was very strange," he said.

Lisa Seitz-Gruwell, spokeswoman for the Recreation and Park Department,
offered some encouragement. "Lindy in the Park is a great event, and we want
to see it go forward. We are working with them to get permits in the
future."

MARCEL DETTMANN

Born on the 26th of October 1977 in P=F6ssneck (Th=FCringen).

Three hours ago he had caught the last train after a gig in Leipzig, headin=
g
for his set in Berlin the very same night. But Dettmann missed to get off =
=96
and suddenly has found himself stuck at dead end Hamburg main station: no
trains till morning, no one to call for a ride. Promptly =96 and without an=
y
hesitation about the ridiculous charge =96 he hires a cab, having only one
thing in mind: Berlin, Berghain, the Club=85

Consequently nothing but the Club as a musical and cultural lifeworld forms
and defines the life of Marcel Dettmann, who was born in the GDR in 1977 an=
d
raised with east-german youth culture. Influenced by EBM and Wave he faces
the offspring of virgin Techno in early nineties=92s Berlin and gets
socialized with this new-born subcultural scene, whose way of life he shall
live and develop until today. On the one hand, he has spun records since
1994 including residency continuum at Berlin=92s Ostgut/Berghain right from
its opening in 1999. On the other, Dettmann started to produce and release
tracks and remixes in 2006. Beside Ostgut Ton first and foremost his
self-run label MDR provides the necessary and appropriate outlet: no
compromise, free, independent, facilitating the =93quest for the optimal
track=94. His engagement at Berlin=92s Technosaur Hard Wax also supports hi=
s
innate quest: the continuous exploration of electronic music development.

Dettmann=92s persistent reply to inquiries on his DJ-style =96 no doubts ab=
out
its foundational and just natural club-oriented functionality =96 simply an=
d
sparsely reads =93dark=94 and =93the dark side=94. At a closer look this br=
ings to
light a certain fascination in Techno: a futuristic medium inherently
pointing towards the new and unseen, unexplored and unknown, undefined and
unexpected.

For Dettmann Techno depicts a determination of both his life and music. At
the same time it opens up the needed space to develop thoughts, actions and
creations. Eventually Dettmann is having only this space in mind: Berlin,
Berghain, the Club=85

Marcel Dettmann is one of the local residents of the Berlin club Berghain.

He also runs the label Marcel Dettman Records.

MARCEL FENGLER

The musical influences of Marcel Fengler present themselves double tracked.
His early teenager years are stamped by HipHop from crews like NWA, Gang
Starr and A Tribe called Quest, who have been his undisputed heroes. Even
today, Fengler spins some HipHop, but only in private.

His interest in electronic music on the other hand has been inspired by
continuous experiences in Berlin based techno clubs like E-Werk in the earl=
y
90s. The heavy, progressive synth- and acid sounds of this era still wield
some magical power on Fengler today.

"As the musical range today is vaster than ever, it is really important to
me in which context I=92m playing out my records. That=92s why I love
traditional labels like Planet E, Axis or Music Man and artists like Ron
Trent, Kenny Larkin and Robert Hood as much as I like contemporary artists
like Appleblim or DJ Qu."

Since the mid 90s, Marcel played at "Club im Park", a youth club in
F=FCrstenwalde, where he later launched a party series called "SC 93" toget=
her
with Marcel Dettmann. In 1997 he started to play at Berlin=92s Tresor among
other clubs and when Berghain openend in 2004, he became a resident on big
techno floor. In 2007 he released his first own record on Ostgut-Ton.

"It is important to me that music tells kind of a story using varied styles
from all eras. That=92s why I favour to build my sets up, then down again. =
It
has to be varied and it has to snake through the night in waves."

In 2007 Marcel has started to produce his own music as well. His tracks and
remixes are directly influenced by the heavy Techno sound of the Berghain.
His complex drum sounds and his generally rough sound design connect
seamlessly to his often more than five hour long DJ sets.

LENNY DE LA POSSO

Leonardo de la Posso has been involved in New York City's underground music
scene since 1991, first as a dancer at some of the hottest underground club=
s
in NYC at the time (Red Zone, Quicks, Soul Kitchen, Tunnel, Mars, Japans,
Engine Room, Sound Factory) By the mid nineties he had taken up the
incurable habit of Djing and amassing a library of vinyl to be proud of.
Lenny's name is on several of these releases as he has designed for a slew
of labels from around the world. He has also started several successful
weekly and bi-monthly parties (Composition, MILQ ~pre robots~, Rebel-also
one of the resident DJ's for the successful PHONO events), where he DJ's
alongside numerous respected international and local artists in the
electronic underground music scene. His motivation lies in the pursuit to
positively engage the audience with the most current and obscure sounds of
today, as well as yesterday. Never forget your past or you will never know
where to go in the future.

Currently he started a record label coming out of Brooklyn, NYC, called
Thema. The essence of Thema is to create a multi-artist platform to help
cultivate the scene here in NYC and and its presence in the underground
international circuit; to establish a label that focus' on the progression
of forward thinking electronic music with like minded individuals from
around the world.

That's why God gave us cell phone cams and YouTube.

Shame no one had the presence of mind to record that encounter and post it.

I've found that just pointing a cam in a belligerent person's direction gets
them to cool their jets real fast.

She tries to pull this shit again and 5 to 10 people are taping away and you
could have Pure Comedy Gold.
