Subject: [sfraves] Random Drug Tests For UK Clubbers While In Line

This is just so ridiculous in my eyes.  For one, it now establishes =20
guilty until proven innocent, whether or not you do drugs doesn't =20
matter.  There's also plenty of articles out there with reports of =20
people snorting cocaine in the Parliament, you don't see random tests =20=

there.

Random_Drug_Testing_For_Clubbers_While_In_Line

Clubbers hold hands up as drugs detected

By Kirsty Nicolson
DOZENS of clubbers were caught with traces of drugs on their hands =20
during a hi-tech swoop in the city on Friday night.
What do you think about the police testing clubbers for drugs? Add =20
your comments below or email our newsdesk: =20
eteditor@peterboroughtoday.co.uk.

A total of 240 revellers were tested during a police blitz of major =20
city bars and clubs during one night (March 24) =96 of which 36 were =20
found with traces of illegal substances, such as cocaine, ecstasy or =20
amphetamines on them.

The clubbers were then searched, but only two were arrested for =20
possession of drugs, while many admitted to taking the drugs earlier =20
in the evening.

Armed with a =A332,000 machine called the Ion Track Itemiser, police =20
swabbed the hands of pub and club-goers to see if they could detect =20
any street drugs.

Officers also swept the cardboard swab over toilet cisterns and seats =20=

=96 popular places for cutting and snorting lines of cocaine =96 and =20
found nine positive samples.

Six arrests were made in connection with drug or public order offences.

One person was arrested for possessing cannabis, and another for =20
methadone =96 a drug commonly used by people weaning themselves off =20
heroin.

Pc Tony Milsom led the initiative, codenamed Operation Barham, on =20
Friday night.

He was joined by local officers and staff from Lincolnshire Drug and =20
Alcohol Action team, who are experienced in using the machine.

Pc Milsom said: "This is the first time we have done this, and it =20
went really well.

"We will definitely be looking to do it again.

"We had an excellence response from the pubs and

clubs, and the majority of the public were pleased with what we were =20
doing.

"We will not tolerate drugs being used in our city."

Police swooped on establishments including The Solstice bar in =20
Northminster Road, the Cross Keys in Oundle Road and Liquid =20
nightclub, in New Road.

Staff at Liquid allowed officers to stand near the doors and test =20
people as they entered the club.

John Gallacher, from The Cross Keys, welcomed the move.

He said: "We have a zero tolerance approach towards drugs here.

"It worked really well and the customers were very happy with it."

Mr Gallacher said he puts Vaseline on the toilet cisterns every =20
weekend to deter people from snorting cocaine in the loos.

Deputy premises supervisor at the Solstice Kevin Jeffery said: "We =20
welcome anything that helps to prevent the use of drugs here, and we =20
are happy to support the police in what they are doing."

Yo Brandon,

I didn't have a lot of faith that we would be able to get in 15min before 
closing but we all wanted to get just a bit of bouncin' around out of our 
system before bed and we had all *meant* to be there hours and hours before 
(of course !)

Thanks for tryin' to get our slacker asses in at the last minute anyway :)

Thanks for all the interest guys!

A buddy of mine came down and picked it up today so I no longer have it.  
:-(


But im sure I will run across more gear in the future and can part with some 
more stuff down the line. I think I have a synth or two more laying around. 
Maybe a Juno 106 I *think* have to check the storage.

Yeah I didn't make it so Sunset as I had come down with some flu or virus.  

I thought at first it was after effects of my car accident bc I was aching especially in my neck and lower back, but then I spiked a nice low grade fever that eventually peaked at 103 before breaking Sunday AM.  Glad I didn't force myself to go and infect others...

Party reports puleez!

Peace,

Peter

Hmm.  

I always associated Tony H. with the funky chunky SF house sound, as represented on many of the records on Tango, Siesta, Red Melon, etc. that he produced, appears on, etc. or his remixes of H-Foundation... 

Now some of this stuff does drift into the Miami poolside sound, which is fine if you are in fact poolside in Miami otherwise it does tend to be a bit "tropical" for my taste.  

But hey hand me a good strong umbrella drink anywhere and I'll pretend.

Peter

Hey don't call me out as uncultured. :b

dangrsmind's kind of on point. I guess I just wasn't feeling that...
miami poolside vibe.

Maybe I should have brought more mixers/tiny umbrellas. Or some
heroin. A dollop of smack to the eyeball and I could have lain in that
grass listening until the sun went down.

You did hold out your pinky while dancing right?

I wasn't calling you out as uncultured...just explaining the vibe or lack thereof.

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles  
for your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap  
of empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."  - 
Fritz Williams

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone,  
but it worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

I didn't arrive at the party until around 5:15, and wasn't at the dancefloor
the whole time.  But the music I did hear, didn't sound like Miami Poolside
music.  I actually had been losing some faith in the state of house in SF,
but I heard a lot of great tunes this past weekend.

I don't know if this applies to you sean, but guessing from your 401K
statement, I'd guess you were among the younger people at the party (aside
from all the kids that were dragged out by their graver parents).  From what
I've noticed, the younger kids, or one's who party with the all age /18+
rave crowd have been brought up on mostly peak hour, filtered disco and
funky house, and the last couple of years, funky electro house-  stuff like
Steve Angello, Subliminal Records, Bryan Cox???   When you compare this
stuff to the music at Sunset, it probably does make it sound like loungey
poolside music!
Don't write off Sunset just yet... give it at least one more chance!  You
might learn a thing or two from your elders as well  ;)

DAPAYK

Over the course of time, Niklas Worgt has used his share of project names,
the most well known of which would have to be Dapayk. Since 1993, Niklas ha=
s
crafted his own tracks. Cuts with drum&bass and breakbeat sport the same
difference as pumpin' techno and techhouse. As the drum&bass live act
"Frauds in White" he started to make a name for himself on the barely
developed breakbeat scene of middle Germany in the mid-90's. As "Sonstware"
he held residence at parties and stepped into the late 90's as Dapayk. Ther=
e
were a few years, however, between then and 2001 when he released his first
record. From that release, Dapayk was basically taken as the cornerstone
alias for his various projects on his label, Mo's Ferry Productions.

In cooperation with German topmodel Eva Padberg there came the project
Dapayk&Padberg. After the first single was released in 2005, a first album
was released, reaching the years Top 10 charts in respected German magazine=
s
Groove, De-bug, and Raveline, as well as bringing Niklas a Top 10 spot in
the producer charts. His sound can be characterized as "prickling" displays
of the art of balancing electronics music's Minimal, Electronica and
Breakbeat forms.  Together with his school mate Jan Langhammer he founded
Mo's Ferry daughter labels "Fenou" and "Rrygular" as the playground for
electronica and minimal techno respectively. In addition to his work as
Dapayk, since the beginning of 2006 Niklas has released techno tracks as
"Marek Bois" on Trapez and Rrygular.

In 2006 Dapayk's first solo album was released. He entered again the top 10
of the poll charts of German techno magazine Groove as best producer, best
live act and with the album itself.  Dapayk has released on labels such as
Karloff, Textone, Orac, Contexterrior, Trapez, Resopal, Friends of Tomorrow=
,
Mo's Ferry Prod., Fenou and Rrygular.

JUSTIN MAXWELL

Justin Maxwell invented music with one hand, and he can destroy it with the
other.  A frequent collaborator with Miss Teen USA (1996, 1998), John
Tejada, and 1/2 of the electro duo Volsoc, professional sound designer for
popular synths and software, and even once producing a remix for Georgio
Moroder, he's released a pantload of gritty, weird bleepy crap over the pas=
t
few years and has gained about 10 pounds since moving to San Francisco.
Favoring synthesizer accidents and ugly sounds, his releases receive
intimate aural cuddling by Anja Schneider, Laurent Garnier, Steve Bug, Mike
Shannon, Andrea Parker, and a good amount of praise from the UK and French
writers.   Also, he recently grew a beard.

Congrats on that BTW Andrew.

OUCH on graver parent...

i guess i fall under that category?

32 isn't a bad age in my opinion..anywho...

as to the children running around..my kids had fun...my 7 year old enjoyed dancing, while my 13 yr old took snap shots at all the  "HOT GIRLS" as he stated..

oh oh and then he freaked out because i was wearing a halter top...geesh

is it time to retire my myself from the scene???

but I heard a lot of great tunes this past weekend.

I don't know if this applies to you sean, but guessing from your 401K
statement, I'd guess you were among the younger people at the party (aside
from all the kids that were dragged out by their graver parents).  From what
I've noticed, the younger kids, or one's who party with the all age /18+
rave crowd have been brought up on mostly peak hour, filtered disco and
funky house, and the last couple of years, funky electro house-  stuff like
Steve Angello, Subliminal Records, Bryan Cox???   When you compare this
stuff to the music at Sunset, it probably does make it sound like loungey
poolside music!
Don't write off Sunset just yet... give it at least one more chance!  You
might learn a thing or two from your elders as well  ;)

Subject: [sfraves] Opel "V" Party Midnight Ceremony (Political)

All,

This (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPy27c0GEc) is a link to video shown at the Opel/Opulent Temple five year "V" party at midnight for your review and comment.

I don't know how I feel about some of these images being shown to someone that might not be expecting it at a party, but I largely agree with Syd's message here.  I especially thought his advice about how to get started making a change in the world starting with yourself was dead on so I'm passing the link on to you.  I wasn't at the party so I am not sure how it went over there.

I do think this level of political communication is vital to keeping the "rave scene" alive, vital, and meaningful.  Its a party with a purpose after all.  A tip o' the hat to Syd and Opel for taking the chance to say something important in the context of a party again.  Especially after looking at that video that old "good news" rave story posted by Apollo yesterday, this idea seems more important than ever to me today.

I don't think Syd or anyone from Opel is present on the list, and I'm not one of the creators of this video, so while I know you will all feel free to comment on the politicas aspect I won't defend the specific beliefs presented in the video.  Don't shoot the messenger! 

Peace,

Peter

Don't be so sure.  Remember what happened to Ed Rosenthal.

If some pig decides it wants to make an example of you, then its word  
IS the law, and they will happily throw away "probable cause", the  
"will of the voters" and the... well... the actual LAW in order to  
make you suffer.  That Rosenthal was eventually vindicated in the  
courtroom doesn't change all the harassment and expense he suffered  
beforehand.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: The Most Interesting Documentary I've Seen In a Long Time

Things I learned:

In the 1970s, after 30 years of global cooling, there was the same  
kind of doomsday panic about a "freezing earth" as we see today with  
global warming.

The co-founder of Greenpeace left after he saw it transformed in to a  
group that was more about promoting anti-corporate and anti-industry  
socialist ideas, versus actually trying to create a healthier earth.

It's a BBC show, and as usual is very well done-
(don't let the title make you think it's some sort of nutjob 9/11  
conspiracy thing)

In short- The "science" behind CO2 causing global warming isn't  
science at all, and if you think that "Intelligent Design" is a crock  
of shit, then you *really* need to see this, and see how you're being  
fed bucketfuls of crap about global warming too :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: The Most Interesting Documentary I've Seen In a Long Time

Have you ever seen any BBC programming?

Whatever- If being exposed to ideas that may conflict with what you  
think you know, scares you- then by all means continue to put your  
head in the sand when they arise.

I on the other hand prefer to hear all sides and opinions on a  
matter, and come to my own conclusion.  If you can take an hour out  
of your life to actually watch it, maybe you can do the same.
The more you know :)

And since you directly asked, no, I personally don't think we are  
headed towards any catastrophic global climate change event due to  
manmade CO2 emission.
I've held that position for a while, and shared this documentary  
because it illustrates things far better than I ever can- and it  
contained some things I was not aware of.

there's some legitimacy to questioning popularly-held beliefs.   
science has been wrong before.
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15391426/site/newsweek/

regardless of this global warming/cooling business, i do know that  
all this driving and burning of long-buried hydrocarbons isn't good  
for us. open your car window on a freeway during rush hour traffic  
and you'll understand - no scientific study needed.

so, do what's right for our atmosphere (and our own lungs) and quit  
waiting for scientific evidence to tell you what you should do.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: The Most Interesting Documentary I've Seen In a Long Time

Ok, well..  Let's take the (admittedly huge for me) mental step of saying "Global Warming is a natural thing and has nothing to do with human's actions".  (despite the fact that there is no historical record, nor any even half-credible left-field interpolation of past trends that signals any of the kinds of changes we're seeing now)

Would you not agree that we as a society of man are not treating our home very well anyhow?  Rampant overpopulation, clearcutting forests, poisoning the oceans, air pollution, industrial wastes spewed everywhere, many locales in crisis over lack of fresh water due to contamination, few people (and even fewer governments) taking any kind of responsibility for the health and well-being of humans and other animals, etc etc...

Shit is fucked, in a major way, global warming or no global warming.  Shit may be irreparably fucked, at least in our lifetimes (however short they may be for many).  

Is there any harm, then, in having a central cause to rally behind in the name of healing the earth?  Hell, the only reason people are finally catching on to fuel efficient cars, sustainable goods, organic/local food, alternative transit, etc is because they finally are being shown something tangible that we may have done by our previous actions.

In the 80s, one of the big scares was the plight of endangered species.  There were probably people sitting around saying "There's plenty of goddamn giant pandas and spotted owls- i dun seen a panda on TV!" then, too.  However, the public was made aware of what was happening and a lot of good work went into saving these species.  Many of them are doing far better today because of it.  There are certainly more pointless things for us to put energy into- like needless wars, for example.

To my mind, there's no reason NOT to work to save our fuckin' skins, and the skins of those we live alongside.  Really, is it so tantalizing to prick a hole in the current enthusiasm for the environment that it's worth possibly derailing some people who would have contributed?  These people reek of the same kind of smug self-satisfaction shared by holocaust doubters.  

Seems like a no-brainer to me.  Good work is good work.  Survival is job one.

Things I learned:

In the 1970s, after 30 years of global cooling, there was the same  
kind of doomsday panic about a "freezing earth" as we see today with  
global warming.

The co-founder of Greenpeace left after he saw it transformed in to a  
group that was more about promoting anti-corporate and anti-industry  
socialist ideas, versus actually trying to create a healthier earth.

It's a BBC show, and as usual is very well done-
(don't let the title make you think it's some sort of nutjob 9/11  
conspiracy thing)

In short- The "science" behind CO2 causing global warming isn't  
science at all, and if you think that "Intelligent Design" is a crock  
of shit, then you *really* need to see this, and see how you're being  
fed bucketfuls of crap about global warming too :)

Too bad I've personally been ripped off by inhouse ticketing (now

I've come up with some good rebuttles to people that promote global warming
propaganda. I would like Gore to be asked for answers to these questions:

1. What about the previous Earth ice ages? Can you definitievely say that
global warming and cooling isn't a natural part of the Earth's cycle?

2. What about Mars and how it has been getting hotter? Obviously the global
warming of Mars has nothing to do with humans.

3. C02 causes warming? There is zero indicators that C02 levels have ever
affected climate. C02 levels follow climate change, not create it. And even
if it did, 1 volcanic erruption would send more C02 into the atmosphere then
all human activity combined.

If anything can be learned from hurrican Katrina it is that we humans have
less effect on our environment then we think. If we combined every engine
and power source that humans have ever created and came up with a giant fan
it would slow a hurricane by less then 1 mph. People like Gore are arrogant
to think we humans are so powerful. Even space wise, all the humans on Earth
could fit into California.

And lets just say I'm wrong, lets just say that human industry from the
industrial revolution is destroying the Earth. Wouldn't it be worth it? The
amount of people living and the quality of life has increased due to the
industrial revolution. I guess I just love life and humans.

BTW - Doesn't Gore fly on a private jet?

oh come on. you say that as if conservatives don't want you to be  
scared.  it's not that simple.

unfortunately, the unwritten rules of politics are such that you have  
to scare people to have them listen/believe/follow you.  see: war on  
terror; immigrants stealing our jobs; negro marijuana fiends raping  
white women; etc. etc ad nauseum


Al Gore is a politician.  while i applaud his efforts to get people  
to take accountability for their actions and how they effect our  
planet, i don't agree with the fear tactics... but as i said, that's  
the only way to get people to listen to you in this country.

well it's been long known that volcanic emissions and other geological
activity far outweighs the contributions of manmade CO2 and sulfur gas and
other "greenhouse gases," to the point that a single massive volcanic
eruption (something on the scale of Mt Vesuvius or Mt St Helens) releases
more greenhouse gases than have been produced by man in all of history
summed up.  Polution is harmful to us in many other ways, and destructive to
health and the environment in many ways, but climatology is one of the
smallest concerns about polution.  Our contribution is a drop in the bucket.

What's much more important than pointing fingers at industry is having a way
to deal with things in the event that global warming, as a natural
phenomenon, continues to the point that it becomes a real danger, I would
imagine mostly via impact on agriculture.  We really cannot do anything to
control natural change, and the last I heard, climatologists were split
around 60/40 prevailing against the notion of problematic global warming.
Preparedness is good, but changing our lives out of fear for something we
can't control is bad.

It's not about derailing any enthusiasm for the environment, it's  
about a single issue- that being that manmade CO2 emission is the  
cause for global warming, that's all.

And yes, it is harmful to have a central cause to rally behind if  
that cause is not really a cause at all.

Watch the video :)

Cuz you can believe everything you see on TV, lol.

There is scientific proof of problems due to IRREGULAR climate change ALL O=

=20
I am fully aware that there are lots of things that happen that people used=
 to think were going to be the end of the world (polar reversal for example=
 - it happens, and it doesn't destroy us), however, the RATE at which the c=
limate is changing, and the ripple effects that happen as a result are caus=

 maybe not even in a decade - but a HELLUVA lot faster then they would have=
 if we weren't spewing fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere in insane =
quantities.=20

So, you can "bury your head in the sand" all YOU want, but the generations =
to come (if not our own) might wanna spit on the graves of folks like yours=
elf for being too selfish and stubborn to see the big picture.
=20
FYI - I am NOT a bleeding heart liberal, nor an "activist", nor a hippy fuc=
kwit, or any of that shit. I am typically the 1st person to challenge overl=
y panicky do-gooder types - but when I myself have seen insane climate shif=
ts all over the country, that simply were NOT happening 2 decades ago, not =
to mention species dying out en masse (faster than typical extinction rates=
), I tend to believe what the vast majority of scientists in the WORLD say.
=20
BBC reporting it or not....that's like saying "Fox News reported it - they'=
ll never lie!", and we all know how ridiculous that would be to say. Right?=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: global fucking warming

i do think that the massive amount of carbon fuels being burnt is 
contributing in *some way* to the ecology only because it is a closed system 
and it simply cannot *NOT* affect it.  weather that is a stoutly negative 
affect is obviously up for debate -yes, pun always intended (tm)

however, there certainly is no "fact" that there have been no historical 
evidence to show what is happening now is unique.  there couln't be.  the 
technology that enables such grand monitoring of the minute facets of the 
global weather systems had not existed until only recently, thus an argument 
on this basis is without basis to say the least.

there are a few facts that seem to escape most people's "history".  for 
instance the air quality in the bay area... there is documented existance of 
massive "smog" due to the rampant burning of wood for heat and clearing of 
land.  i remember vividly one history book we saw in an excursion during 
middle school that contained a scan of a hand-drawn image showing a 
rendition of the san jose valley with the smog hanging in stratus over the 
area.  there weren't any cameras back then so this is the best documentation 
we have i suppose.

where there climatal changes due specifically to the massive wood burning at 
the time?  where there climatal changes previously to that for *any* reason? 
do we understand the "ice age" as it has been studied and what caused it if 
it existed?  do we know any gawd damn thing whatsoever ?

we do know one thing...  energy is finite.  that *fact* said, it is only 
reasonable to assume that we would be better off if energy consumption were 
minimized as much as reasonably possible and alternative solutions for more 
efficient energy use found and exploited.

although i don't shit in my neighbor's yard, i'm wth philip on this one and 
likewise do my part to minimize energy consumption when i can, such as 
recycling, carpooling with 3 people across the bridge each day, building my 
home media server with energy-conserving parts so that it expels 173WHr 
instead of the 340WHr as it did before, etc..   however, I still willfully 
expending extraneous energy in some places only for my own selfish want, 
such as motorsports racing, leaving my electrostatic speakers plugged in and 
consuming 23WHr of energy 24Hrs a day, keeping ~80 bottles of wine chilled 
at any givven time in a dual-zone wine chiller, typing this to you on my 
large glowing calculator, etc.

i agree that enthusiasm for conserving energy is good but i take issue with 
the near fanatisizm levels that some of these "enthusiasts" take things, 
some of which i view as systematically removing my freedom -my freedom to 
conserve energy as I see fit.  if enough people out there show enough 
blatant disregard for the "resonable" efforts of the rest of the society to 
conserve, then government should of course be enlisted to apply modest 
regulation to assure a modicom of compliance.  in a capitalist economic 
society, i expect this government regulation to lie squarely against the 
capitalistic inertia that cannot be blamed for its explotation of available 
resources to survive.  aside from that, leave it at reasonable efforts.

for a change i'd like to see people focusing their energy on doing what they 
can to conserve and to stop expelling their rageful energy by pointing the 
sneer finger at others.

let he without energy consumption torch the first car !

stfu - kthx

In regards to your Global Warming promoting anti-corporate and anti-industry
socialist ideas....  I would suggest you do some research on the Global
Economic Forum held at Davos this year.  Issue no. 2 at the forum in 2007,
GLOBAL WARMING, the no. 1 issue was sustaining current profit levels (these
are business people after all).  The numbers of corporations and CEO's who
recognize climate change is growing every year-  and with the economic
report done by all star economist Sir Nicholas Stern spells for a dreadful
economy in the future if many of the predictions scientists have forecasted
have become true.  I will check out the video when I get home- but to
characterize the global warming issue as socialist propaganda is blatantly
false

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: The Most Interesting Documentary I've Seen In a Long Time

I think you need to put global warning in quotes rather than all caps. 
you're drawing a cause-effect where none exists.

The most highly successful businesses do not bury their head in the sand if 
their economic support system is being impacted by purchase and regulatory 
trends centering around a common thread.  What do you think is the number 1 
topic when the big tobacco companies get around the campfire ?  i'd expect 
it would be "Lung Cancer" but i doubt their action item list includes 
"finding a cure".

FYI you can watch the WEF live via the Always On Network: http:// 
www.alwayson.goingon.com/
(my former company handled the live streaming)

And I didn't mean to characterize the entire movement as socialist  
propaganda at all, I just found it interesting that the co-founder of  
Greenpeace saw his own group infiltrated by these types- and well,  
looking at most of the protests I see these days, they do seem to me  
to be less about actually changing anything and more about trying to  
get some patchouli-scented pussy :P

This is like trying to rewind time-
Philosophically fanciful, but fruitless in execution.

If you're so content to rest upon the laurels of your religious =20
fervor, would you like to put your money where your mouth is?
A friendly wager? 10kUSD each in an interest bearing account?

Or maybe you'd like to actually watch the video before committing =20
yourself to such a position?

Dave, you may be surprised to find that many of the people at Davos appear
not only to have a genuine concern about global warming, but are also takin=
g
steps to address the issue in an enlightened manner.

Taken from a businesweek.com article at the WEF at Davos this year:

A diligent student could practically earn a graduate degree in Global
Warming Studies just by coming to Davos this year. Some of the session
topics: Energy Strategy as a Competitive Advantage. Designing Sustainable
Cities. The Legal Landscape Around Climate Change. The Green Rush (that's
about the business viability of green investments). Addressing Global Fault
Lines (ecological risk is a big part of this). The Security Implications of
Climate Change. Climate Change: A Call to Action. And this
plaintive-sounding one: Sustainable Energy Consumption:

Oh I wouldnt' be surprised at all.  However, in the context that you poised 
about how to retain existing profitablitiy, existing corporations who's core 
business is not "green" exploitation, would of course be doing all they can 
to making their customers happy.  if you're a tobacco company and the United 
Lung Association launches a smeer campain to show smoking is hazardous to 
your health, smart tobacco companies rallied and introduced "low tar" 
cigarettes as to remain profitable.

On the offensive side, now that people are more willing to spend hard-earned 
$$$ on "green" solutions, a weath of opportunities arise where they were 
previously not economically feasible.

nope, it all makes perfect sense.  no surprises here except how the public 
was scared into acting on an issue that is in general, pretty good for them. 
my theory is people are so fucking pistol whipped stemming from a continued 
glacier-like grinding of threat into them since the attack on the World 
Trade Center in NY.  usually the powers that be don't see fit to herd the 
cats toward something good for them, but something bad, such as the war in 
iraq.

Dave, you may be surprised to find that many of the people at Davos appear
not only to have a genuine concern about global warming, but are also taking
steps to address the issue in an enlightened manner.

Taken from a businesweek.com article at the WEF at Davos this year:

A diligent student could practically earn a graduate degree in Global
Warming Studies just by coming to Davos this year. Some of the session
topics: Energy Strategy as a Competitive Advantage. Designing Sustainable
Cities. The Legal Landscape Around Climate Change. The Green Rush (that's
about the business viability of green investments). Addressing Global Fault
Lines (ecological risk is a big part of this). The Security Implications of
Climate Change. Climate Change: A Call to Action. And this
plaintive-sounding one: Sustainable Energy Consumption:

I haven't been to a such a megasized  rave-like artsy-fartsy geek fest multi-media experience and schmooze event thingee for a freakin long time!  Flashbacks to 1994.

Anyone know if Beverly Reiser is one of the organizers?  I know her from way back when...

Wow I actually am sort of ewxcited about this location and party.  This hangar is a cool place, I was in there once during a job interview!  Not sure my wife would be up to going tho as she is 8 months pregnant.  Hmm.  Hmm. Hmm.

Um...religious fervor? Again, I'm no activist. I don't go around bitching to

To echo George's sentimnets though - is it really a BAD thing to try and get 
people to cause less harmful waste/emissions/etc.? Is it a bad thing to try 
and help clean up our world so we dont have a cesspool to grow old in, or

I think people can go overboard on the issue from BOTH sides - but to act as 
if it's just not happening is patently absurd.

I never really worried that hard about shit until a friend of mine who's 
doing ice core studies (globally) gave me the lowdown on how radically 
different (and bad) things have become in the last 200 years in comparison 
to BILLIONS of years prior.

Elegantly put Brian:)

Personally I don't understand all the energy focused on "who caused"  
global warming:  people;  mama nature;  aliens or whatever.  The  
climate is changing and there will be at least great discomfort and  
more likely the gnashing of the few remaining teeth ahead.  Prudent  
rational beings would be doing everything possible to lessen  
magnitude of change.

Scared.  Who's scared?  I look out my window on Ocean Beach and see  
bigger and bigger SUVs, trucks and even "art" buses parked outside.   
Freighters and tankers churn in and out of the bay every day bringing  
cheap goods made in polluting sweat shops in the East, oil to feed  
our cowboy culture, and mechanical horses to assure the validation of  
individuality.  On and on.

We live in a culture of denial and instant gratification.  Next  
month's bottom line rules in business.  I see lots of money being  
made on green movies, t-shirts and feel-good petition sites but  
nothing of substance happening to ignite real economic, cultural and  
political change.  No one wants to  
be....uncomfortable....inconvenienced.  Scared?:)

It takes near Armageddon to move human ass.

We humans have been here a very short time.  And I think we will be a  
drop in the piss pot of time species.  Good I say.  Time the earth  
was cleansed and this short dirty human experiment put to rest.   
Guard those perceptual defenses.  Keep up the destructive work:)  We  
don't need predators to keep us in check.  We do the job much too  
well ourselves.

Human extinction is grate!!!!

By heavens I seem to be becoming a misanthrope.

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: global fucking warming


Appollo touches on the very heart of the issue...  Arrogance.

Humans are by default arrogant.  They either stand around saying "LOOK WHAT 
WE DID!!!" or they're worried about "WHAT WE ARE DOING".

How arrogant to think that we are so strong as to destory something that's 
been around for millions of years.  To think we are so powerful as to 
change and de-terreform (ATHF!!!) a planet.  Gimme a break.  Better yet, so 
arrogant as to think we'll change something that is naturally 
occuring.  Every try to move a stream?

Is global warming naturally occuring?  Geological core samples says 
yes.  The planet gets hot, it get's cold.  This is nothing really new.  It 
happens over hundreds of years, but there has been global climate change 
happening all on it's own.

Does all teh pollution and utter shit we globally dump help this 
along?  Sure.  It's a contributing factor.  Peopel have been burning wood 
since that dawn of man, and only NOW is it an issue?  Forests burn 
naturally as part of the growth process.  For argument i cite the various 
pine cones that only open when put to forest fire tempetures.  It's how new 
trees are created.  The old dies and the new grows.  Such is life.  To say 
that burning wood is destroying everything is a farce.

Now are we burning clean wood or chemically treated wood?  Well, that's 
another issue entirely.  That's been one of my gripes with the whole BRC 
thing every summer.  Claim to be enviormental while burning tons of wood, 
paint, metal, pressure treated woods and EL wire for the sake of a great 
party.  Kinda hypocritical.  *shurg*

Will the toxic waste in the oceans kill off everything?  Doubtful.  the 
ocean is big.  Will nature adapt?  Oh ya.  No doubt about it.  Things like 
lead and mercury came from the ground in teh first place, and they'll 
eventually return.  Other things will break down over time.  Our time?  Oh 
hell no.  In earth time, sure.  What's 1000 years to a planet?

The topic of overpopulation, to me, is the most comical of all.  Here's why:

You can find sites for the groups that are pledgeing to help teh earth by 
non reproducing.  Now, these are fairly intellegent, educated people who 
want to do their part.  Good for them!  Unfortunatly, there's PLENTY of 
uneducated poverty striken people, not just in the U.S., but globally, who 
will have no problem at all making up for these peoples lack of genertic 
dispersion.  No money for food but they're breeding and there's 10 kids for 
every woman of age.  Explain this one...  maybe instead of Food Not bombs 
we need "Condoms not Dipers" or some other organization spreading the news 
of the wonder of the 20th century known as The Condom.

Ok...   rant off...  flame on...

It's all the indoor pot growers that are creating the greenhouse effect 
with their CO2 drip systems.

The outdoor growers are TOTALLY down with more CO2.  I mean, harvest never 
looked so good!

Appollo touches on the very heart of the issue...  Arrogance.

Humans are by default arrogant.  They either stand around saying "LOOK WHAT
WE DID!!!" or they're worried about "WHAT WE ARE DOING".

How arrogant to think that we are so strong as to destory something that's
been around for millions of years.  To think we are so powerful as to
change and de-terreform (ATHF!!!) a planet.  Gimme a break.  Better yet, so
arrogant as to think we'll change something that is naturally
occuring.  Every try to move a stream?

Is global warming naturally occuring?  Geological core samples says
yes.  The planet gets hot, it get's cold.  This is nothing really new.  It
happens over hundreds of years, but there has been global climate change
happening all on it's own.

Does all teh pollution and utter shit we globally dump help this
along?  Sure.  It's a contributing factor.  Peopel have been burning wood
since that dawn of man, and only NOW is it an issue?  Forests burn
naturally as part of the growth process.  For argument i cite the various
pine cones that only open when put to forest fire tempetures.  It's how new
trees are created.  The old dies and the new grows.  Such is life.  To say
that burning wood is destroying everything is a farce.

Now are we burning clean wood or chemically treated wood?  Well, that's
another issue entirely.  That's been one of my gripes with the whole BRC
thing every summer.  Claim to be enviormental while burning tons of wood,
paint, metal, pressure treated woods and EL wire for the sake of a great
party.  Kinda hypocritical.  *shurg*

Will the toxic waste in the oceans kill off everything?  Doubtful.  the
ocean is big.  Will nature adapt?  Oh ya.  No doubt about it.  Things like
lead and mercury came from the ground in teh first place, and they'll
eventually return.  Other things will break down over time.  Our time?  Oh
hell no.  In earth time, sure.  What's 1000 years to a planet?

The topic of overpopulation, to me, is the most comical of all.  Here's why:

You can find sites for the groups that are pledgeing to help teh earth by
non reproducing.  Now, these are fairly intellegent, educated people who
want to do their part.  Good for them!  Unfortunatly, there's PLENTY of
uneducated poverty striken people, not just in the U.S., but globally, who
will have no problem at all making up for these peoples lack of genertic
dispersion.  No money for food but they're breeding and there's 10 kids for
every woman of age.  Explain this one...  maybe instead of Food Not bombs
we need "Condoms not Dipers" or some other organization spreading the news
of the wonder of the 20th century known as The Condom.

Ok...   rant off...  flame on...

Such is the wonder of the Bay Area, where I can be so vehemently

Through discussion, comes truth :)

Here's my substance.  A pledge of no sex with anyone who drives an SUV. 
I encourage others to join in.  Flipping off hummer drivers isn't

This is something that was pointed out to me just last night.  It's 
likely the "ignant" folk of the world will be where the bulk of our

side effect of the "no sex with suv drivers" campaign in eliminating 
that gene strain probably won't take place.)

Wasn't there a city (or state) program targeting low income people to 
pay them to get sterilized?

I haven't had time to complete my 2 cents on this global warming =20
topic, the problem is it's become 2 dollars now and I want to pare it =20
down.  But I thought since someone brought up overpopulation I'd point =20
out that some of the most hardcore globalists are obsessed with =20
overpopulation and eugenics.  Yes, eugenics.  And this guy is one of =20
them, he advocated releasing the ebola virus to control the =20
population.  Or maybe we could do what Henry Kissinger wrote in the =20
1970's to President Nixon in a report saying we need to reduce the =20
world's population by 80%.  By the way, does anyone know how China =20
enforces the one child policy?  Yea let's have this here too.  Next =20
time you're out dancing, think good thoughts for people less fortunate =20
than you, please.  Thanks.  Delta Quadrant out.

But dude. We're western descendants of christians. I think instead we
should replace their gods, make them adopt agriculture, and tell them
it's a sin to not reproduce like mad. :)

Best idea ever.

Do you know what I hate?  Guys who don't feel manly enough and try to
compensate by buying a big giant truck.

Dude, if you want to feel manly, go fucking work out at the gym.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: global fucking warming

For me the most interesting aspect of the global warming debate is that for the most part none of us have any actual experience or informaiton which can inform the debate.  

That is, unless you are a scientist studying climate change you probably are just repeating what someone else has told you about the subject.  Now before you all get up in arms please realize this applies to both sides of the discussion.  The primary issue seems to be which movie you decide to believe in.  And IMO blind belief is always dangerous no matter which side of an issue it leads you to choose.

Can you construct a repeatable experiment which will determine whether human CO2 emissions are causing global warming or not?  If no such experiment can one be constructed, this is no longer a scientific question but instead is a matter of religious belief.

Peace,

Peter

Do you know what I hate?
People who generalize, and the Dutch.

Hold on to your trousers, because not only do I own 3 big trucks, my  
mom owns an SUV that is rarely used to haul people or goods!
(sorry JC, guess that means no sex for you, though the only reason  
she owns it is because her legs don't really work anymore so she  
needed a vehicle with a high step-in height- maybe you can make an  
exception?)

And well- chop my balls off!  One of my trucks is excessively large,  
heavy, and gets only 6mpg!
http://www.flickr.com/photos/scosol/362930718/

Does driving it make me feel more manly?
Yes in fact, it does.
Just like camping, and building things, and fighting with my dog-
You see- some men, even in this bubble of the bay area we call home,  
recognize the instincts that are still within them-
And they are unwilling to succumb to society's desire to turn them in  
to the other pussies they see around them-
So they do things like that, to keep that raw side sharp-
Be it building a shelter, a campfire, or shooting things, or enjoying  
driving a 50yo military vehicle- in all it's noisy, vibrating, over- 
engineered glory.

Considering how much that particular vehicle has served the common good - I 
don't mind it.

But a single individual who drives gas guzzling trucks "just cuz"...is plain 
retarded.

Do you do construction or own your own landscaping business that would 
require such forms of transportation on a REGULAR basis, or do you just have 
a truck "because".

Sounds like a your momma joke should be added here, so I guess I'll 
simply point here:

(no disrespect toward YOUR mother though.)

Well, I'd consider that a lot more pussy than, for instance the dude 
riding in the aids ride all the way down to LA that Danny posted about. 
But that's MY opinion, as it doesn't take a whole lot of effort (or 
skill) to push down with your foot atop an accelerator pedal.

Camping doesn't require a 6Mpg vehicle.  (One can even reach the 
Pinnacles Natl' Forest in a day via bicycle, which I've done myslelf. 
No shooting involved on that trip however.)

Amen to that.

That's why I love discussions.  The true sign of intellegence is being able 
to violently discuss topics without outright hating somebody.  ;)

Even better when you argue something you may not believe in (debate) for 
the sake of philisophical exploration.

The battle cry of the liberal...   "I disagree with you so you're ignorant!"

As usual, missing the point.  Will the planet go on?  Yes.  Will life go 
on?  Yes.  Will that life allow humans to life?  Probably not.

And really, that's what most mainstream conservation is about.  Making sure 
that human life will continue on.  We don't care about teh life of teh 
rainforest, we care that teh cure for cancer COULD be in that forest and it 
needs to be saved.

Also, where did you get your 99.999999% statistic?  References please.

Not at all.  Oh it'll get sick, it'll get angry, and it WILL retaliate, and 
it WILL get better.  It may take 20,000 years, but it will live on.

Humans on the other hand...      that was the point I was making.

For all we know, GW is natural, the caps will melt, earth will flood 
(wouldn't be the first time) then a new ice age (again, wouldn't be the 
first time), and everything resets, re-evolves, and life will go on.

Everyone yelling about CO2...   ever consider that plants thrive on 
it?  It's also a perservative.  It will stop corrosion.  Ever consider an 
atmosphere that was primarily CO2 in which Oxygen (a corrosive) is the 
toxic pollutant.  What would live and thrive in this?  Ever consider that 
an Oxygen rich enviorment IS the sick planet, and it's going back to a CO2 
based ecosystem?

Wouldn't be too hospitable for humans and mamals would it.

Believe me, I hate dead reefs, and the rest of the enviormental 
issues.  Really chaps my ass to the point of violence.  What'ya gonna do 
though? How are you going to tell China to stop using CFC's?

Maybe we should go to war...!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: global fucking warming

Well this is probably true about which movie one believes in unless  
they've read a few books on the subject and hopefully a few  
university studies.

My belief that global warming is an inside job ... oh sorry, that's  
9/11 ... anyway, my belief that global warming is hype comes from  
listening to both Alex Jones and Michael Savage express their views  
on the subject, Paul Watson (prisonplanet.com)  articles citing links  
to NASA showing global warming on Pluto, Jupiter and Mercury, and  
comparing this to years ago when my good friends I had before the  
rave days tried to convince me this stuff goes in cycles.  Also  
there's a few articles I've posted to my forwarding list that are  
good to read if you're not basically familiar with the non-man made  
global warming theory platform.  I should read more books on it, well  
I should read more books period, but I have a lot of things that jump  
around in this brain, not to mention procrastination galore.

Really the only thing that would affect me personally is if the  
oceans happened to rise and flood me out of a home I lived at sea  
level, which I highly doubt is going to happen because there are  
different theories on what would actually happen if all the ice caps  
in the world melted tomorrow.  by the way, were you all aware they're  
not all melting but in some areas we're actually gaining ice fields?   
Well the globalists probably don't want you to know that because they  
want their stupid global tax on CO2 tailpipe emissions, as if this  
were going to fix the problem.

Is there really even a problem?  Quite frankly, I'm not really so  
sure anymore.

Also the one book I read which isn't related to global warming  
directly, but it does talk about sunspot cycles is The Mayan  
Prophecies.  And correct me if I'm wrong but we are going through a  
really hot sun cycle right now and it's expected to brighten even  
more by 2012.

That stance I can at least semi-understand. Sorta.

Who knows if us human-folk haven't already fucked things for ourselves 
beyond belief. I guess we'll find out the hard way if people (in general 
globally) don't make some sort of effort(s) to combat the situation.

Any party where you burn a fuck ton of stuff and spew hippy filth all over 
the place is not environmentally friendly.

Might be fun, but it is by no means environmentally friendly.

Unfortunately, it's been my experience that rave circles have a higher 
proportion of Libertarians amongst them than the overall populace.  As 
such, you get scewed opinions (and the same can be said of the 
proportion of those with progressive views.)

An aside.  I've heard that only 50% of people ever pick up and read a

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: global fucking warming


Ya, see, that's what I was getting at, in a not so direct matter.  I wasn't 
talking so much about teh planet itself, more so of the generalization of 
humanity.  In our lifetime there may be ONE minor slight evolutional change 
in a species (avg mammal).  In planet time you would look at hundreds of 
these as something to note, not a single one, so our lifetimes are a mere 
blip on the radar of time.

As in HHGTTG:  Mostly Harmless.

Thus, getting back to my original point, it's arrogant for something that 
is so short lives to think it's even remotely signifigant in the grand 
scale of things.  I'm sure that people in mesometamia thought they were the 
height of hunanity and now they are mentioned for at most 1/2 in the first 
week of high school world history, and that's it.

Taking that as an example....  you get what I'm talking about.

Planet will be fine
Life (as in the sum total) will exist
Humans, and the current life as we know it, that remains to be seen.

There are still others that still go and place priority on things other 
than the party aspect.  It's just that it's THAT aspect that has become 
the predominant one.  (And bm's ticket response email address is even 
partiserve@burningman.org, so why should anyone be surprised.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: BIG FUCKING TRUCKS AND SUVS AND SHIT!


I still think its' funny how CO2 is now "evil".

Ya.  let's elimate it, and watch the plants die.  When I was studying 
various sciences (planetary, geo, bio etc) the big culprit for the 
atmosphere was always CO (not CO2) and CFC's.  The CO would bump and 
collide with CO3 (Ozone) and create the CO2 (IIRC, it's been a 
while).  Direct COP2 emmissions wasn't teh issue per se, so to keep yelling 
about it is rather misleading.  In fact the solution would be to put out 
CO2 exhausts and plats more trees.

In fact, planting more trees, plants and CO2 burners are the most easy and 
local solution IMHO (and if you saw my house and back yard you'd see I 
actually believe in this).l  Tangent-  My iris's are getting out of control 
so if anyone is around TI and would like some VERY easy to grow maint free 
flowering bulbs, ping me off list and I'll hook you up)

As for the new gen ravers....   Think about this...

You're doing your meth, and E, K, and other designer drugs.  Ask yourself 
this- Where does that come from?  Trees?  lol.  No no...  it's called a 
lab.  With chemicals, and chances are, in teh case of meth, it's being made 
in some bathtub in a track house up north in Windsor.  You can't walk 
through that town without smelling Acetone and ether on every street.  Why 
a bathtub?  Cause when they're done they pull the plug and let it 
go....  right into the water system, sewage, and sometimes right into 
streams and such.

So, consider how much you're contributeing to the pollution, toxic dumping 
and such everytime you get high.

Lounge, Dub Beautiful, False Profit, and Music Without Borders (Get
Freaky, Muti Music, and Raindance)! Art and decor by Anon Salon.

The How Weird Street Faire is centered at Howard and 12th Street, in the
SOMA district of San Francisco. At that intersection, there will be a
mandala made of grass =96 the world's only urban crop circle =96 where
festival-goers can relax, connect, and learn about fostering peace.

Please bike or take public transportation to the faire. There will be a
bike valet service provided by the SF Bicycle Coalition. The faire is
located two blocks south of Market Street & Van Ness.

Entrance at 12th Street and South Van Ness, San Francisco, Earth.
Requested donation of $5 in costume, or $10 without (kids free).
All ages welcome. Colorful costumes strongly encouraged!
All proceeds benefit two Bay Area non-profit organizations.

Had this one next in the Quote of the Day virtual basket, next I mean  
if I went in order it would be on Monday, but what the hell might as  
well post it now.  Another scientist who is skeptical of man made  
global warming.  Check it out, do your own research and get back with  
us.

And have a nice weekend.

--

Believe it or not, Global Warming is not due to human contribution of
Carbon Dioxide (CO2). This in fact is the greatest deception in the
history of science. We are wasting time, energy and trillions of
dollars while creating unnecessary fear and consternation over an
issue with no scientific justification.

- Dr. Tim Ball

Subject: [sfraves] WAS global warming NOW libertarians...

Ok - so this is odd to me. I have met a shitload of "libertarians" in the 
last maybe, decade or so.

What I don't get...roughly 50% of the ones I have personally interacted with 
or paid attention to make PERFECT sense, and kind of flow with the whole 
"live and let live within reason" mode. The other 50% are like, total 
seemingly-conservative wackjobs.

Democrats seem to be consistantly boring and non-effective passive-agressive 
types, and Republicans almost always strike me as arrogant, self centered, 
closed minded folks, with very few exceptions in either case.

Why is the whole Libertarian thing so teeter-totter? Why such a huge 
discrepancy? Is it just me?

Discuss. Or not.

LOL!

I've known more hippy-types and squatter-punk types that are more 
environmentally conscious (or environmentally tyranical depending on how you 
look at it) than I have ravers. Seems like most ravers are fairly liberal, 
but tend to be conservative on certain topics. Not the rule, but to me, a 
common experience.

You know who you are. Hit me up about something special.

Seriously...do it. Fun times for the family ;)



Oh yea - and while I enjoyed Bassbin Twins tonight at RubySkye, I am sure 
plenty of folks will have been disappointed. Peter Tall really went techy 
and housey. I was happily surprised, as I have only really seen him do very 
popular and common shit. Maybe it's from having been "raised" on the east 
coast ravey scene - which is far less open to experimenting. Who knows. At 
any rate, it was good for being free. Truth be told, I liekd WORTHY more 
than Mr.Tall tho.

Yadda.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WAS global warming NOW libertarians...


It's what happens when you mash half conservative and half liberal ideals 
together.  I've never met a libertarian that's 100% party lines..  it's 
usually 60-80% party line.  The general agreement is that "While I don't 
agree with everything, the fact that it's open to debate and is better than 
the other two choices, makes it worth it"

I lean towards most of the libertarian ideas...  but not all.  Giov't out 
of my house, yes.  Decriminalize most drugs, yes.  Open borders- no.  100% 
free trade - no.  A ratified and permanate foreign policy- oh FUCK 
YES.  Business haveing no restrictions - no.  Smaller federal gov't with 
more state rights - yes.

OTOH, I think the idea of the Natural Law party is kinda cool.  Basically a 
mash of The Green Party and Libertarian.  It's kinda like Libertarian, but 
gives a shit about the enviorment.

I still think its' funny how CO2 is now "evil".

Ya.  let's elimate it, and watch the plants die.  When I was studying 
various sciences (planetary, geo, bio etc) the big culprit for the 
atmosphere was always CO (not CO2) and CFC's.  The CO would bump and 
collide with CO3 (Ozone) and create the CO2 (IIRC, it's been a 
while).  Direct COP2 emmissions wasn't teh issue per se, so to keep yelling 
about it is rather misleading.  In fact the solution would be to put out 
CO2 exhausts and plats more trees.

In fact, planting more trees, plants and CO2 burners are the most easy and 
local solution IMHO (and if you saw my house and back yard you'd see I 
actually believe in this).l  Tangent-  My iris's are getting out of control 
so if anyone is around TI and would like some VERY easy to grow maint free 
flowering bulbs, ping me off list and I'll hook you up)

As for the new gen ravers....   Think about this...

You're doing your meth, and E, K, and other designer drugs.  Ask yourself 
this- Where does that come from?  Trees?  lol.  No no...  it's called a 
lab.  With chemicals, and chances are, in teh case of meth, it's being made 
in some bathtub in a track house up north in Windsor.  You can't walk 
through that town without smelling Acetone and ether on every street.  Why 
a bathtub?  Cause when they're done they pull the plug and let it 
go....  right into the water system, sewage, and sometimes right into 
streams and such.

So, consider how much you're contributeing to the pollution, toxic dumping 
and such everytime you get high.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: global warming articles and scientific revolutions

http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSL052735320070406 from today's Google News

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070228-mars-warming.html a contrarian viewpoint.

Note the argument in the second article that questions tha validity of the contrarian viewpoint because "His views are completely at odds with the mainstream scientific opinion."  Whennever I read something like that my antenna goes up.

My father is a scientist and spent most of his life fighting with a group of other scientists that controlled the "mainstream scientific opinion" in his field which has to do with the transport of proteins across cell walls.  As it turns out, the mainstream scientific opinion was completely wrong in that case but this could not be proven until fairly recently with the advent of new technologies (x-ray microscopes) that allowed the process to be imaged in vivo.  

Prior to that development, there were competing theories and various arguments that showed the mainstream opinion just had to be right.  Experiments and articles that showed otherwise were supressed and couldn't get published in peer reviewed journals, funding was cut off for related research, tenure was denied to scientists working on the opposing theory, etc.  And this was for research that might leas to treatments for deadly diseases like cystic fibrosis.

Mainstream scientific opinion is a factor of many things which often have nothing to do with the validity of a theory or hypothesis.  Try getting a research grant for an experiment to show global warming isn't caused by humans.  Not only won't you get the grant, but simply trying to get it might end your scientific career.

See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions

Note that this doesn't prove that "global warming" isn't caused by humans, but it should give you pause before you blindly accept the idea that "mainstream scientific opinion" is always correct.

Regards,

Peter

I'm going so I'll still be reading news and hopefully can convince =20

So, you seem to be implying that I am a pussy becuase I drive a Volkswagen?

I don't need a big truck to make me feel like a man.  I certinaly don't need
three.

But hey! live it up while you can.  Drive your big trucks... burn that oil
and spew that CO2.  I mean, the whole world is just fucked anyway, right?  
Nothing anyone of us can do about it, right?  Our personal lifestyle 
decisions have no effect on the world around us, right?

Having a big truck for the sake of having one seems pointless.  Howevever, I
do have a fullsize 4x4 dodge ram 1500 that I use quite often for moving
equipment from point A to point B.  But on the flipside, I take muni to and
from work, and try to take it on the weekends as well.  Filling the beasts
belly is nearing the $90 mark which just seems a crime in itself compared to
muni's $45 monthly fastpass!

If you need a big truck, i have no problems with someone owning one.

Yes, this is America and we have freedom and you should have freedom to
drive whatever you want. However, the cost of "Image Trucks" is high.
They destroy our roads faster.  We rely more on foriegn oil.  We have to
pay 100s of billions to occupy far-off oil-rich lands.  Our air quality 
suffers. Highway safety suffers.

But again, hey! at least I've got a BITCHIN' BIG TRUCK!!!

so if i own two volkswagens does that mean i'm a double pussy?  i'm  
really scared of big hairy men with tattoos all over their arms and  
necks.

i tell you guys, i really wish i had my S10 with this move right now  
going on.  it was so convenient to be able to just throw shit in the  
back of the truck and drive on.  only thing was those damn 700R4  
trannies ... lack of adequate cooling for fluid would burn them out  
fast.  transmission fluid's probably not good for the environment.

but let me tell you something about the high seas for a minute.  it's  
vast and i believe can suck up a lot of stuff and you'd never know it  
was there.  so environmentalism?  maybe relative, to a certain  
degree.  with moderation.

Have any of you guys ever experienced an E flashback? It has been about 1
1/2 - 2 years since I last dropped. On my way to work this morning I
listened to a CD of one of my old favorite ambient tracks (Amazone -
Amphetamine released in '94). For the first time in a long time I listened
to music driving instead of political talk radio because I was testing out a
stock 91 honda cd player add on I bought off ebay for $20. When I heard the
song, it immediately pulled me into this strange state of mind. My chest
felt pressure and I had that feeling of being on E. The music suddenly
became everything and was crystal clear. Especially the sound of the
fat Juno 106 synth pad. It was euphoric, but uniquely depressing. Like I was
on a massive come down. I felt, felt strangely... suicidal. The thought of
driving into a deadly car crash was, at that moment, comforting. Well, don't
get me wrong, I wouldn't ever kill myself, and this is not a call for help.
The moment soon passed away as soon as I got to work and settled into my
normal routine. Luckily.

States of mind scare me, because when you are in your normal state of mind
it's hard to even realize that alternate states exist. I felt a way that I
hadn't felt in a long time, and it scared me.

Have a great weekend!

Sometimes music can trigger a memory for me...and take me to a place I
haven't been (mentally/emotionally) for a long time.  Scents can do that to
me as well...

Yup.  They're Pink and white.  Got them from my grandma by way of my mom.

I've actually got a seed pod this year, in addition to beaking up some of 
the clusters.

Also have a lot of hen's and chickens succulents that are red/pink with 
yell tips when they bloom.

The statement has nothing to do with what anyone drives- it's more to  
the point of some people being entirely content with living in all  
the air-conditioned comfort that modern society provides, while  
others just don't feel right in it, and thus behave like animals at  
times.

I have a truck because I own a house, and often have to haul a bunch  
of crap around.
It's not my daily driver- I have a car that gets 21mpg that I use,  
and beyond that had a Mercedes diesel running on vegetable oil until  
a month ago.

Though, if I could only afford one vehicle that needed to do  
everything I needed it to do, it would end up being a large pickup  
truck.

Well, at least you're putting it to use. There are FAR too many people 
rolling around in enormous gass guzzling vehicles that don't even use them 
for what they are intended. Do they have the right to? Absolutely. But that 
doesn't mean they aren't selfish asshats for doing so.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: global fucking warming

Misanthropy is highly underrated.

A life lesson I wish I had grasped much earlier, I'd be a lot better off 
and happier to boot.

But as they say, it's never too late, and I'm finding out that catching 
up is as easy as a can of corn, as it turns out.

Prudent, rational beings?

You're kidding, right?

This is the United States of America, where over the course of these 
next two years well over a billion, (that's billion with a "b"), dollars 
are going to spent on a Presidential election, where the winner gets to 
get a lousy job that only pays $400K, a year, for 4 years, and the way 
things are going, at the end of it, that winner may just be President 
Lynn Cheney and Vice President Ghouliani or Vice Condi Rice.

The vast majority of the American public can't even do the simple math 
to see just how nuts that is, so how do you expect to have a coherent 
conversation on something as complex as the weather?

Earth has weathered 5 major extinctions in its brief life, so far, and 
no doubt, before the sun goes out, it will see 5 more extinctions of 
life, some sentient, some not, come and go.

It's too bad we can't figure out a way to be nicer to each other while 
we're here, but there's no dollar percentage in that, so we won't.

Hello again, friends and fellow music lovers.

Rest up and dust off those dancing shoes, cuz Saturday night we're getting
together for our monthly dancefloor throwdown.  We've been wanting to have
Dapayk out for a long time now, and are really psyched to have him flying i=
n
from Berlin (accompanied by his girlfriend, German supermodel Eva Padberg)
for his California debut.  His music is engaging, artsy, and unique, withou=
t
ever losing that crucial "dancefloor factor" that keeps the room bouncing.
Oh man, he's going to sound sick on that thumping Endup system!  Justin
Maxwell is also going to be a special treat.  We saw last him at FunkyCozy'=
s
ridiculous "Compound" party alongside live sets by Pier Bucci and
[a]pendics.shuffle, and he really had the place rocking.

Another super-solid lineup you don't wanna miss.

Hope to see you tomorrow!

-----> Greg, Alland, Nikola, Sammy, & Craig

DAPAYK

Over the course of time, Niklas Worgt has used his share of project names,
the most well known of which would have to be Dapayk. Since 1993, Niklas ha=
s
crafted his own tracks. Cuts with drum&bass and breakbeat sport the same
difference as pumpin' techno and techhouse. As the drum&bass live act
"Frauds in White" he started to make a name for himself on the barely
developed breakbeat scene of middle Germany in the mid-90's. As "Sonstware"
he held residence at parties and stepped into the late 90's as Dapayk. Ther=
e
were a few years, however, between then and 2001 when he released his first
record. From that release, Dapayk was basically taken as the cornerstone
alias for his various projects on his label, Mo's Ferry Productions.

In cooperation with German topmodel Eva Padberg there came the project
Dapayk&Padberg. After the first single was released in 2005, a first album
was released, reaching the years Top 10 charts in respected German magazine=
s
Groove, De-bug, and Raveline, as well as bringing Niklas a Top 10 spot in
the producer charts. His sound can be characterized as "prickling" displays
of the art of balancing electronics music's Minimal, Electronica and
Breakbeat forms.  Together with his school mate Jan Langhammer he founded
Mo's Ferry daughter labels "Fenou" and "Rrygular" as the playground for
electronica and minimal techno respectively. In addition to his work as
Dapayk, since the beginning of 2006 Niklas has released techno tracks as
"Marek Bois" on Trapez and Rrygular.

In 2006 Dapayk's first solo album was released. He entered again the top 10
of the poll charts of German techno magazine Groove as best producer, best
live act and with the album itself.  Dapayk has released on labels such as
Karloff, Textone, Orac, Contexterrior, Trapez, Resopal, Friends of Tomorrow=
,
Mo's Ferry Prod., Fenou and Rrygular.

JUSTIN MAXWELL

Justin Maxwell invented music with one hand, and he can destroy it with the
other.  A frequent collaborator with Miss Teen USA (1996, 1998), John
Tejada, and 1/2 of the electro duo Volsoc, professional sound designer for
popular synths and software, and even once producing a remix for Georgio
Moroder, he's released a pantload of gritty, weird bleepy crap over the pas=
t
few years and has gained about 10 pounds since moving to San Francisco.
Favoring synthesizer accidents and ugly sounds, his releases receive
intimate aural cuddling by Anja Schneider, Laurent Garnier, Steve Bug, Mike
Shannon, Andrea Parker, and a good amount of praise from the UK and French
writers.   Also, he recently grew a beard.

ANDRE LUCERO

A veteran of West Coast underground electronic music culture, Andr=E9 Lucer=
o
continues to reinvent himself.  From breakdancing in the early 80's to his
present studio efforts, he always kept his focus on beats and sounds of
genres to come.  Starting with the earliest electro hip-hop, passing throug=
h
time and space to the present and future of electronic music, his selection=
s
are open minded but always have a dancefloor sensibility.

Not being satisfied with spoon feeding or accepting convenience, Andr=E9 ha=
s
chosen the paths less traveled.  Helping foster the rave scene in Santa
Barbara; playing at the first mega-rave in the US (Raveamerica); releasing
one of the first (if not THE first) underground electronic dance music mixe=
d
CD's (Fusion, Volume 1); his involvement with the seminal San Francisco
techhouse event/DJ crew, Urban Development; to playing with international
legends for Space Children, he has been recognized for decades as a stand
alone talent who brings something special to the lineup.  Sharing the decks
with some of the heaviest hitters on the planet, he understands how to rock
a crowd as well as to tell a story.  No two sets from Andr=E9 are alike.  E=
ach
moment drives the relevance of the music selection.  Each moment is unique.
The sound: warm, spacey, funky, soulful techno.  Currently he is working on
several projects in studio, including tracks with [KONTROL] resident Nikola
Baytala.

Water balloons seem problematic as a boob substitute.  

No biting I guess and where's the fun in that? Ask any baby. ;)

Greetings Cosmonauts!

 

Everything's falling into place here at Yuri's Night Bay Area HQ, this event
is shaping up to be AMAZING. We'll skip the small talk and get straight to
the goods, we're sure you're just as busy as we are...

 

************

TRANSPORTATION UPDATE

 

We've just updated the transportation page on our website to include a
rideshare forum and information on taking Caltrain to the event. We strongly
encourage everyone to carpool or take public transportation. Carpools will
park for free!

 

We will be running shuttles to/from the Mtn. View Caltrain station all
evening and again when the trains start up in the morning. There's a section
on the forum for coordinating Caltrain times if you want to meet up with
others on the same train (we think everyone should meet on the last car of
the train, but that's just us).

 

For more info on getting to the event, please visit
http://worldspaceparty.com/travel.php

 

************

TICKET UPDATE

 

Online ticket sales have been phenomenal, far higher than we expected! If
you haven't bought your presale ticket yet, we encourage you to do so, this
event may sell out and tickets at the door will be at least $40. Tickets are
currently onsale through In Ticketing and at walk in outlets for $30.

 

Yuri's Night Bay Area is now selling tickets at the following two  outlets,
please pay them a visit! If you get your paper ticket at an outlet now, you
can skip the will call line at the event. We hope to add more locations
soon, for now, you can buy tickets at:

 

Reverb Records-

1816 Haight Street in San Francisco (at Stanyan), (415) 221-4142

 

Ceiba Records-

1364 Haight Street in San Francisco (at Masonic), (415) 437-9598

 

Please visit http/wwww.worldspaceparty.org/tickets.php for more information
on ticket sales.

 

**********

 

We continue to add artists, scientists, performers, technology demos,
vendors and more to the event. Please stay informed at
www.worldspaceparty.org.

 

Can't wait to see all of you there!

 

overandout,

 

Yuri's Night Bay Area Crew

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid them.
But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for your dreams
than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're fighting for."  -Paulo
Coelho  

 

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap of
empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another person. ln
those transparent moments we know other people's joys and sorrows, and we
care about their concerns as if they were our own."  -Fritz Williams 

 

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but it
worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: BIG FUCKING TRUCKS AND SUVS AND SHIT!

True enough.  Though while I believe Scott when he says he puts his  
truck to actual use as a cargo carrier;  isn't it curious how almost  
every other time this topic comes up, anywhere on the internet, you  
pretty much *ALWAYS* seem to wind up talking to that one person in  
who-knows-how-many who actually drives a truck or SUV for its  
intended use as a cargo carrier instead of a I-have-a-small-penis-so- 
I-drive-a-big-truck-mobile?  What are the odds?

Meanwhile, if I were to go out and take a walk today, and steal  
glances into the "cargo" areas of the parked trucks and SUVs I pass  
by; I'd bet good money that I'd pass ten... maybe even twenty...  
empties for every one that's actually hauling.


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: 2NITE!!!!: OtherWorld's 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY @ OASIS!!!!! (Oakland, CA)

Hey folks,

Can't believe it's already been a year since the OW posse has started 
throwing events at Oasis! We're celebrating our 1 year anniversary in 
typical OW style. If you've been to Oasis, then you know how dope this spot 
is...VERY relaxed, cheap & stiff drinks, a nice outdoor area to enjoy 
smokeables, etc. If you don't know, then get your ass to Oasis and find 
out!!!

****NOTE - For some of you breaks enthusiasts, I'm decided to pull out all 
the "nuskool" shit I could find from around '97 to '02 - so this will be an 
interesting look back into a subgenre that managed to meander it's way into 
signifigance in the dance music world of today.****

>Your selektahs for the evening:

>Marc(O) - OtherWorld//Ill Behavior//Mario Bros.//The MidnightSons
>Raheim Jihad - Reflections
>Kellee - OtherWorld
>Liz Rowdy - OtherWorld
>El Juan Hubbard - Hijinx
>Shortbus - TBI 25
>396 -  Switchcraft
>Naked Slice - Oaklyn Records

And if you make it out to this, I'm pretty sure your ears will be made 
privvy to something very tasty in the works for later in April ;)

Subject: [sfraves] Question about Dj Dave from Liquid

Does anyone know where Dj Dave that used to mix at the Liquid (like 4 years ago, that's club near the skylark) plays now ? Or if he has a website or an email address where I could contact him. He used to play some sick progressive house and I'd like to find that kind of music again !

Thanks

FRI MARCH 30          FUTURE OF ALTERNATIVE CLUBBING SYMPOSIUM @ Synergy
[FULLY FILMED AND NOW BEING EDITED BY Gungho Media, AVAILABLE ONLINE =
SOON]

I'll be talking to some of the greatest organisers in the history of
Alternative Clubbing and Alternative venues and I feel humbled.  They =
are
Fraser Clark Mary Hawkins (WHIRL-Y-GIG), Jeff Dexter (ROUNDHOUSE), =
Sionaidh
Craigen (MEGATRIPOLIS), Dominik Schnell (SYNERGY), Steve Peake =
(SYNERGY),
Mark Heley (TOONTOWN) (MEGATRIPOLIS, WARP EXPERIENCE),=20

I am going to briefly re-clarify the general format and content of the
FUTURE OF ALTERNATIVE CLUBBING SYMPOSIUM.  Note that I am not going to =
go
into detail about every topic I will bring up as we need to be somewhat
spontaneous.  This will be a flowing discussion not an academic series =
of
presentations. =20

FORMAT: Basically I am going to bring up a series of themes and topics =
and
then call on people on the panel to elaborate.  The following are =
possible
themes I will bring up but I might surprise you.  They are not =
necessarily
in the order I will bring them up on the nite, except for VISION/HISTORY
which will definitely be first.  QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE will come =
after
each theme is explored, but they must ask a question on that specific =
theme.

CONTENT:

1) VISION/HISTORICAL CONTEXT: The first theme will definitely be VISION =
but
within that context I would hope that you will give the audience a brief
HISTORICAL overview of what was going on at the time, in the club scene =
and
counterculture, to spur on that VISION.  Jeff Dexter in particular (whom =
I
will start off with) will hopefully fill us in on the Sixties context =
(UFO,
TECHNICOLOUR DREAM, MIDDLE EARTH etc) before he describes his VISION for =
the
ROUNDHOUSE.

PERSONAL MINDSET is very welcome and important within this VISION =
context.
How were you feeling at the time they decided to start or be part of the
club(s) we will be talking about.  I might specify certain clubs for you =
to
focus on.  For example, I would expect Fraser (Clark) to talk in detail
about MEGATRIPOLIS.  And where the Counterculture 'was at' at the time, =
plus
where Fraser was at.  Then I might focus him on the WARP EXPERIENCE as =
that
too was a seminal club.  Again, first some HISTORICAL context, and that =
will
lead into his specific VISION  for his specific club or Alternative =
venue,
for the clubbers themselves and perhaps for him personally.

2) RELATIONSHIPS WITH FELLOW ORGANISERS: This is a real touchy one and I
wouldn't expect it to be otherwise.  Why did promoters choose the =
specific
people to work with whom they chose?  Did they see themselves as being =
in
harmony with them?  Did they know they had flaws before they got =
involved
with them or did they just see them with angelic lenses?  What were the =
good
points for organisers when working with fellow organisers?  Male =
organisers
relationship with women organisers will also feature?

Which memorable specific problems (if any) emerged with organisers' =
working
partners, what was the nature of those problems, why did they evolve and =
-
within this context - how and when organisers decide they couldn't work =
with
that person(s) any more?  Again some specific HISTORY for the audience.  =
Not
too much and not too little.  I want the audience to know (and they and =
I
want to know) what was going on in the specific clubs in some detail
including the actual splits and battles but not to the point where it
becomes a book :)  I don't mind if organisers get heated and passionate, =
but
there=92s no need for nastiness when talking about this aspect of =
things.
Obviously certain organisers may feel they were treated badly by other
organisers and I don't want to hide that from the audience; quite the
opposite.  But remember organisers are in front of an audience who =
expect a
certain level of New Edge decorum.  Finally I want to hear what lessons =
have
been learned in regard to working with other organisers.

3) MONEY: Always an interesting one.  May overlap with the RELATIONSHIPS
WITH FELLOW ORGANISERS problems, but that overlap is to be expected.  =
What
was each organiser=92s money situation when they moved to start their =
club or
get involved?  How did organisers raise the money?  Within the club how =
did
panelists decide who got paid what (including yourself) and how did that
manifest itself?  How did organisers decide how much dj's were paid?  =
And
how much the audience was charged?

What problems within the club(s) they were/are involved with emerged =
over
money issues and how were they affected?  How did they deal with and =
solve
these problems?

4) RELATIONSHIPS WITH STAFF: How did you envision that initially and how =
did
that change if at all?   How did you choose who ran a room or who didn't =
run
a room?  What problems (if any) emerged from that scenario?  How did you
choose who worked in several other jobs within the club?  How did you =
relate
to those people?  Did staff respect you?  Did staff resent you?  What
lessons did you learn within that context.

5) RELATIONSHOP WITH THE AUDIENCE:  Prices, Drugs, Sex Specific Musical
Tastes, Blagging. General Treatment of Clubbers (including by security) =
and
the concept of LOVE come in within this theme.  Did you try and =
personally
relate to the audience?  What did they think of you?  How did you try =
and
improve things for the clubbers?

6) RELATIONS WITH SECURITY:.... A controversial topic to be sure.  Use =
your
imagination

7) RELATIONSHIP WITH PERFORMERS: My fave subject, specifically DJ's.  =
Again,
how did you choose who was going to perform on the nite?  How did you =
relate
to performers?  What sort of problems emerged (if any).

8) RELATIONSHIP TO COMMUNITY:  Other clubs, the counterculture, the =
local
mainstream community..... how did you and your club relate to them?

9) CHANGES: How has the Alternative Clubbing scene changed, and how have =
you
and your club(s) changed over the years within that context?  What =
general
lessons have been learned by the whole scene, your club(s) and you
personally.   Very important theme.

10) THE FUTURE OF CLUBBING:  Which direction do you see the Alternative
Clubbing scene going in?  Which direction do you WANT to see the =
Alternative
Clubbing scene travel in?  Do you see a role for yourself in that and if =
so
what?

That's it for the moment folks remember these themes are not set in
concrete.  E-mail me anything else you would like to see included.  =
Again be
concise without ignoring things.

And remember we are all about LOVING one another even if seems =
impossible at
times.    xxxxGoodJeff.=20

How much did that have to do with anything?  You're polarizing an issue 
that may have some merit... perhaps they really care about the 
environment *and* want a little dreadlocked punani too.

Oh, and also, when you post "facts"...
http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/Gases/man.html

The historical data that supports many of the Global Warming theorist's 
claims is based on ice and soil records... we don't have to be there with 
a thermometer doing gas chromatography right then a there to know certain 
things.

Personally if it is a "fear", it's a harmless fear, because energy 
depletion is real, political issues due to oil availability are real, so 
getting all smug about global warming doesn't do to much about the fact 
that burning hydrocarbons for power isn't sustainable... and the options 
for the most part are a tougher road.  Global warming/Anthropogenic 
Climate Change is something that is still developing as a case but more 
and more scientists seem to buy in every year... but fact or fiction most 
estimates for viable oil sources state we have between 40-120 years left 
(the petroleum industry itself places viable stores at ~=50 years with a 
glimmer of optimism that we might find more... but this number does not 
account for usage growth which has been massively rising in india and 
china).

The fact is immutable, the majority of every hydrocarbon burned goes 
directly into water vapor and CO2 (including methanol, biodiesel, lpg, 
natural gas, oil, etc), we burn a LOT of it, and it's worth consideration 
that it might have effects on our environment.  And that's the cleanest 
fuels being burned perfectly, it gets substantially uglier in real world 
combustion where we get particulates, NOx'es, sulfur compounds and all 
that other good stuff.  If you don't think this stuff matters, or that we 
can't really fuck things up, read up a little bit on past theories that 
we've found to be true.  People disputed acid rain all through the 60s and 
70s, but by now it's bonafide verifiable fact with trangible 
ramifications.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain

Acid rain can (and has) been mostly held by back using better catalyzers 
in coal and oil burning facilities and advances in automotive technology, 
but there is simply no way to burn a hydrocarbon and not get CO2 (and yes, 
that includes private jets flying Gore around and seagoing vessels with 
pandas painted on the side).  So that solves the acid rain issue (carbons 
will only drop atmospheric water's pH to about 6.5), but maybe, if we're 
emitting a lot of it from stored caches dating back millions of years, 
it's gonna cause some problems.

Most of what we see as the call to action for "Global Warming", should 
already be sonsidered given other reasons for trying to reduce energy 
consumption... because *all* the problems with fossil fuels go hand in 
hand.  The only fuel sources where we see a divergence is plant sources 
like biodeisel/methanol/ethanol where they do have ramifications on global 
warming but not fossil fuel stores... and of course "clean" sources like 
hydro/wind/solar/not-yet viable fusion reaktors.  Oh, and if you've been 
following the news lately, nuclear fission based plants are most likely 
going to see a resurgence with all this crap going on about fossil fuels 
and global warming... interesting to say the least.  Permits are being 
applied for new facilities for the first time in 30 years or so in the US.

EXACTLY...

If someone were to write "Global Warming for Dummies"
they could wright about 1 page in my book.

Over hundreds of millions of years, different species,
catastrophic violent events, and millions of
micro-organisms degraded, consumed and re-tooled the
planet, In order to make it livable for new more
specific species... which was more of an accident than
a plan. In turn, the actions of these "creatures" over
millions of years created the breathable climate we
have inherited. Now, in 150 yrs, maybe 300 yrs max,
the human species is attempting to unearth, undo,
dig-up, and re-introduce the work that took hundreds
of millions of years for the biosphere to
accomplish... and put it right back in the air.

We are blacking out the sky, like the volcanoes that
formed our planet, re-configuring chemicals and
re-introducing them into the ground, with no plan and
no capacity to wait another 300 million years for the
biosphere to sort it out.

ANd most depressing, getting Hummers off the road with
Toxic Battery laden hybrid cars is only going to
create the next environmental nightmare, as the
millions of chemically derived batteries break down
into toxic nightmares upon their end-of-life.

Lets have kids.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: The Most Interesting Documentary I've Seen In a Long Time

Unfortunately the bee die off is real, and is not a theoretical possiblilty based on computer simulations like many of the worst case global warming projections.

Here's a decent article on the topic from the NYT: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/business/27bees.html?ei=5087&en=954295e51db99bbe&ex=1188795600&excamp=mkt_at2&pagewanted=print

I never knew there was such a job as migratory bee keeper, but there it is.   I once had a job as a "puppet brusher", but this is up there with weird job titles.

As far as the GW debate, did you know that not all of the computer models of global warming agree with the dire predictions contained in the IPCC forecasts recently released?  

For example, apparently 16/19 models used by the IPCC support the drier southwest/new dustbowl scenario which got a lot of press here, while 3 of their models predict some other outcome.  But try to find out what these 3 other models predict and you won't be able to find it.  I guess we just have to wait for the real IPCC report to be released later this month.

As anyone that works with complicated simulations can tell you agreement of multiple simulation models which often also share basic assumptions is no guarantee against error nor is it a protection against false predictions.   And in order to understand the outputs of these models, you often need to know quite a bit about how they were set up and run.

I couldn't find much on the models used in the current IPCC report, but here's a technical paper on the models used a few years back: http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/IPCCTP.II(E).pdf    

Global warming is a real observable and measureable phenomena, but the predictions from these models are something else.  With that said, apparently the prediction record from the previous IPCC reports isn't that bad (see http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/02/the-ipcc-fourth-assessment-summary-for-policy-makers/)

It seems to me that its worth remembering the difference between a physical change we can observe and measure, and a prediction of such a change made from computer simulations of unknown accuracy.

Peace,

Peter

I think the Penn & Teller "Bullshit" episode about PETA pretty much 
destroyed all credibility they might have had.

PETA is a fucking JOKE. Great concept, but total bullshit.

I blame the grape industry.

Everyone use dto complain about cows, and howe how farts are destroying the 
ozone and causing global warming.  This is why I'm sorta sick of hearing 
about it, because EVERYTHING apparently causes global warming (not denying 
it, but let's narrow it down, shall we?).

I grew up in Sonoma County.  It was cow country, the home of Clover Milk & 
other dairy.  Cows were cool.  They milled around, walked the hills, 
etc.  Big open lands with grass, flowers, and basically, wild open land.

Well, enter the "cows are bad!" and the LA yuppies moving up to "the 
country" who love wine.  They drove the demand of wine through teh 
roof.   What a wonderful industry.  Everyone thinks it's a wonderful 
Agorian industry.

As I said, nothing good for the enviorment about it.

Let's start with the serilization of dirt.  We're talking about the 
complete killing of everything in the ground.  All bugs, germs, worms, 
bacteria.  Everything.  That alone should throw up warning flags.  They 
pump a lot of nasty toxins, pesticides, tri-ox, and such to completely kill 
everything.  When this is going on, the fields are covered in white 
plastic.  Now, somehow, all this crap doesn't get into the water 
table?  Riiiiight.

Next, they pump the soil with all of the exact chemicals they need to get a 
very specific taste to the grape, reproducing the chemical content for "the 
good years" when it happened naturally.  we're talking a major outdoor lab.

Whiel we're on the subject...  we talk about the destriction of the 
rainforests, but never hear about teh clear cutting of our local areas for 
wine growers do you?  Can't have trees on a vineyard, so they clear out 
everything.  Kendal jackson is famopus for this, including old growth hills 
despite there being local laws against this.  He just pays the fine and 
keeps on cutting.  Next winter you get mudd slides, reduced rain, and total 
climate changes in the valley.

Hate it.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Organic foods?

so i got into a discussion slash argument with my brother regarding
organic foods and i wanted to hear what the general population has to
say.

i commented that the dinner i was preparing for us was composed of
primarily organic ingredients, and he pursued a tirade about how there
is no such thing as "organic" crops, since any crops in existence
would have already been "taken over" by GMO/non-organic crops because
they are "engineered" to take over other crops. also, he said that
organic farmers are paid off by the government to produce this
allegedly "organic" food.

now i dont know much about anything, i just kind of go with the flow.
but i know for a fact that my "organic" apples are much smaller and
ridden with blemishes as compared to "non-organic" apples that are
big, shiney, red & totally flawless. to me, that would indicate that
the two fruits genetically differ from each other. but that is just a
hypothesis, i am no scientist.

i am too lazy to look this crap up on the interweb and i KNOW that
there is a SFR presence that has an educated opinion on the subject.

In Great Britain, they are having this debate, and in many ways, seem ahead of us on it (due to Mad Cow disease, etc.). The government there says, "it's no better": http://www.netscape.com/viewstory/2007/01/07/organic-food-is-no-better-says-minister/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timesonline.co.uk%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C2087-2535313%2C00.html&frame=true

which is total crap.

you want to keep eating pesticides and chemicals until someone "proves" 
it's bad for you?  go ahead.

there is so much information available about this topic that it's easy 
to spin it any way you want, but again, i defer to my own senses when 
making a decision.  organic produce tastes SO MUCH better than 
"conventional" produce (who the fuck made up that term, anyway?), it's 
not even a difficult decision for me.

as for genetically-engineered crops, it's funny (in a sad way) when you 
read the literature about all the supposed virtues that are designed 
into them - pest and disease resistance, unharmed by pesticides, 
engineered to be immune to certain herbicides (so weeds can be killed 
without harming the crop), extended shelf life, lack of cosmetic 
defects - but what's missing from that list, of course, is TASTE and 
NUTRITION.  go buy some tomatoes at Safeway and you'll see what I mean.

stick with organic produce, grown close to home.  buy at a CCOF 
farmer's market and you can't go wrong.

In that second link, I like this comment to the article:

Shock horror - mass produced food, made in the cheapest way possible, is no=
t
as good for you as organic food. Is anyone surprised? Mass-produced cars ar=
e
not as good as individually-tuned cars. Mass-produced buildings (concrete
jungles or modern estates) are not as good as individually made homes. This
is not surprising, because when you mass produce something, you get cheaper
and easily maintainable products, at the cost of quality.

Lets drop the pretense - organic food in the modern world is a luxury.
Unfertilised wheat yields are around 1-2%. Fertilising with manure can give
yields around 6%. Good inorganic fertilisers, or inorganic nitrogen-based
fertilisers mixed with manure give yields of close to 10%. So, we have a
choice - inorganic fertilisers producing cheap food, or people starving. Pu=
t
down the champagne and go to a cheap supermarket - I don't choose to eat
cheap, processed food - I have to. If you have enough money, you can buy
yourself better food, but don't pretend that cheap food is an evil until yo=
u
have no money.

ah yes, but what about using a biomass-building cover crop with a 
legume to fix the nitrogen in the soil? you'll get much better soil 
that way, and you don't even have to buy fertilizer - just collect the 
seed from your cover crop before turning it in to the soil.

there are other options besides "inorganic fertilizers or starving 
people".

And safeway is WAY republican-centric (http://www.getblue.info/safeway)

I'm glad someone is talking about organic foods, I'll try to chime in  
on it later on today.  Here's a quote from a 9/11 truther, his father  
was a firefighter that was killed on 9/11 and he died just a few  
months ago.  His family doesn't want to reveal the cause but they also  
say they don't think there was foul play.  If you look on Google Video  
or You Tube you can look for the video where Dan get into it with an  
NBC anchorman, oh well I'll try to find the link.  It's a good video.   
A shame to lose people with such courage.

Woah.  I never knew that one.  That's a good enough, by itself,  
reason never to shop there again.  Not that TJs and Costco don't  
already get most of my business.  But there've been a handful of  
things I still swing over to safeway to buy.  I guess I'll start  
either hitting up FoodsCo or doing without.

Another similar poison pill I found on someone's livejournal and  
confirmed on Wikipedia a few months back....  Rockstar, the one that  
makes the energy drink oh so popular at parites and clubs, is  
actually a front for the the Weiner family business.  If that doesn't  
sound familiar, than you'll know them by the pseudonym used in public  
by their patriarch:  Michael Savage.

That last particular bit of vileness was enough for me immediately to  
switch to Monster...  which turned out to be that much more of a  
blessing in disguise.  I actually like the flavor of blue Monster  
better than rockstar anyway!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Organic foods?

Occasionally I notice a difference in flavor, only a vague one though. 
Beyond that, the only big difference I notice in organic foods is the higher 
price.

Free range meats though...those I think tend to taste a bit better. Not sure 
that counts though.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Organic foods?

We have some Asian markets here in the Richmond that have organic foods, and 
they are cheaper - but I can tell you this - the quality of beggies is VERY 
hit or miss. Often times the veggies are just NAPPY.

One thing I can say about most grocery stores (except Safeway), is they tend 
to have at least consistant quality of fruits/veggies. Maybe not all fancy 
and organic, but they aren't half rotten and nappy.

I actually have found the best veggies in the Bay Area in two spots - the 
Farmers Market in Berkeley (go figure), and Trader Joes.

That was my livejournal-

And- yeah- his son started and runs it.
Would you really call that a "front for the Weiner family business"?
Are you a front for your dad's business?

I'm just curious-

Does anyone actually know *anything* about what they buy at a =20
farmer's market?
Like- have you visited the farm or something?
I dunno about the rest of you, but everything I see at "farmer's =20
markets" is in similar crating as what I see delivered to Safeway.
Like yanno- Safeway gets their produce from farms too...

And I'll guess it likely that dad fronted (as an investment) a 
substantial amount of money to get it off the ground.  Or not.  If he 
did, then the answer would be yes.

Google is my friend:

http://www.nndb.com/people/588/000044456/

http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/03/05/savage/index.html? 
pn=4

Rockstar's own website brags about their connection to savage.   
According to the wikipedia article, the rockstar company's board of  
directors includes others of the weiner family.  NNDB states that  
savages wife (under the weiner name) serves as rockstar's CFO.  Salon  
quotes rockstar russ as: "proud to be the son of Savage!", and cites  
instances of savage pimping rockstar on his radio show.

Aside from the company own website, all of the above it from just the  
first page of results for "michael savage rockstar".  And the case  
against russ weiner, his connection to savage, and his republican  
politics, just gets that much more damning if you do some digging  
past that one google page I mentioned.  Try crossreferencing savage,  
weiner, and their connection to and activities with the "Paul Revere  
Society".

If you know of russ weiner or the rockstar company ever disavowing or  
repudiating savage and the rest of the weiners, or of *anything* that  
would acquit them, please enlighten me.  Because the easily available  
evidence all points to their connection.


cya,
john

Huh ok- well I guess if you don't like Michael Savage then you  
shouldn't drink Rockstar-

I personally have no problem with the guy, so it doesn't affect me-
And their new guava stuff is the shit!

Maybe it's just around here then-
(San Jose)

The farmer's markets here seem to be mostly field-working mexicans  
who I presume bought the company stuff on discount and are reselling.

judged me or lowered my income based on my fathers political views.
Especially since I don't share them.

Yeah, but that's not the case here.  Rockstar russ is not some  
disowned and estranged black sheep who's disavowed and repudiated his  
savage and his family legacy; and gone off doing his own thing.  They  
are all tightly intertwined.

Don't take my word for it.  Read the links I provided.  Or google  
"michael savage rockstar" yourself, if you think I'm making it up.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Organic foods?

Back when I was at Live365 our ridiculous PR agency kept trying to hook us up with their other b-list clients which included (you guessed it) Steven Seagal.  First they wanted us to broadcast his blues band with some sort of "exclusive" deal.  Fine, but not a good deal for us.  Later they had some idea that we would broadcast audio of a party Seagal was having at his house.  I was never sure why anyone thought that would be interesting.
 
Check out http://www.stevenseagal.com/ where he plugs his CDs as well as the soda...
 
Peace,
 
Peter

My neighbor keeps bees in our shared backyard. I love it! The flowers etc.
are beautiful, and the honey is fabulous. I definitely think they're a
barometer of ecological health, as connected as bees are to everything
living.

Here is an episode of Forum about the missing honeybees:

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: The Most Interesting Organic Food Documentary I've Seen


I'm going to be up at my alma mater, UC Davis, for
Picnic Day this weekend.  I'm bringing a few copies of
our latest vinyl release (see:
http://www.discogs.com/release/817918 ) and a few CDs
of SCR.COMP.002 (see:
http://www.discogs.com/release/278758 ) so if you
happen to be on campus and you see a guy with a record
bag, that's probably me. Just run up and say hi and
I'll be happy to give you some music.

Word.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: ROOMATE WANTED!

My roomate and I are going ot be looking for ONE roomate as of May 1st!

We have a 3 bedroom flat in San Fran @ 3rd Avenue & Geary in the Inner 
Richmond. Huge backyard, good locale, tons of shopping & food right near us 
- Best Buy, Trader Joes and all sorts of other stuff within walking distance 
as well.

Rent will be between $650 - $700 per month (not including utilities), but 
utilities rarely run a whole lot past $60 a month. Price of rent will be 
determined by room, as one room is a bit smaller than the other 2.

Anyhoo - if you are EMPLOYED, not a dirty fucktard meth-head, 420 tolerant, 
responsible, EMPLOYED, not a dirty slob, etc. - then message me!

Very sad, but....

Life happens too fast for you ever to think about it. If you could  
just persuade people of this, but they insist on amassing information.

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles  
for your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap  
of empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."  - 
Fritz Williams

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone,  
but it worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

So one awkward question you can ask, when you're forking out those
extra taxes for climate change, is "Why is east Antarctica getting
colder?" It makes no sense at all if carbon dioxide is driving global
warming. While you're at it, you might inquire whether Gordon Brown
will give you a refund if it's confirmed that global warming has
stopped. The best measurements of global air temperatures come from
American weather satellites, and they show wobbles but no overall
change since 1999.

In just a couple of hours we'll be welcoming Monchis back to An 
Epiphany Of Sound.  When he was last on the show, the phones didn't seem 
to stop ringing.  So it was obvious everyone loved what he had to bring. 
I'm expecting more of the same this morning.  Something you don't want 
to miss!  So be sure and tune in; 90.1 FM in the SF Bay area and 
streaming to the world at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Talk to you soon!

: Yes, it's true.  An anti-gay property owner is
working very hard to close down both bars. You can
read the letter from the bar owners (below) in
response to this person's harassment. Please write an
email or attend these meetings or we will lose our
beloved SF Eagle tavern & The Hole in the Wall Bar!
Please don't let them do it!  Please take a moment to
act right now.

  ******letter from the owners:***** ****

Dear Friends of SOMA Gay Culture,

Hole In The Wall Saloon has become famous since it
opened some thirteen years ago. At the depth of the
AIDS epidemic, when gay South of Market seemed to be
dying, "The Hole" became a joyous retreat for our
community with an accent on art, fun, and music. A
thinking man's bar.

Anyway, the building where it lives now is rapidly
falling apart. For years we've been looking for a more
secure location, and in October of 2006 we bought a
suitable property on Folsom Street.

Shortly thereafter, a man named Jim Meko handed us a
letter. Allegedly, he had already delivered a copy to
the seller's realtor before we bought the property.
We'd never seen this letter. It stated that he and the
neighborhood did not want another bar in the South of
Market area (despite the fact that we had already been
here for twelve and a half years). So we held a
neighborhood meeting and presented our plans. We
assured everyone that we would address all concerns
with haste and sincerity. Still, Mr. Jim Meko
countered that if he stood at the intersection of 8th
and Folsom streets, he could hear loud music from
inside Hole In The Wall on any given night. He stated
that The Eagle Tavern, our second establishment (which
has been a gay bar for more than twenty-five years
now) was a terrible nuisance and that he was
constantly annoyed by the commotion from its Sunday
community benefits. He finally stood up and exclaimed
the following to our new neighbors: "Don't trust these
guys! They're bad bar owners!"

This last accusation cut the deepest. We've tried hard
over the years to be a positive force in our small
corner of the world. We clean and police the streets
in front of our establishments. We donate time, money,
and energy to charities and clubs that we see making a
difference. Most importantly, we respect our employees
as human beings with rights. Since the beginning,
we've provided them with health insurance, paid
vacations, and a yearly retreat at The Russian River.
Despite Mr. Jim Meko's characterization of it as a
nuisance, The Eagle Tavern raises tens of thousands of
dollars for charities and civic organizations each
year. Finally, we can't count how many gay men have
sworn they met their life partner at the Hole In The
Wall Saloon and consider it a sacred place. We're
proud of these things and believe ourselves to be far
from "bad bar owners".

We were soon informed that a hearing was being
insisted upon by a second neighbor at the urging of
Mr. Jim Meko and that others had now been persuaded to
oppose the bar's relocation project. We personally
called this second neighbor. He had never been to Hole
In The Wall. He had been to The Eagle Tavern once.

At this point, the future of the Hole In The Wall
looks grim. The floor and foundation are in bad shape.
The bar's days are numbered. We can't afford to
purchase another building; and in any case something
similar to all of this would be the certain outcome.
South of Market, in the hands of the small-minded, has
slowly turned petty and intolerant. Not only is Hole
In The Wall certain to close if we can't re-locate,
but the future of The Eagle is in doubt as well. Mr.
Jim Meko's main complaints were directed against it,
and he sits on the city's Entertainment Commission.

What we're asking for is your spiritual and verbal
support. We need testimony from people who know the
Hole In The Wall and The Eagle Tavern and consider
them important. Please send a short letter directly to

President Dwight Alexander
San Francisco Planning Department
1660 Mission St. 5th Floor
San Francisco, CA 94103

OR SEND AN EMAIL TO CHRIS DALY, DISTRICT SIX
SUPERVISOR, AT
chris.daly@sfgov. org

Your presence and willingness to speak for a minute or
two at our hearing on Thursday, May 10th beginning at
1:30 would be of immense help. It will be at City
Hall, Room 400. In any event, the destiny of both the
Hole In The Wall and The Eagle Tavern are up to their
fans now... As is the future and spirit of all of
South of Market.

Sincerely,

John Gardiner & Joseph Banks, Proprietors
Hole In The Wall Saloon & The Eagle Tavern

Yuri's Night Update **PLEASE READ!!**

*********
Hello Space Cadets!

The excitement 'round here could power a rocket ship, I swear. Yuri's  
Night Bay Area is almost upon us and everything has fallen into place  
wonderfully. Updated info is on the website, but there are a bunch of  
key pieces of information we'd like you all to know. Knowledge is  
power, we hope the info below helps everyone plan for a fun and safe  
evening. Okay, enough small talk...I know this may seem like a lot,  
but PLEASE read through this and pass along to your friends who might  
not have received this.

* First things first...Please arrive early! In addition to the  
incredible lineup of speakers and demos that will be on hand, you'll  
avoid the longer entrance lines. Join us for dinner if you like,  
we'll have organic food by the Convergence Cafe. Speakers and demos  
begin at 6:30 and our Keynote Speaker, Anousheh Ansari, will speak at  
7:30. And don't forget, Telefon Tel Aviv will start at 9:15 p.m.!
* On a similar note, Plaid will play from 11:45 pm until 1:15 a.m.  
Keep this in mind as you plan your evening...You can see a full  
schedule at www.worldspaceparty.com/schedule.php.
* Yuri's Night Bay Area is an 18+ event.
* Please remember, part of the magic of the evening is that this  
event is at NASA. We'd like to remind you all that you will be on  
Federal Property. Behavior that you might feel is appropriate at  
other events might not be appropriate here. Use your judgment, if in  
doubt, save it for another night. Here's a message from the folks at  
the NASA Ames facility, PLEASE take a look, http:// 
www.worldspaceparty.com/nasa_msg.php
* We might sell out! This is for real. It's looking more and more  
likely that we will sell out, actually, and possibly fairly early in  
the night. Make sure everyone in your group has purchased a ticket so  
that you can all join us. Online ticket sales will end at 4pm, the  
day of the event, April 13, 2007. Tickets *may* be available at our  
walk-in outlets in San Francisco, visit www.worldspaceparty.com/ 
tickets.php for more info.
* Tickets at the gate, if available, will be $42 or $40 if you pay cash.
* Stay informed! We'll keep the Yuri's Night Hotline updated with any  
news (including ticket availability). This number is 415.820.3954.
* Stay informed, second option! Tune into AM 1700 on your radio as  
you approach the event, we'll also have news there.
* Our box office will close at 2:00 a.m. You must arrive by then!
* No ins and outs. Sorry folks, there will be NO exceptions to this.
* We strongly encourage folks to carpool to the event and take public  
transportation. Carpools park free! There is a ride share forum and  
info on shuttles to and from Caltrain here: www.worldspaceparty.com/ 
travel.php
* No outside alcohol allowed inside the event. We'll be selling beer  
from Drakes Brewery, make sure to bring your ID.
* Bring some warm clothes, part of the event includes outside  
exploration and we'll have the big doors to the hangar open all night.
* Most of our vendors will be cash only. There will be ATMs onsite  
but you should plan on bringing however much cash you need to get you  
through the night.
* Please be respectful of the site and the crew and volunteers who  
have worked hard to make this happen. Please put your trash and  
recyclables where they belong. Respect the amazing art, science  
displays and decorations that will be at the event.
* If you need assistance or information at the event, please visit  
our information booth. It is located immediately on the right once  
you enter the event and will be staffed all night. This will also  
function as our lost and found.

We can't wait to see all of you! Yuri's Night Bay Area is now the  
world's largest Yuri's Night celebration, we're thrilled to be a part  
of it.

To infinity, and, of course, BEYOND.

Overandout,

Bay Area Yuri's Night Crew

Interesting coincidence there, as when I saw the London reference 
combined with the 23 reference I immediately thought of this group:
http://www.myspace.com/spiraltribe (aka the Network 23 Freeparty network

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  Help Save the SF Eagle Tavern & The Hole in the Wall bar

There was a discussion about this on another list I'm on, where Jim  
Meko personally responded-
I'm pasting the entire thread:

************************************************************************ 
*
again, apologies for keeping this on this list, but it started here,  
and i wanted to share jim meko's response to my letter. the entire  
thread is here, including his permission to share it. the map he  
attached showed a regular san francisco block, where the yards are  
all abutted in the back (one of which would belong to the bar who  
would want to/need to use it as a smoking patio), and which i am  
entirely certain are a haven of quiet for the people who live there.  
i can certainly understand why neighbors would object to putting a  
bar into that block which would have ongoing business in a back patio.

if someone would like that map, you can email me directly and i'll  
send it to you.

at any rate, i'm over and out about this one, i'm not really  
involved, but felt it was more expedient to just ask jim what was up  
with it.

  Hi Leslie,


  I have nothing against you sharing any of this. I'm not a liar and  
I have nothing to hide. Thanks for giving me a chance to tell my side  
of the story. Not many others have bothered to ask.

    jim,

    thanks for such a speedy and articulate reply. it makes total  
sense to me, in fact, i read all of the articles on your blog, and i  
am impressed at your clarity and how articulately you present your  
views. do you mind if i share this with the people having this  
discussion?or are there things in here that are premature to share?

    on its own, the map speaks volumes when you're talking about a  
place that would have its patio open to customers. i certainly would  
protest if that were going to happen in my neighborhood, even if, or  
maybe particularly if, i already had to deal with ongoing street  
action most of the time those peaceful backyard spaces truly should  
be protected.

      Leslie,


      There is an application for a change of use coming before the  
Planning Commission and several neighbors have filed an application  
asking that the Commission "take discretionary review." What I wrote  
was that I did not file the request for DR.


      There is also an application at the ABC to move the liquor  
license. I did write a protest letter but there would have been a  
hearing anyway.? John Gardiner was unwilling to make any  
accommodations for the neighbors so I put some pressure on him.


      I wrote that they would make horrible neighbors. Right now they  
have absolutely no residential neighbors and I don't give a flying  
fuck what they do over on 8th Street. I've stuck up for the bar  
against residents a block away more than a few times. But if the  
backyard at this new location is turned into a patio (which is their  
obvious intent), the noise from the crowds, the music, the events and  
all the smoke from the cigar (and pot) smokers would make life  
miserable for the people living in the dense residential cluster  
surrounding the bar. This is a rare residential enclave with  
backyards, lawns, gardens and trees. It's almost unique in South of  
Market.


      It reminds me of the argument used by the entertainment  
industry about people moving into an area without any sensitivity to  
what was there before. Only this time, the bar would be the newcomer.? 
The R's on the attached map all indicate peoples' homes.


      The Planning Department has no enforcement capabilities. The  
police regard noise and nuisance as their lowest priority. The bar  
doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the Entertainment Commission  
because they cannot qualify for a Place of Entertainment permit. I  
wish they did because then the Commission could ensure that they  
behave like good neighbors.


      The mitigations I've been negotiating with Jeremy would  
involved building a smoking room at the rear of the bar. With that,  
along with other sound attenuation measures, motorcycle parking  
accommodations and the addition of the good neighbor policy, if they  
agree to the plan the neighbors I've been meeting with are about  
ready to withdraw their DR request. Then I'd be willing to testify  
against the other DR filer and withdraw my ABC protest.


      I was a regular customer at the Hole for years. Some of their  
DJs play the music at unbelievably loud volumes. I complained a few  
times and they finally told me that if I didn't like it I should find  
another bar. That hasn't stopped me from working with Jeremy to find  
a compromise that allows them to make the move but it doesn't require  
that I consider them good neighbors.

        hi jim,
        ?
        remember me? from the san francisco late night coalition,  
though i've not been involved with them for several years now. but  
i'm still going out dancing a lot, and still very much care about  
keeping the city's nightlife alive.
        ?
        i wanted to write and ask what is up about the hole in the  
wall. one of the longtime members of a collective i've been involved  
with posted his concern about the situation to our email group, with  
his opinion that you were at the crux of the problems. it looks like  
you're taking some real heat about this. i looked at your blog and  
think it sounded entirely reasonable, and in my experience, i've  
known you to be a very direct guy, but consistent and fair. in your  
blog, you said you have not protested the move at all.
        ?
        now my friend has posted the blog response of patrock's live  
journal page, and on it he has a scan of the cover of a letter of  
protest that is signed by you that very specifically says that "while  
they know how to throw a great party, they would make horrible  
neighbors."
        ?
        so i'm writing to ask what the story is here. is there  
something i'm missing? for me, it's not abou the hole in the wall,  
really, since i'm not a customer there, and it's not likely i ever  
will be one ;^) -- my concern is that you are on the entertainment  
commission, and while that certainly doesn't mean you give up your  
rights as a neighbor to protest any business you want, it does seem  
that it holds you to a higher level of honesty in your dealings,  
particularly so when they have to do with entertainment. so seeing  
that letter definitely concerned me.
        ?
        is the letter real? did you in fact protest to the abc, but  
deny it later? hate to put you on the spot here, but i feel a need to  
ask the question.
        ?
        thanks for reading this, and i hope to hear back from you.
        ?

You'd think they'd integrate some sort of deal with Orbitz or somebody

Yuri's Night Update **PLEASE READ!!**

*********
Hello Space Cadets!

The excitement 'round here could power a rocket ship, I swear. Yuri's  
Night Bay Area is almost upon us and everything has fallen into place  
wonderfully. Updated info is on the website, but there are a bunch of  
key pieces of information we'd like you all to know. Knowledge is  
power, we hope the info below helps everyone plan for a fun and safe  
evening. Okay, enough small talk...I know this may seem like a lot,  
but PLEASE read through this and pass along to your friends who might  
not have received this.

* First things first...Please arrive early! In addition to the  
incredible lineup of speakers and demos that will be on hand, you'll  
avoid the longer entrance lines. Join us for dinner if you like,  
we'll have organic food by the Convergence Cafe. Speakers and demos  
begin at 6:30 and our Keynote Speaker, Anousheh Ansari, will speak at  
7:30. And don't forget, Telefon Tel Aviv will start at 9:15 p.m.!
* On a similar note, Plaid will play from 11:45 pm until 1:15 a.m.  
Keep this in mind as you plan your evening...You can see a full  
schedule at www.worldspaceparty.com/schedule.php.
* Yuri's Night Bay Area is an 18+ event.
* Please remember, part of the magic of the evening is that this  
event is at NASA. We'd like to remind you all that you will be on  
Federal Property. Behavior that you might feel is appropriate at  
other events might not be appropriate here. Use your judgment, if in  
doubt, save it for another night. Here's a message from the folks at  
the NASA Ames facility, PLEASE take a look, http:// 
www.worldspaceparty.com/nasa_msg.php
* We might sell out! This is for real. It's looking more and more  
likely that we will sell out, actually, and possibly fairly early in  
the night. Make sure everyone in your group has purchased a ticket so  
that you can all join us. Online ticket sales will end at 4pm, the  
day of the event, April 13, 2007. Tickets *may* be available at our  
walk-in outlets in San Francisco, visit www.worldspaceparty.com/ 
tickets.php for more info.
* Tickets at the gate, if available, will be $42 or $40 if you pay cash.
* Stay informed! We'll keep the Yuri's Night Hotline updated with any  
news (including ticket availability). This number is 415.820.3954.
* Stay informed, second option! Tune into AM 1700 on your radio as  
you approach the event, we'll also have news there.
* Our box office will close at 2:00 a.m. You must arrive by then!
* No ins and outs. Sorry folks, there will be NO exceptions to this.
* We strongly encourage folks to carpool to the event and take public  
transportation. Carpools park free! There is a ride share forum and  
info on shuttles to and from Caltrain here: www.worldspaceparty.com/ 
travel.php
* No outside alcohol allowed inside the event. We'll be selling beer  
from Drakes Brewery, make sure to bring your ID.
* Bring some warm clothes, part of the event includes outside  
exploration and we'll have the big doors to the hangar open all night.
* Most of our vendors will be cash only. There will be ATMs onsite  
but you should plan on bringing however much cash you need to get you  
through the night.
* Please be respectful of the site and the crew and volunteers who  
have worked hard to make this happen. Please put your trash and  
recyclables where they belong. Respect the amazing art, science  
displays and decorations that will be at the event.
* If you need assistance or information at the event, please visit  
our information booth. It is located immediately on the right once  
you enter the event and will be staffed all night. This will also  
function as our lost and found.

We can't wait to see all of you! Yuri's Night Bay Area is now the  
world's largest Yuri's Night celebration, we're thrilled to be a part  
of it.

To infinity, and, of course, BEYOND.

Overandout,

Bay Area Yuri's Night Crew

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Free ravers! Please take home! (i.e. chel-c and sean seek housing...)

Greetings!

Sean and Chelsea are seeking a raver-friendly household to move in to 
sometime after May 1... After reading "NO COUPLES, NO PARTIES, NO DRUGS, 
NO PETS" so many times, I thought maybe I might send my request out to 
you, my fellow party kids and party kids in recovery.  We are friendly 
and fun, and definitely not quiet ("woom-woom-woom-woom"), and are not 
interested in living with the legions of full-time-no-life office 
workers that have rooms open on craigslist.   Anyone starting a 
warehouse collective living situation any time soon...?  See here about 
us : 

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sha/311603364.html


Thanks, thanks, & thank you,

Love Chelsea & Sean


P.S. Liking techno is a major plus !

It was a really interesting party. After spending 48 hours at the space 
(setup/strike) I still never got over the fact it was in a hangar at a 
military base. It was cool and weird at the same time.

I'm sure people's perspective of this event will vary, I heard there were 
major logistical problems, especially with the ticketing, getting people 
on base to the party, and huge lines with a shortage of alcohol. 
Thankfully we smuggled in a handle of Skyy, which we shared and was gone 
by 1am. In general there was an apparent level of disorganization, with a 
motley crew of organizers compounded with NASA logistics and red tape. The 
hearts of most involved were in the right place though, imho.

Production value was really incredible. The theme was definitely 
super-spacey, the place was decked out and hooked up. We put up 14 big 
video screens, 8 were used for science exhibits in 3 geo-domes, the rest 
were a number of VJ setups. Rabbit in the Moon shot 7 projectors around an 
aircraft on the tarmac, which is something I've never seen before.

They would alternate NASA speakers and downtempo-ish music, the speakers 
were generally dry, although I perked up at one guy talking about the 
potential on colonizing Mars.

There were lots of Battlebots, art cars, glowing stuff, bikes, Burning Man 
stuff. Again, very weird to see this setting in the middle of Moffett 
Field. The Moffet/NASA people I spoke with were pretty supportive all the 
way, although I felt the air of uneasiness over the whole thing. There 
were special ops on the rooftops and ledges with binoculars the whole 
time. Not sure if there were any altercations.

The party ended about 1.5 hours early, around 4:30am. The excuse given was 
a bit suspicious (impending rain).

Overall a very cool event, something I'll remember and look back on. Great 
crowd and got to see a bunch of familiar faces :-)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Are mobile phones wiping out our bees? 

  http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece

Are mobile phones wiping out our bees?
Scientists claim radiation from handsets are to blame for mysterious  
'colony collapse' of bees
By Geoffrey Lean and Harriet Shawcross
Published: 15 April 2007

It seems like the plot of a particularly far-fetched horror film. But  
some scientists suggest that our love of the mobile phone could cause  
massive food shortages, as the world's harvests fail.

They are putting forward the theory that radiation given off by  
mobile phones and other hi-tech gadgets is a possible answer to one  
of the more bizarre mysteries ever to happen in the natural world -  
the abrupt disappearance of the bees that pollinate crops. Late last  
week, some bee-keepers claimed that the phenomenon - which started in  
the US, then spread to continental Europe - was beginning to hit  
Britain as well.

The theory is that radiation from mobile phones interferes with bees'  
navigation systems, preventing the famously homeloving species from  
finding their way back to their hives. Improbable as it may seem,  
there is now evidence to back this up.

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) occurs when a hive's inhabitants  
suddenly disappear, leaving only queens, eggs and a few immature  
workers, like so many apian Mary Celestes. The vanished bees are  
never found, but thought to die singly far from home. The parasites,  
wildlife and other bees that normally raid the honey and pollen left  
behind when a colony dies, refuse to go anywhere near the abandoned  
hives.

The alarm was first sounded last autumn, but has now hit half of all  
American states. The West Coast is thought to have lost 60 per cent  
of its commercial bee population, with 70 per cent missing on the  
East Coast.

CCD has since spread to Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Italy  
and Greece. And last week John Chapple, one of London's biggest bee- 
keepers, announced that 23 of his 40 hives have been abruptly abandoned.

Other apiarists have recorded losses in Scotland, Wales and north- 
west England, but the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural  
Affairs insisted: "There is absolutely no evidence of CCD in the UK."

The implications of the spread are alarming. Most of the world's  
crops depend on pollination by bees. Albert Einstein once said that  
if the bees disappeared, "man would have only four years of life left".

No one knows why it is happening. Theories involving mites,  
pesticides, global warming and GM crops have been proposed, but all  
have drawbacks.

German research has long shown that bees' behaviour changes near  
power lines.

Now a limited study at Landau University has found that bees refuse  
to return to their hives when mobile phones are placed nearby. Dr  
Jochen Kuhn, who carried it out, said this could provide a "hint" to  
a possible cause.

Dr George Carlo, who headed a massive study by the US government and  
mobile phone industry of hazards from mobiles in the Nineties, said:  
"I am convinced the possibility is real."

The case against handsets

Evidence of dangers to people from mobile phones is increasing. But  
proof is still lacking, largely because many of the biggest perils,  
such as cancer, take decades to show up.

Most research on cancer has so far proved inconclusive. But an  
official Finnish study found that people who used the phones for more  
than 10 years were 40 per cent more likely to get a brain tumour on  
the same side as they held the handset.

Equally alarming, blue-chip Swedish research revealed that radiation  
from mobile phones killed off brain cells, suggesting that today's  
teenagers could go senile in the prime of their lives.

Studies in India and the US have raised the possibility that men who  
use mobile phones heavily have reduced sperm counts. And, more  
prosaically, doctors have identified the condition of "text thumb", a  
form of RSI from constant texting.

Professor Sir William Stewart, who has headed two official inquiries,  
warned that children under eight should not use mobiles and made a  
series of safety recommendations, largely ignored by ministers.

TECHNO, BREAKS & MORE:

Heather Heart
(Sonic Groove / East Music Group)

One of the better known techno DJs, Heather has been traveling the country 
promoting her diverse styles for over a decade.
Featured in such publications as Paper, Billboard, New York, XLR8R, 
FrontPage, Village Voice and Jane, her work has been recognized for her 
captivating style and contributions to the advancements of electronica.The 
world renowned record shop SONIC GROOVE was born through the collaborations 
of Heather, Frankie Bones and Adam X, and continues to push the boundaries.

DDR *live
(Stay Up Forever / Cluster / Smitten / Routemaster)

A veteran of the London underground dance scene since 1990, DDR has 
unleashed his own brand of techno-trance on many labels and at many parties, 
raves, clubs & festivals around the globe. A pioneer of what was to become 
the London Acid Techno sound, DDR was the first guest producer to appear on 
Stay Up Forever after a meeting of minds with the then newly created 
Liberator DJ trio, he has had a hand in many of their most memorable 
releases and is one of their most prolific artists to date.

Praxis
(Omniscient Records)

During the first years of his professional DJ career, PRAXIS played sets 
comprised of hard, acid techno that aimed to take their listeners on a 
journey through astral dimensions.
Josh's techno influences broadened and he soon was spinning harder, darker 
and intensly driving. Although, nowadays you may find him spinning anything 
from hard tribal techno to funky drummy tech-house or even psychedelic 
tech-trance. With seven years of djing under his belt, Josh has spun out at 
events all over the Bay Area and rocked them all.

Mario Bros
(OtherWorld / 00bliss.com / TechFunk Alliance / Ill Behavior / The 
MidnightSons)

What can we say about these guys? They're fucking awesome!
The Mario Bros. is made up of one part "daniella downs", one part "Marc(O)" 
and a whole lot of pimp juice. They are best served straight up in a 
highball glass...



JUNGLE, HIP-HOP, DUB & MORE:

Filastine *live
(Soot Records / Post World Industries / Shockout)

Filastine creates music and live sets that wreck genre, charting a new sonic 
map by synchronizing mutated hiphop, smashed-up beats, and international 
obscura.For the last two years Filastine has brought his soundclash to 
clubs, squats, festivals, and underground spaces across the globe, peforming 
with laptop, midi triggers, loudspeaker, and percussion mounted on a 
shopping cart, sometimes joined by a guest mc or vocalist.This year 
Filastine dropped Burn It on dj/Rupture's Soot Records.

Marc Stretch
(Legionnaire Crew / Vinyl Bros / Bronx Boy)

Born in the South, bred in the East, and residing in the West, Stretch is a 
living example of our musical culture today.
A complete combination of styles, flavors, and influences. Whether as an 
Emcee (Foreign Legion, Marval Team Up, Kid Guch) or as a DJ (Vinyl Bros), 
party rockin' is job one and he does it with the passion of a rookie and the 
swagger of a vet. Put on your dancing shoes, grab a rain-suit and a spatula, 
and call your job and let 'em know that you won't be in tomorrow.

Method One
(Levitated Recordings / method-one.com / Covert Operations)

In the 13 years since he first started experimenting with sampled loops, 
Method One has become one of the elder statesmen of the American drum & bass 
scene. As a dj, he has honed his craft through hundreds of gigs stretching 
back to the early nineties. As a promoter, he helped to throw some of the 
first raves and jungle events in the East Coast's Mid-Atlantic region. And, 
as a musician, he is responsible for numerous releases on labels such as 
Nexus (Good Looking), Dune Recordings, True Intent and Elite Recordings, as 
well as producing remixes for the the likes of Deee-Lite.


Spukkin Faceship *live
(SPAZ)

I've been performing and recording electronic beats and experimental sound 
since 1992. I live in a bus and often travel with a soundsystem collective 
known as S.P.A.Z.. I play at mostly underground and free events all over the 
world. I've released music on several different independent labels over the 
years including Visible,Weird Dream,Digi-Dub,Shakti Science,Studio !K7,IOT, 
as well as a few self-produced vinyl releases and cassettes. My preferred 
venue is anyplace that is beyond the control of the forces of external 
government and conformity, as well as the bounds of good taste.

Electronic music pretty much sucks without e.

well Pink Floyd uses a lot of samples and electronics, though they're not
really classified as "electronic music."  I loved them and a lot of other
electronic tinged bands for a long time, but I'd have to say that the first
time I heard EDM and said "wow that kicks ass" was hearing Sasha's San
Francisco Global Underground and Hybrid's album "Wide Angle" in the same
night right around when they first came out.  As they say, the rest is
history...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] My question for the day: 

I never got into the 'mainstream' edm until the late 90s. The music I loved
as a young'n was video game music. Most had no vocals, melodies tied
together for one endless song and most had that upbeat electronic dance
quality to it.

I use to record my video game session (minus the sound f/x) music to a tape
and took it to listen to at school. It would confuse everyone else but for
me its what hit closest to the heart.

>From there Oakenfold (yes I know most of you hate him) opened me up to EDM
with his 'Resident' album. Trance led me to house and other fun edm forms
and have enjoyed it ever since. The Alternative/Grunge mid-90s period was
the last time I actually purchased a popular music CD. My fav alternative
band was the Stone Temple Pilots...like early Coltrane, Scott Wieland did
his best work high as a kite. No junk, no soul right? (That includes you
also Chevy Chase!)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] My question for the day:

Dear god!!!

I saw Bjork play with the Sugarcubes in '87 w/ New Order & PIL. I was 
already like 13 years old by then. Eep.

But, my moms and pops got me into muisc by way of me hearing all their 50's 
& 60's stuff. All dance muisc I might add (I guess they both used to do some 
heavy duty swing-dancing back in the day, which ,if you knew my parents 
would be most amusing to you). Then of course being born when disco was 
breaking probably had some influence as well.

I think the only reason my folks have been supportive of my DJing or 
anything is because they like the idea of people gettin' their groove on en 
masse.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] My question for the day:

Heh- I can pinpoint it exactly-

Imagine me, 18yo, living at mom's, 2AM sitting in the dark, staring  
at a 32" TV playing Tempest 2000 on the Atari Jaguar.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_2000

The synergy of the senses attained has only been matched by sex while  
listening to Gintas K.

To add to the gravity of the situation- I had purchased Daft Punk's  
OG album, then returned it- only to buy it again and upgrade my subs.

I still bust the Jaguar out from time to time for an old-school  
getdown...

My Treo died last saturday, and I didn't have my contacts synched 
correctly so I pretty much lost all of them.

So, if you would like me to have your contact info, please send me digits 
so I can put 'em in my new phone.

Thanks!

 Petition is:http://...com/2u7ghcFDA Attacks Complementary and Alternative =
Health Care(Posted by: "John Gilbert" _drjohngilbert@charter.net _I just sp=
ent three days reading, re-reading, researching and discussing the proposed=
 FDA guidelines for "Complementary and Alternative Medicine" with two FDA a=
ttorneys. You can download a copy of this proposal for yourself at: _http:/=
/www.fda.http://wwwhttp://www.fda.http://www.fda.http_(http://www.fda.gov/o=
hrms/dockets/dockets/06d0480/06d0480.htm.)When I first heard about this FDA=
 attack on complementary and alternative health care, I considered it anoth=
er "Chicken Little" rumor. On further study, I'm appalled at the speed with=
 which the pharmaceutical companies are implementing Codex Alimentarius in =
the USA. If you don't suspect the pharmaceutical companies control the FDA,=
 you may want to research that further by visiting _http://www.HealthFrhttp=
://wwhttp_ (http://www.healthfreedomusa.org./)This insidious proposal is de=
signed to redefine every complementary and alternative health care modality=
 and product as "medicine." This has direct implications on the services an=
d products provided by every alternative health care professional. There is=
 no facet of complementary and alternative health care that is not affected=
. If the FDA adopts this proposal, all natural health care would be illegal=
 even for medical doctors.Essential oils, herbs, herbal remedies, homeopath=
ic remedies, minerals, nutritional supplements, plant enzymes and vitamins =
are redefined in this proposal as "medicine." Very simply, medicine is unde=
r the jurisdiction of the FDA and, by law, only licensed medical doctors ma=
y prescribe "medicines." Anybody else who advises,advocates, counsels, dist=
ributes, markets, recommends or suggestsanybody use "medicine" is practicin=
g medicine without a license. This is a felony in the USA punishable by fin=
es and incarceration.Aromatherapy, auricular therapy, biofeedback, color th=
erapy, homeopathy, hypnotism, naturopathy, neurotherapy, nutritional consul=
ting, reflexology, sound therapy and wellness consulting are among the alte=
rnative health modalities being redefined as "Alternative Medicine." This s=
ubtle change of vocabulary from "alternative health care" to "alternative m=
edicine" makes all of these industries subject to control by the FDA as med=
icine. Only medical doctors would be allowed to provide, prescribe and supe=
rvise the delivery of these services. Anybody else who provided any of thes=
e services would be practicing medicine without a license and subject to in=
carceration and fines.That's the bad news. The good news is we have until A=
pril 30, 2007 to voice our opinion against this proposal to eliminate compl=
ementary and alternative health care in America. Almost 100,000people have =
already filed their objection. According to Dr. Rima Laibow, medical direct=
or of the Natural Therapies Foundation, we need 50 times that many people t=
o respond by the end of the month.Please stand up and be counted. Go to _ht=

 of natural health care, in support of complementary and alternative health=

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hi all,

I'm selling my Macbook Pro for $1800 and would like to have it go to someone here rather than someone on Craigslist.

Specs:

   2.16GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
   1440 x 900 pixels (15" screen)

   2GB memory
   120GB hard drive1
   6x double-layer SuperDrive
   ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics with 128MB SDRAM

I bought it about 3 months ago and don't use it nearly as much as I'd like.  It's the $1999 version with an additional gig of memory.  It has a lot of software on it currently (MS Office, Logic Express, Final Cut Pro, etc, etc) but I can wipe it clean for you if you'd prefer that.  Basically, you'd be saving about $500 compared to what you'd pay in the store.

No bad pixels, original box, etc, etc.

Thanks,
Phillip

Everybody's asking what's next?  Get ready for the next throwdown in this

parties continue showcase talent flown in from out of town as well as some
of your favorite local house jocks. We look forward to continuing to bring
you high quality events, so strap on your dancing shoes, bring everybody you

Matt e Starr (Portland Housing Authority, Portland OR)

Mr. Starr is Portland's secret weapon!  Matt e's weekly afterhours party has
brought some of the biggest and best dj's in house music to Portland.   As a
DJ, Matt e has kept them dancing all over Portland, Oregon -- in nightclubs,
ballrooms, basements, lofts, warehouses, hotel suites, and in the great
outdoors. Having made his public debut at Burning Man 2001, Matt e travels
far and wide with his vinyl, having many opportunities to represent
Portland's House community while entertaining diverse audiences in
California, Washington, Nevada, and Canada.  Don't miss this exclusive
appearance at Tonal!

Marcus Jerard (Jack Attack, Kolony, Endup)--Happy Birthday!

A veteran of the SF scene, Marcus Jerard throws down like it's nobody's
business.  Hearing his sound and his mixing style, one would swear he's from
Chicago.  Marcus moves deftly through jackin' beats, acid tracks, and
anything else that will cause dancefloor freakouts.  His Jack Attack parties
brought us standout dj's such as Derrick Carter, Justin Long, John Larner,
and many more.  We are thrilled that Mr. Jerard has decided to celebrate his
birthday with us...get ready to jack your body! 

Rouzbeh (Back2Basics)

Holding it down on the funkier side of things for the Back 2 Basics crew,
Rouzbeh combines excellent track selection and mixing skills with the kind
of energy that makes you put your hands in the air and stomp your feet to

Generals, and Derrick May (who incidentally made an appearance at our Tonal:
Fire Engine Red party after playing Back 2 Basics) to name a few.  Something
tells us you're going to need yoga the next day... 

Eric Sharp (Rock It Science) vs. Shrimp (Dustfish, Joint Effort)

If you happened to stumble into Anon Salon on March 24, you may have
witnessed Eric jumping on the decks impromptu with Shrimp as part of his
unending birthday celebration.  The madness that ensued on the dancefloor
could not be contained to one night, so we're getting these loons back
together for a 2 and 1/2 hour opening set, setting the shenanigans just
right.  Get there early in order to not miss this tag team action! 

Andrew Phelan & Origami (Prismatic, So Sound, Drop Music)

Andrew and Origami are blowing up on the production tip, with recent
signings of their tracks on some hot new mix compilations as well as their
upcoming EP on the one of the UK's pinnacle labels: Drop Music.  Andrew's
grooves and precise mixing combined with Origami's uber funky live bass
stylings are going to close the night out proper this time, taking us in for
the perfect landing.  Woot! 

Rob Crush (Crush Collective)

Aptly named, Mr. Crush will be leaving some squished bodies on the
dancefloor.  Hate to say we told you so, but even in the time since Rob's
first appearance for us he has already shared the decks with Stompy's Deron
and Om's Troydon at Minx, one of SF's most solid weeklies on Thursdays at
Endup.  Prepare yourself for some hot new cuts, as we're sure Rob's Miami
WMC trip yielded some serious results...

These look fun!   I hope you keep doing these into the fall so I'll be able to get to one of these color parties.  I'm pretty sure I have an outfit for any color you've got.  

Also, I heard your mix on XM radio again the other day...congrats on that too!

All the Tonal parties I've been to thus far have been awesome.  I loved the
house where the last one was held, really great place for a party.  Time to
start convincing my friends to come to this instead of paying too much money
to see Paul Van Dyk.

Subject: [sfraves] Re:[sfraves] BSP Evocation - Opulent Temple @ Porn Palace

Saturday, April 21st 10pm-5am
21+

Opulent Temple presents it 5th Year of providing music with a message - 
"Dance your ass off !"


"Evocation"

The Opulent Temple has shown up big for BRC going on 5 years in a row now 
with the most diverse line ups of world class talent the playa has ever 
seen. Tiesto, Stanton Warriors, Paul Oakenfold, Lee Coombs, DJ Dan, Hybrid, 
Sandra Collins, D:Fuse, The Scumfrog, Freq Nasty, Tipper, Josh Gabriel (of 
Gabriel & Dresden), Bassnectar (Lorin) and others are among them. We will be 
back in ‘07 with our biggest and most ambitious projects to date, continuing 
to create a space for sacred dance and peak experience for the community.

Unlike many funded art projects, like all Large Scale Sound & Art Camps, we 
get ZERO financial support from Burning Man of any kind. We are totally 
reliant on the support of the SF dance community and camp members paying 
dues to bring you the joy that is a big reason why a lot of us go to Burning 
Man and have the amazing experiences that we do. Please come out in support 
of our efforts, with a diverse line up of kick ass talent on the cheap. Come 
be a part of the evocation.

With

Carbon Community (Sober Music / Bless, Dallas TX)
Dutch (Thump / Opulent Temple)

Room for rent in South Berkeley - Available immediately

About the room & house:

11' x 10' room in a 3 BR/1 BA 1st-floor flat. Rent is $600/month + a  
share of utilities & DSL plus shared consumables like toilet paper,  
coffee, sugar, etc. Deposit $600

If you would like to share meals with us (we both cook a LOT and are  
really good at it), we can figure out a food budget.

The house is a duplex, and was purchased in January with our friend  
Cindy (aka Puddin') who will be moving in upstairs after the tenants  
move out. Our intent is to have some shared meals (mostly dinner and  
brunch) in our big kitchen downstairs, and use one of the rooms  
upstairs as a sewing/craft room.

There are small front and back yards. Front yard has wrought iron  
fence and will be planted with apple trees and other food and  
insectary crops. A koi pond and wood-burning cob oven are planned for  
the back yard, as well as more fruit
and nut trees.

Living room has surround sound and HD flat screen for movies and  
occasional TV; Kitchen is huge, and has just about everything you  
could want if you like to cook - stand mixer, food processor, big  
pressure cooker, dish washer, and more; Wireless and in-room ethernet  
connection; Washer & Dryer; Whole house water filtration will be  
installed soon

lunch) is around the corner on Adeline

Bicycle: Berkeley is GREAT for getting around by bicycle, and we are  
right next to one of the "Bicycle Boulevards" that crisscross the city

Driving: lots of on-street parking; equidistant from I-80 (Ashby  
exit) and CA24 (MLK/51st St. exit)


About you:

We want to create a cohesive community within our building, and  
prefer someone who will become a part of it, not just "rent a room".  
Please be mature and responsible, but not uptight - Sense of humor is  
a must!

This would be a good place for Burning Man/raver/artist/creative  
people, especially if you are into ecological design, architecture,  
photography, permacuture, fashion design, or music.

This is a great situation if you are looking for a stable place to  
live with an interest in community-style living.


If you are interested:

Please email us and tell us a bit about yourself, any questions you  
might have, and times/days when we can meet with you.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: 5/19/07 : Ignition @ The Garage (Sac) w/ Simply Jeff, Mario Bros +

StrategiK Events present: IGNITION @ The Capitol Garage (Sacramento, CA)

Your headliner for the evening:

Simply Jeff
Dj Culture/Phonomental Music / www.simplyjeff.com / XM Radio

Jeff is a 3rd generation Japanese California native who started playing 
records at an early age for High School dances to private events in the 80s. 
Anything from cuttng edge Electro dance beats, early Hip Hop, New 
Wave/Gothic to Top 40 dance music was the main formula of his musical 
strength. Jeff's early versatility to dance music lead him to perform in 
local nightclubs and radio mix shows. After graduating from The University 
of Sound Arts for video sweetening and music production. Jeff attended 
extention courses at UCLA for music business and marketing. During this time 
Jeff was also interning at Capital Records, Cema Distribution and at the 
World Famous KROQ FM in Burbank, California. At KROQ, Jeff (known as Spinn 
at the time) was able to use his production knowledge and made special 
mega-mixes for artist such as Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, EMF, Jesus Jones 
to Erasure. After KROQ, it was MARS FM in 1991 that spawn Jeff on the FM air 
waves as regular on-air personality. MARS FM (based in Santa Monica, 
California) was the first 24/7 Electronic Dance Station in the Nation. Jeff 
known as DJ Spinn, hit the FM air-waves every Saturday afternoon with 
Swedish Eagle on the Mars FM Top 30 Countdown Mix Show. At this time, Jeff 
also released his first recorded works on vinyl out of the trunk of his car 
to promote himself as an artist and DJ. Sometime after....Jeff signed his 
first record deal and started touring across Mother Earth.
Today the name SIMPLY JEFF is known across the globe for supporting the 
music he loves the most by being on top of his tour schedule, working at his 
record shop "DJ CULTURE" in Huntington Beach, his Pod-cast / streaming radio 
show appropriately called..."THE MIX SHOW ON DJCULTURE DOT COM" with the 
funny, slurry and sometimes witty co-hosts... Bryan Mizota and Rich (we like 
to call him "Shure, Shure"). Jeff also finds time to support his music 
productions by running the Phonomental Music label based out of Newport 
Beach, California

with special guests:

The Mario Bros.

Daniella Downs
Essential Breaks West / TechFunk Alliance / Mario Bros, SF
&
Marc(O)
The MidnightSons / OtherWorld / Mario Bros, SF

What can we say about these guys? They're fucking awesome! The Mario Bros. 
is made up of one part "daniella downs", one part "Marc(O)" and a whole lot 
of pimp juice. They are best served straight up in a highball glass...

Subject: [sfraves] great downtempo mix

Nick Warren - Global Underground #30 - Paris

it's a 2-disc set: Disc 2 is a so-so progressive mix... it's alright,  
i guess.  Disc 1, however, is one of the best downtempo mixes i've  
heard in a long time. I'm really digging it.

i got it from Beatport.com; Trackitdown.net also has it.

progressive. Disc 2 downtempo esque very nice.

Is there any way to buy the tickets at the box office before the event? I don't use credit cards and I haven't seen Richie Hawtin since Nocturnal Wonderland 2000,  he (and Dave Clarke & Ricardo Villalobos) I follow religiously, fiending for there  next intenet posted set. I think if I were to miss richie hawting (because I hate the slavery potential of credit cards) would almost make me fell like less of a techno head.

our little BBQ.
So if you have any meats, or anything you want bbq'd up, you should
definetely bring
'em, as well as condiments or whatever else. Music will be going
inside from 3pm-8pm
and the bar will be open for your drinking pleasure. And yes, we're
still doing it

I miss the crepe truck near studio Z. Is it still there? I heard they
were going to pull out of the spot. If that isn't around anymore, you
could make a killing off of 4am crepes. mmm. savory.

I got this from the episode "Hearts and Minds".  It's a kick ass
episode, I'm really surprised I didn't catch this series sooner, it
ran from like '96 to '03 or something like that, and I think it's
quality television.  Notice I said quality "television".

Subject: [sfraves] OW 420 Party Review

We had a great time at the OW 420 party last Friday night!
 
This was my first time at OW and I was impressed.  The venue looked great and is just an amazing space.  For this party there were two rooms plus a chill area.  The first room was all trance/breaks/techno and the other room was jungle/DnB.  
 
I managed to drag two of my friends along with me, Mark and Doug.  We started the evening off at Doug's apartment in Oakland, had a few cocktails, and played some records.  Doug introduced me to the DFA remixes which were some pretty nice house.  Check them out if you are into house.  I explained my definition of "bitch ass" house music to Doug who plays similar stuff to me.  After a bit it was time to head over to the party.

Drove over the shuttle stop, imediately found safe parking, and the shuttle was there waiting for us.  The logistics were smooth and easy and the shuttle was safe except for the music.  Journey?  Eeek!

We arrived at OW I'm guessing about 1/2 way into the Mario Brother's set.  Some funky ass breaks which was a good way to start the evening out, especially since Doug is more of a funky SF house head.  Hanging over the front room was a giant joint that lit up and blew smoke from time to time.  All the lights and decor were pretty good.
 
Nice and funky!  And did I hear some house in this set?  I'm not sure now.  I could feel the funk and even a touch of soul in the Mario Borthers set.  I wish this set had started just a tad later.  Anyway we were getting in the groove as Marc(o) and Daniella Downs dropped the beats and we began to celebrate the occasion.   

Heather Heart came on and was playing some really nice techno.  Things were just getting going when she lost her sound.  Arrgh!  It was only for a moment but the energy dissipated quickly.  I'm not a hardcore techno head, but I do like good techno and I liked most of her set.  Was that Green Velvet's La La Land in there?  It sounded almost a sing a long song for a techno set and so we sang along ;)  

Doug faded early.  A little too much enjoyment of the holiday I guess.  But Mark and I were just gettign started.  
 
The techno started to get a bit too aggresive for us, so we headed over to the jungle area just in time to catch Filastine's set.  Wow!   Now I'm not really a Jungle head, but this was the high point of the evening for me as Filastine wove together ragga and jungle and gypsy chants and other sonic bits and pieces in layers spinning and twisting over one another.  I was impressed with a lot of this music and the lights and decor in the jungle area was a perfect compliment to Filastine's beats.  Especially the spinny light ball thing.  

I had trouble even categorizing the music he played at the time.  As soon as I thought it was jungle it would spin out into a ragga riff or some exotic chanting or gypsy tune would take over.  Thank's to Marc(o) for reminding me that this is a good thing.  I'm going to be paying more attention to the jungle and keeping my ears out for more from Filastine.  

Filastine was followed by a hip-hop DJ who I didn't dig that much although he played some good tracks.  Some "questionable" mixes IMO however.

So we headed back out to the other room for some trance room for some solid trance tracks (delivered by DDR I guess.)  What was that track with the lyric "You've got to lick it before you dick it" ? Ha ha!  That was some bitch ass trance!  I didn't know there was such a thing.

I really enjoyed myself, the logistics were flawless, and the beats were solid.  I met some nice folks althoguh I didn't do much dancing.  I'm looking forward to my next chance to go to a party at OW.  My only complaint was the harsh flourescent lighting near the bathroom area.  I don't think anyone looks good in that light, and I know I don't for sure!  

Around 4AM it was time to go...I made it back home safely, but I'm still pretty tired.  

Peace,

Peter

Pink's is the JAM!

Ben's Chili Bowl in DC is kick ass too for after hours grubbage post 
clubbing.

Here in SF...

There's also a Korean BBQ on Geary that's open til 4am as well.

I always liked the thai place (Toi I think it is called) on Sunset that's open till 4AM myself.  I've eaten at Pinks exactly twice and both times I had to run not walk to the bathroom.  Never again.  

Canter's is good, one of my favorites, though I used to live a lot closer to Junior's which is also good if it still exists.  Junior's does great breakfasts.

Here in SF I've gone usually gone home or back when I was single sometimes El Faralito.  Growing up in Berkeley one of our favorite places most popular place was Top Dog which is still around (http://www.topdoghotdogs.com/).

But my favorite after party spot worldwide is without a doubt the La Sandwhicherie in South Beach Miami (http://www.lasandwicherie.com/)

there's still nothing like pink's hot dogs on la brea at 3am, or
canters deli (24 hours) on fairfax...

that is, of course, if you're in la.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] OW 420 Party Review

Thanks for having me at your party Mike.  We had a great time and I look forward to coming to OW again.

Some folks wrote me to say I shouldn't have posted the review even after the fact, bc the party was on the super duper down low, so I hope I didn't cause you all any difficulties by posting this.  I never post party locations or info lines for undergrounds of course, but I figured it was OK to write a review after the party was over.  I hope this isn't a problem and I'll be more cautious in the future.

Peace,

Peter

===========================================================

Filter.SF.1.1 with Fumiya Tanaka (Op.Disc,Tresor, Torema) -all night dance event

Featuring: Compression LA's Luis Rosario and Bay Area Beatdrop
residents: Saya, Solekandi + Kontakt

Visuals by new media artist Mike Creighton (Alphahouse/St.Louis)

April 28, 2007
Fat City
314 11th St (Folsom), SF
10 PM to 8 AM


What to expect from this techno veteran?

If you've been following Fumiya's work for the past decade, you're
likely familiar with his recordings "I am not a DJ" and "Unknown
Possibility" that defined his signature crisp sound and earned him a
reputation as one of the world's top techno DJs.

Fumiya is set to take the world's stage again with a new sound that
fully explores the edges of percussive-based minimalist techno. His
new label Op.Disc, run in conjunction with Radiq, delivers full
frontal audio pleasure with a texture-heavy, tribal-dipped,
bass-ripping tour with unconvential touches such as broken samples and
dubbed-out vocals.

Material from his Dartriix project can be found here: myspace.com/opdisctokyo
Video and Fumiya Tanaka DJ mixes at: myspace.com/filtersf

 performance this weekend (LA/SF)


FUCKING SICK.  Been waiting about ten years for this guy.  He started out 
a totally freaky Tokyo based Jeff Mills clone and the last couple sets of 
his I've checked out on line seem to indicate he's getting past just 
hotmixing 3decks of detroit drum bangers and expanding his style a bit in 
a unique direction.  I have nothing to do with this promoter, etc, and 
can't vouch for shit (see my Jeff Mills review from a few month back if 
you wanna know what I mean) but... Most likely DOPE ASS TECHNO ACTION 
[tm].

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Old rave literature


I wrote one of those that we handed out a Harmony's "A Wrinkle in Time" (I 
believe this predated Dancesafe and all that stuff, I think they might 
have actually asked me about using some of the wording on there on some of 
their early materials).  The point was to get people to increase the 
amount of thought they put into making the rave and underground community 
safer, and more sustainable by increasing knowledge and community 
responsibility... through drug & risk awareness, being aware of resources 
like mental health counseling, youth support, sites like erowid & 
hyperreal, supporting events that had the best of the community in mind 
(no $2-3 water, adequate ventilation and access to medial resources), etc.

I remember a kid saying "oh, ok mom" as I handed him one, we almost had to 
call the paramedics on his ass a couple hours later.  GHB was the headache 
drug of the underground and we thought the hammer was coming down any 
minute.  Little did we realize it would expand manyfold before caving in 
under the pressure of corporate greed, lack of genuine promoter passion 
and forgetting to listen to how great the music was on the way to buy that 
hit.

I still love everything I loved back then, but the world has changed. It's 
gloomy tuesday forever and you're all shit.  *cries all over his "RAVE" 
detergent shirt, JNCOs and candy beads*

I've always been a big fan of sf's donut shops - they could do a killing if they started selling hot dogs after 3.

dangrsmind@yahoo.com wrote: I always liked the thai place (Toi I think it is called) on Sunset that's open till 4AM myself.  I've eaten at Pinks exactly twice and both times I had to run not walk to the bathroom.  Never again.  

Canter's is good, one of my favorites, though I used to live a lot closer to Junior's which is also good if it still exists.  Junior's does great breakfasts.

Here in SF I've gone usually gone home or back when I was single sometimes El Faralito.  Growing up in Berkeley one of our favorite places most popular place was Top Dog which is still around (http://www.topdoghotdogs.com/).

But my favorite after party spot worldwide is without a doubt the La Sandwhicherie in South Beach Miami (http://www.lasandwicherie.com/)

there's still nothing like pink's hot dogs on la brea at 3am, or

that is, of course, if you're in la.

Canter's is good, one of my favorites, though I used to live a lot closer to Junior's which is also good if it still exists.  Junior's does great breakfasts.

Here in SF I've gone usually gone home or back when I was single sometimes El Faralito.  Growing up in Berkeley one of our favorite places most popular place was Top Dog which is still around (http://www.topdoghotdogs.com/).

But my favorite after party spot worldwide is without a doubt the La Sandwhicherie in South Beach Miami (http://www.lasandwicherie.com/)

there's still nothing like pink's hot dogs on la brea at 3am, or
canters deli (24 hours) on fairfax...

that is, of course, if you're in la.

I think there is only 1 SF donut shop worth its lard... Bob's Donuts on Polk.

Last time I was there I got raised glazed minutes from the oven and seconds
from glazing.  Pure heaven with a hole.

forget about those sugary little greeseballs they sell at Krispe Kreme.  I 
like my donuts big and puffy.  Bob's nails it.

Yeah, Krispy Kreme Kollektiv can suck a fuck, their donuts are disgusting.  
Mind you, I'll still eat half a dozen in one sitting while destroying a 
half a pot of coffee, but a big airy poofy glazed is THE BOMBA.

Best like that was Spudnuts. Interwebz Sirch sez:

I'm gonna be sad now.  But will try your suggestion troy.  Not the one

Subject: Re: [sfraves] things to do in berlin when you're...

Here's some tips from my wife's carpool mate Bodo who is from Berlin and is headed over to Berlin himself soon:

"He can't miss the Watergate (www.water-gate.de)  - it's a House/Deep House club right next to a river with outdoor space. Also, the WMF (www.wmfclub.de) is pretty good. Both are great and open all night.  Going late on the weekend is preferable (late is 3 or 4 in the morning - it's usually quite packed until 8 or 9 am).

Depending on the DJ, the Sage Club, Geburtstagsclub, Maria am Ostbahnhof can be pretty decent, too. Matrix is usually dark Trance but pretty rough.

For the ambient, flair, and the people, the WMF and Watergate are the first addresses - but it all depends on the DJ. Check the program online before."

Peace,

Peter

I think Americans are too conditioned by TV to sit and wait for the =20
hero to come in and fix things.  We all grew up knowing that the Lone =20
Ranger was going to ride in, or Batman was going to come in and punch =20
the bad guys and make everything all better, or we're taught to just =20
sit at home and pray for divine intervention, but none of that is =20
coming.  If we want the world to be a better place, we're going to =20

government that makes their money off of our taxes, and say "this is =20
how you're going to carry out your business."

http://www.deafdumbandblind.net/

hello Sean G -

there's this wonderful new DVD/CD series called The Other Side from Deaf
Dumb & Blind Communications which was co-founded by DB of Breakbeat Science
and NASA renown, that has video tours of cities given by DJs on the DVD and
a mix-CD.

i've only seen the Paris one so far and i loved it, very cool - Black
Strobe goes to art galleries and shops and eateries and other cool favorite
places - an "other side" to the official tourist sites of Paris.

when i saw your post you reminded me of this series because they have one
for Berlin with tour and mix by Ellen Allien .  :)

it's available at amazon.com

http://www.amazon.com/Other-Side-Berlin-Ellen-Allien/dp/B000MV8ALS/ref=sr_1_1/104-1584383-4448731?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1177458266&sr=8-1

no picture there but a good price.  :)

just thot you might want to know.

respectfully,
mary :)

hi Marc/(0)!  hope i spelled that right!  :)

The bestesss, most tasty, and under 5 dollars deal is chicos pizza on 
sixth/mission(because it is fresh), also the hot dog stands that pop up around 1015, 
cat club, and endup. Just before 4am would be seniores pizza on 19th and on el 
camino in san bruno, if u live that way. used to be that i would hit up 
dennys in the 90s but, now i hit these other places in a regular basis.

Here's Part 2.  Enjoy!

--

The people who started our country said basically, it's broken, we  
have to fix it.  If we want there to be a heaven or hell here on  
Earth, it's up to us to make sure which one it will be.  And they went  
out, and I know we're taught not to be confrontational, hate is bad,  
no matter whether the person deserves to be hated, but we're going to  
have to be confrontational.  Because the government and corporations  
are stealing our country from us, and we're going to have to take it  
back.  It's going to be a confrontation, there's no peaceful way to  
reverse the course that we're on right now.  I wish it was otherwise,  
I don't like it, but if we want these things to stop, we all have to  
make it stop, not just Mike Rivero, not just Alex Jones, Batman's not  
coming, you know, Superman's off making movies, we the people are  
going to have to change it.

heh...

thanks guys!  unfortunately due to multiple circumstances most
of the ambient mafia won't be able to play at this event.

it's a shame, as we've had a great time hosting the chillroom
at the last two stilldream events.  this one looks like it'll
be amazing as well.

good luck, paul - i'll keep my eyes/ears open for other
DJs/artists.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Harmony Festival - HUGE lineup

Does anyone else think it is VERY odd that their
website and adverts are using Greg Sandler's Harmony
graphics? Or something that VERY closely resembles the
old flowers and stuff?

Bastards.... and what, since they have regular old
bands this isn't a RAVE? This type of discrimination
against the dance community, doing events that are
nearly the same, is such a piece of shit! It all comes
down to money, who you grease, the age of the event
organizer, and ones ability to promise increased
revenue to the host venue/city....

Andy was right on about the old mantra of education
and introduction. If people had taken responsibility
for themselves, their friends, and made an attempt to
educate ONE new person... we wouldn't have dug this
hole for ourselves.

On the other hand, unless very carefully thought out
and executed, massives are nearly impossible to
implement in a positive way, as the clash of cultures,
ages, and intentions are extremely hard to melt in one
pot.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Harmony Festival - HUGE lineup

though i agree with some of what you wrote, it's clear that the event
is not being marketted as a rave.  though the main area on saturday
night will most likely look, feel, sound and smell like a rave
(without the over abundance of teenagers on E), the event itself is a
hippie/green/arts/music festival.

and not like Cyberfest was supposed to be a "festival."  it's a real
festival with attractions that do not center around nightime
electronic music.

i know not everybody loves them, but Skills can still put on a 10,000
person party that goes til 4am.  that's about as massive-like as SF
can get right now.

Joe, 

why don't you tell us a little about yourself, how you heard about the list, etc.

Not a secret, but Acid Totem is having a free outdoor in GGP this weekend.  Check it.  The weather promises to be amazing so that's where I'm heading if I can motivate my crew to leave the house.

Peace,

Peter

Thanks

Fuck!

Lots of love for Apollo and I'll certainly be thinking positive thoughts for him today.

Peace,

Peter

P.S.  N7, any idea if he needs anything besides love?

Sure, I'm a 24yr student at San Jose State, I am in the scene to dance my
ass off to great music, and to meet good people.  I was actually googling
looking for ravesf.com as I always for get its not ravessf.com, and found
sfraves.org and joined the list.  I have been to Save the Decks, Elmo's
Birthday, Be Happy, and Show your Love.  Will certainly be going to Lift 2,
Jumpin Jetsons and can't remember the name now, but the 3 day SF campout in
the middle of June.  I might be going to Filter SF this Saturday which ends
at 8am Sunday, so I may just be to tired to be able to get to the day party,
even though it sounds like it will be fun.  So that's some about me, if I'm
not to tired, I hope to see everyone this Sunday.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Harmony Festival - HUGE lineup

Great rant and funny you mention Disneyland because I was just at Disneyland with my family for Christmas and it actually reminded me in many ways of a rave.  
 
I have visited Disneyland in 4 different decades now, once when I was a little kid in the sixties (scared of the Materhorn), once in high school in the seventies (poly-drug use, running from police helicopters in Anaheim, left a trashed hotel room), and now twice with my own kids once in the nineties and once in whatever we call this decade.  I've learned something unique each time.

During this visit I learned that the real Disney heads come out for Christmas because many of the rides are altered for the occasion.  For example, the Haunted mansion was all decorated in a Tim Burton Nightmare Before Christmas motif.  The Christmas tree in the haunted mansion was fucking amazing.
 
People were dressed in ridiculous garb and doing weird shit everywhere. One fellow started talking to me randomly in line for a Churro.  He was wearing a Santa hat with Stitch ears and a t-shirt that said "Dork" on it.  "What's your favorite ride?"  he asked me.  I learned he lived nearby and came to Disneyland only for Chrismas.  This conversation wasn't that different from dozens I've had at raves and clubs with various people.

I met dozens of people that were just sweet and special and nice to talk to at Disneyland.  And many of them were clearly tripping to boot.  It was great and very much like a rave but without the beats. :(
 
I really wanted to go see Iggy but the logistics didn't work out.  Does Iggy look better or worse these days than Keith Richards?

Eeek!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] OW 420 Party Review

I dunno if someone responded to this yet.. but...

"So we headed back out to the other room for some trance room for some
solid trance
tracks (delivered by DDR I guess.)  What was that track with the lyric
"You've got
to lick it before you dick it" ? Ha ha!  That was some bitch ass trance! 
I didn't
know there was such a thing."

It goes: You gotta lick, b4 we kick it, you gotta get soft & wet before we
kick it"... the original vocal  was from a song called "Lick It" produced

Subject: Re: [sfraves] OW 420 Party Review

Nice explanation there, really sounds like something you need to try
to see if you like it or not.

Though I get what minimalism is for music, I'm not really sure what is
meant by techno, at least living hear in CA my whole life techno has
been a broad word for many types of electronic music.  Everything I
think of for techno goes from daft punk, monster anthems like
sandstorm to Dance Dance Revolution songs.  Seems like maybe in Japan
the genre is clearly defined?

TechnoHouse?  Probably way different then all the house I hear around
here though I'm guessing as the house music scene here makes me
shudder because it is so repetitive and monotone except for the break
downs where you don't dance.

Oh and we don't mind standing out in a crowd, we are used to it and
enjoy it.  So we will probably see you there this Saturday.

Subject: [sfraves] Raver's Guide to Berlin! (Re: things to do in berlin when you're...)

I am so excited that someone gave me an excuse to write a Berlin report 
for SFR! Yay!  My boyfriend and I just got back from a month's stay in 
Berlin, so I'm eager to share some things I've learned.



So here's my Raver's Guide to Berlin --

Friedrichshain- (district in Central/East Berlin, north of the Spree)- 
this is where the fun is!  More bars than you could possibly count, the 
best clubs in the city, and a record store on every block.  Really 
-there are so many record stores, it's ridiculous.  Pretty chill and 
pleasant during the day, and a major partying hub at night.  In the 
evening, young people go out bar and club-hopping, usually downing a 
beer and a jager on the way. (Jager bottles are probably the number one 
litter item, besides dog shit).  The atmosphere is almost festival-like 
on a busy night, with tons of people commuting to and from different 
parties. 


Audio-In - Libauer Strasse 19, Friedrichshain. 
This is my favorite record store in Berlin. High-quality used vinyl at 
decent prices.  We bought a lot of records during our trip, and the bulk 
of our haul came from this shop.  I was really impressed by the 
consistent quality of the tracks I found as well as the condition of the 
records.  Awesome record store!


Hard Wax - Paul-Lincke-Ufer 44a, Kreuzberg. www.hardwax.com
This is probably Berlin's most popular record store... Huge selection of 
new and used records, organized by label as opposed to genre.  A Guy 
Called Gerald happened to come in to spin some records while we were 
shopping there one day.


DNS - Eberswalder Strasse 30, Prenzlauerberg  www.dns-music.de
Another great record shop with a nice selection worth checking out, 
especially for techno, minimal, and electro.



Berghain/Panorama Bar, Friedrichshain  www.berghain.de
The notorious Berghain was one of my more surreal clubbing 
experiences... This place is built in a former power plant, so it's 
HUGE. The massive size of the building and cement interior give it the 
feeling of an industrial cathedral. I've been told that this place 
houses one of the largest sound systems in Europe, and I definitely 
believe it, it's quite loud.  The upstairs room, known as the Panorama 
Bar, is generally a good spot for minimal and electro. The main part of 
the club usually plays harder techno.  It's easy to be intimidated by 
this place, with the scary door guy and the sort of seedy atmosphere, 
but if you let go of your inhibitions it's pretty hard not to have a 
great time. I've heard that sometimes it's difficult for women to get 
in, as the place also doubles as a gay sex club, but I myself had no 
problems.  Check out the schedule of this place - they bring out major 
headliners almost every weekend.


Watergate, Kreuzberg www.water-gate.de
This place can have kind of a meat market vibe sometimes, but the music 
is consistently awesome. Wednesday nights is a great night for techno, I 
heard some amazing sounds here! The place is in a building that sits 
directly over the Spree, so the view at night is beautiful.  I was also 
really into the gorgeous  LED display that covers the walls and ceiling, 
which pulses and changes colors in time with the music.


Cassiopeia, Friedrichshain  www.cassiopeia-berlin.de
I don't think 'club' is the accurate term to describe this place.  It's 
a group of warehouses tucked away behind a brick wall that runs along 
Revaler Strasse in Friedrichshain. There are lots of sculptures and art 
inside the buildings as well as in the surrounding area, and I seem to 
remember there being a big skate ramp there.  There's not one but two 
free dub clubs on Wednesday nights, and the weekends have music all over 
the map, from techno to breakcore to punk rock to drum & bass....  Has a 
great underground vibe, though technically I think it is a permitted venue.


Wir Sind Park - www.myspace.com/wirsindpark
This crew usually throws free day parties around Berlin, but I was lucky 
enough to catch a one-off that they threw at a castle-like building on a 
small island in the middle of the Spree.  Really awesome vibe and three 
floors of great techno - not unlike an Otherworld or Friends & Family 
type party.  Since springtime is upon us, they probably have more 
outdoors planned for the coming weeks.


Techno is very much the dominant sound, although hard techno is 
definitely out. I was hearing a lot of deep, bassy, and surprisingly 
melodic techno, as well as the more standard minimal stuff that gets a 
lot of play in SF.  Neo-Trance is definitely a thing there, and the 
Schaffel craze seems to be pretty much dead at this point.  Breaks are 
almost non-existent, though electro is quite common.  You really can't 
go anywhere without hearing techno, even in little dive bars. It's the 
sound of Berlin.


The parties there are amazing... as opposed to the 10pm-6am standard 
partying time we have here in the Bay Area, Berliners party from about 
midnight on Friday night until early Monday morning.  A lot of clubs and 
parties go not only until dawn, but well into the following afternoon. 
(Leaving a party at 7am, we discovered, is "early").  If you can find 
any one-off events, they are much more cozy and friendly than the club 
scene, which can sometimes be exclusive and cliquey.


As for the question about the Love Parade- I was told that there will be 
no Love Parade this year, but I'm not sure if it will resume again in 
future years.  It seems the LP is no longer run by the original crew, 
and Dr. Motte isn't even involved at all any more.  Most Berliners seem 
way over it at this point. 


Ok, phew, that concludes my report on Berlin.   All in all- totally 
amazing city, techno paradise, and party kid's dream.


Love Chelsea Faith

Because of all the techno Disneyland that is Berlin, we are
experiencing a massive brain drain of talent from this country.

Almost every techno artists we've either booked in the past, or are
booking for the Filter parties for May and June, including Seth
Troxler and Someone Else, are all expatriating this summer. Catch em
while you can.

Welcome to sfraves Joe.

I'm Peter and I'm a much older person that also likes to dance to great music ;)

My wife is actually about to have a baby so I am mostly sidelined these days, although I obviously did get to go to one recent party.  Yay!

I may drag some of my family over the GGP Sunday if the weather comes through and I'll post to the list if I'm going to be there.

Peace,

Peter

P.S.  Ben Haus who is throwing the Sunday party is on the list here as well...

Sure, I'm a 24yr student at San Jose State, I am in the scene to dance my ass off to great music, and to meet good people.  I was actually googling looking for ravesf.com as I always for get its not ravessf.com, and found sfraves.org and joined the list.  I have been to Save the Decks, Elmo's Birthday, Be Happy, and Show your Love.  Will certainly be going to Lift 2, Jumpin Jetsons and can't remember the name now, but the 3 day SF campout in the middle of June.  I might be going to Filter SF this Saturday which ends at 8am Sunday, so I may just be to tired to be able to get to the day party, even though it sounds like it will be fun.  So that's some about me, if I'm not to tired, I hope to see everyone this Sunday.

why don't you tell us a little about yourself, how you heard about the list, etc. 

Not a secret, but Acid Totem is having a free outdoor in GGP this weekend.  Check it.  The weather promises to be amazing so that's where I'm heading if I can motivate my crew to leave the house.

Peace, 

Peter

I am so excited that someone gave me an excuse to write a Berlin report 
for SFR! Yay!  My boyfriend and I just got back from a month's stay in 
Berlin, so I'm eager to share some things I've learned.



So here's my Raver's Guide to Berlin --

Friedrichshain- (district in Central/East Berlin, north of the Spree)- 
this is where the fun is!  More bars than you could possibly count, the 
best clubs in the city, and a record store on every block.  Really 
-there are so many record stores, it's ridiculous.  Pretty chill and 
pleasant during the day, and a major partying hub at night.  In the 
evening, young people go out bar and club-hopping, usually downing a 
beer and a jager on the way. (Jager bottles are probably the number one 
litter item, besides dog shit).  The atmosphere is almost festival-like 
on a busy night, with tons of people commuting to and from different 
parties. 


Audio-In - Libauer Strasse 19, Friedrichshain. 
This is my favorite record store in Berlin. High-quality used vinyl at 
decent prices.  We bought a lot of records during our trip, and the bulk 
of our haul came from this shop.  I was really impressed by the 
consistent quality of the tracks I found as well as the condition of the 
records.  Awesome record store!


Hard Wax - Paul-Lincke-Ufer 44a, Kreuzberg. www.hardwax.com
This is probably Berlin's most popular record store... Huge selection of 
new and used records, organized by label as opposed to genre.  A Guy 
Called Gerald happened to come in to spin some records while we were 
shopping there one day.


DNS - Eberswalder Strasse 30, Prenzlauerberg  www.dns-music.de
Another great record shop with a nice selection worth checking out, 
especially for techno, minimal, and electro.



Berghain/Panorama Bar, Friedrichshain  www.berghain.de
The notorious Berghain was one of my more surreal clubbing 
experiences... This place is built in a former power plant, so it's 
HUGE. The massive size of the building and cement interior give it the 
feeling of an industrial cathedral. I've been told that this place 
houses one of the largest sound systems in Europe, and I definitely 
believe it, it's quite loud.  The upstairs room, known as the Panorama 
Bar, is generally a good spot for minimal and electro. The main part of 
the club usually plays harder techno.  It's easy to be intimidated by 
this place, with the scary door guy and the sort of seedy atmosphere, 
but if you let go of your inhibitions it's pretty hard not to have a 
great time. I've heard that sometimes it's difficult for women to get 
in, as the place also doubles as a gay sex club, but I myself had no 
problems.  Check out the schedule of this place - they bring out major 
headliners almost every weekend.


Watergate, Kreuzberg www.water-gate.de
This place can have kind of a meat market vibe sometimes, but the music 
is consistently awesome. Wednesday nights is a great night for techno, I 
heard some amazing sounds here! The place is in a building that sits 
directly over the Spree, so the view at night is beautiful.  I was also 
really into the gorgeous  LED display that covers the walls and ceiling, 
which pulses and changes colors in time with the music.


Cassiopeia, Friedrichshain  www.cassiopeia-berlin.de
I don't think 'club' is the accurate term to describe this place.  It's 
a group of warehouses tucked away behind a brick wall that runs along 
Revaler Strasse in Friedrichshain. There are lots of sculptures and art 
inside the buildings as well as in the surrounding area, and I seem to 
remember there being a big skate ramp there.  There's not one but two 
free dub clubs on Wednesday nights, and the weekends have music all over 
the map, from techno to breakcore to punk rock to drum & bass....  Has a 
great underground vibe, though technically I think it is a permitted venue.


Wir Sind Park - www.myspace.com/wirsindpark
This crew usually throws free day parties around Berlin, but I was lucky 
enough to catch a one-off that they threw at a castle-like building on a 
small island in the middle of the Spree.  Really awesome vibe and three 
floors of great techno - not unlike an Otherworld or Friends & Family 
type party.  Since springtime is upon us, they probably have more 
outdoors planned for the coming weeks.


Techno is very much the dominant sound, although hard techno is 
definitely out. I was hearing a lot of deep, bassy, and surprisingly 
melodic techno, as well as the more standard minimal stuff that gets a 
lot of play in SF.  Neo-Trance is definitely a thing there, and the 
Schaffel craze seems to be pretty much dead at this point.  Breaks are 
almost non-existent, though electro is quite common.  You really can't 
go anywhere without hearing techno, even in little dive bars. It's the 
sound of Berlin.


The parties there are amazing... as opposed to the 10pm-6am standard 
partying time we have here in the Bay Area, Berliners party from about 
midnight on Friday night until early Monday morning.  A lot of clubs and 
parties go not only until dawn, but well into the following afternoon. 
(Leaving a party at 7am, we discovered, is "early").  If you can find 
any one-off events, they are much more cozy and friendly than the club 
scene, which can sometimes be exclusive and cliquey.


As for the question about the Love Parade- I was told that there will be 
no Love Parade this year, but I'm not sure if it will resume again in 
future years.  It seems the LP is no longer run by the original crew, 
and Dr. Motte isn't even involved at all any more.  Most Berliners seem 
way over it at this point. 


Ok, phew, that concludes my report on Berlin.   All in all- totally 
amazing city, techno paradise, and party kid's dream.


Love Chelsea Faith

You sure that was even DDR playing that? I thought that was one of Heather 
Heart's last tracks. Either way, it wasn't trance it was being mixed 
with...it was still techno ;)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Tonal - Pimpin' Purple underground this Saturday!

Rock It Science, Prismatic Tracks, Crush Collective, and sfhousemusic.com
present...

Tonal: Pimpin' Purple 

SF Location: call 888-482-9281 or 415-412-0406, or visit prismatictracks.com
or sfhousemusic.com the day of for directions 

$5 before 10:30, $10 before midnight, $15 after

Free mix CD for dressing in Pimpin' Purple (make some serious effort
people!)

Happy Birthdays: Marcus Jerard, Buddha, and Ajay!
 
Shamrock Green was definitely one of the most rocking parties this spring,
with a great vibe from start to finish, amazing music all night (especially
Justin Long's set!), and dancers bugging out until the early morning.
Everybody's asking what's next?  Get ready for the next throwdown in this
series of sick new color themed parties brought to you by some of the
hottest crews in the underground house scene--Tonal: Pimpin' Purple! Tonal
parties continue showcase talent flown in from out of town as well as some
of your favorite local house jocks. We look forward to continuing to bring
you high quality events, so strap on your dancing shoes, bring everybody you
know and get ready to move it! 
 
DJ's:

Matt e Starr (Portland Housing Authority, Portland OR)

Mr. Starr is Portland's secret weapon!  Matt e's weekly afterhours party has
brought some of the biggest and best dj's in house music to Portland.   As a
DJ, Matt e has kept them dancing all over Portland, Oregon -- in nightclubs,
ballrooms, basements, lofts, warehouses, hotel suites, and in the great
outdoors. Having made his public debut at Burning Man 2001, Matt e travels
far and wide with his vinyl, having many opportunities to represent
Portland's House community while entertaining diverse audiences in
California, Washington, Nevada, and Canada.  Don't miss this exclusive
appearance at Tonal!

Marcus Jerard (Jack Attack, Kolony, Endup)--Happy Birthday!

A veteran of the SF scene, Marcus Jerard throws down like it's nobody's
business.  Hearing his sound and his mixing style, one would swear he's from
Chicago.  Marcus moves deftly through jackin' beats, acid tracks, and
anything else that will cause dancefloor freakouts.  His Jack Attack parties
brought us standout dj's such as Derrick Carter, Justin Long, John Larner,
and many more.  We are thrilled that Mr. Jerard has decided to celebrate his
birthday with us...get ready to jack your body! 

Rouzbeh (Back2Basics)

Holding it down on the funkier side of things for the Back 2 Basics crew,
Rouzbeh combines excellent track selection and mixing skills with the kind
of energy that makes you put your hands in the air and stomp your feet to
the beat.  Rouzbeh's crew consistently throws raging parties that last 'til
the break of dawn, featuring diverse dj's such as Heather, Lawnchair
Generals, and Derrick May (who incidentally made an appearance at our Tonal:
Fire Engine Red party after playing Back 2 Basics) to name a few.  Something
tells us you're going to need yoga the next day... 

Eric Sharp (Rock It Science) vs. Shrimp (Dustfish, Joint Effort)

If you happened to stumble into Anon Salon on March 24, you may have
witnessed Eric jumping on the decks impromptu with Shrimp as part of his
unending birthday celebration.  The madness that ensued on the dancefloor
could not be contained to one night, so we're getting these loons back
together for a 2 and 1/2 hour opening set, setting the shenanigans just
right.  Get there early in order to not miss this tag team action! 

Andrew Phelan & Origami (Prismatic, So Sound, Drop Music)

Andrew and Origami are blowing up on the production tip, with recent
signings of their tracks on some hot new mix compilations as well as their
upcoming EP on the one of the UK's pinnacle labels: Drop Music.  Andrew's
grooves and precise mixing combined with Origami's uber funky live bass
stylings are going to close the night out proper this time, taking us in for
the perfect landing.  Woot! 

Rob Crush (Crush Collective)

Aptly named, Mr. Crush will be leaving some squished bodies on the
dancefloor.  Hate to say we told you so, but even in the time since Rob's
first appearance for us he has already shared the decks with Stompy's Deron
and Om's Troydon at Minx, one of SF's most solid weeklies on Thursdays at
Endup.  Prepare yourself for some hot new cuts, as we're sure Rob's Miami
WMC trip yielded some serious results...

He just played the accapella over his Acid Yummy :n)

Anywaze... the song is sung by the artist Roula & the compelation was
released in 95... this was JJ Flores's like 1st foray into like house
music as his start with production in the music industry was with
Freestyle music like other house dj/ producers like Tony Moran & Omar
Santana... If you didn't get that info.. the original song itself is a
booty club house song... :n)

The request for someone to introduce themself in the OW discussion earlier
today inspired me that I should probably do the same, since I've never
really said much about myself and have been posting every once in a while
more or less in anonymity.  So here goes:

My name is Matt, I'm 22 years old, originally from Texas, and an engineering
student at Stanford.  Before transferring to Stanford, I went to the US
Naval Academy (and was active duty US Navy as a result), and left because of
medical disqualification after one of my lungs spontaneously collapsed. I've
been listening to EDM since 2000, after a friend basically forced me to sit
still and listen to Sasha's San Francisco Global Underground compilation.
So from the beginning, San Francisco and the bay area has stood out in my
mind as being one of the great places for great music, and so far it's been
proving me right.  I've been a bedroom DJ since 2001, spinning mostly tech
and progressive house, had a twice-weekly radio show at the Naval Academy,
and am still looking for opportunities to promote myself in that regard. I
love house and techno and progressive house (especially older stuff).  I
found this list after friends took me to a great breaks party at the
Gingerbread Warehouse last year, which was my first real exposure to the
underground (Houston doesn't really have one), and I loved it. Started
searching online and asking people about how to find other sick parties,
stumbled on the list.  I've been going to Tonal parties pretty consistently
since finding the list (keep up the AWESOME work Andrew), am going to
finally drag my ass to an Otherworld night one of these days, end up going
to "regular" clubs semi-infrequently (usually if one of my favorite DJ's is
in town).  Even though I'm relatively young and new to this scene, I'm no
candy kid, would rather have dirty beats than pills given the choice, and am
probably more jaded than I should be at my age.  From the list, I've met J.C.
and said hi to Andrew Phelan in passing at Tonal, and I'd like to make more
of your aquaintances.  If any of you are venturing to see Nick Warren (even
though it's at Ruby Skye) or to Tonal this week, let me know so we can say
hi.

That's the basic rundown, feel free to drop me a note or google chat
whenever.  Hope to see y'all out at night!

-Matt

Sorry about the narrow range of quotes.  I guess I have a limited  
imagination and a one track mind these days.  Bear with, we'll get  
through this storm together.

It's hard to tell you know tone of voice, though I'm probably stating the
obvious here that he meant that your sets awesome, but just like many thing=

have become slang when said in a certain tone, such as damn that was so bad
ass, really meaning the opposite, but we know it because of the tone of
voice.

 when you're...)


there is PLENTY of world class techno goodness in SF.  It's just 
disconnected from the techno scene.  Don't understand why, but that's how 
it is.

i play the kind of techno you don't fall asleep to, that doesn't make you 
feel smart.  but is NOT trance, is NOT acid techno DDR/Liberator style.  
like 313/berlin/chitown/with a little bit of SF/SanJose krunkiness thrown 
in.

Why is acid house like 90000 times more hypnotic than trance.

Trance has the worst name ever.  It should be called "teenage overdose=20
shitty kickdrum sounds like a nitrous balloon with bad arpeggiations and=20
so many breakdowns it shouldn't be sold as dance music but instead sold=20
to Lexus for use in ads".  That would be more accurate.

Some of you know why we're not going this year, and the rest will find out soon enough!!! 

I've got a 3-day pass I'm trying to dump for $200.00 (about $80.00 off cover), hit me up offlist if interested. These are hard tickets. . .

prepare accordingly.

There's a late night convenience store and pizza stand nearby for provisions.

I don't know the details of his condition or anything; but having had  
to subsist on hospital "food" for extended periods of time myself, I  
bet he'd appreciate having something that's actually edible smuggled  
in to him.  That was one of the things I most appreciated during  
chemo.  That, and my friend who loaned me his game boy... daytime  
basic hospital cable starts to seriously rot the brain after about a  
day.

DDR/Liberator style kicks ass.

More people should bang it like that.

That japanese cat from Tresor (FumiyaTanaka or some such shit) is gonna be 
in town tomorrow night if anyone gives a fuck about that.

We just need less of that boring minimal crap. So few DJ's make minimal 
work, it gets old quick.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

I saw the subject line that Apollo's in the hospital, I haven't read  
any of the actual messages yet, so I don't know the details, I'm  
strictly on webmail right now and it's up and down and invariably slow  
so I'll get to them, that's all I can say for now.

Anyway, if I were there I'd say something like get well soon, and get  
well enough to get out of the hospital.  I think I inherited my  
grandmother's fear of them.  So get well soon.

Subject: [sfraves] Canvas Gallery is closing?!?!

Saturday April 28 @ 6 pm 2007
Dutch Queensday/Canvas Gallery Closing Forever Party

I had just recently heard that the Canvas is closing (seems like I 
should spell closing with 2 n's in honor of the dutch too), and today is 
the day! :)  Well, they're going out with a true party, as anyone 
should!   Firstly, they're spinning "The Wheel Of Fortune" every hour, 
using it for chosing drink specials (gotta get rid of that extra stock I 
guess.)

And in honor of Queensday there will be $3 pints of Pilsner Urquell 
until 10 PM.

Dutch Snacks Available

Orange Party Favors (it is Queensday!)


Lastly, if you think you're planning on going, email me and I can 
possibly work out some guestlist action and/or some goodies.


The Canvas Art Gallery
1200 9th Ave @ Lincoln Ave in the Inner Sunset

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Send some healthy vibes to Apollo-

Apollo is one of those figures that stick out in your mind. :) I
remember seeing him at every other goddamn party I went to, for a
while, puffing on what looked like a car cigarette lighter... then I'd
run into him at the haight street fair, or power to the peaceful, or
some other RANDOM ass spot, just surfing the vibe...

Anyway. One of god's special creatures. Be well, dude.

Well whatever, well at least I like my progressive trance and I like having
breaks to have a breather inbetween dancing my ass off.  Though I do also
love my acid trance, just no shitty ass house thank you, also there is
certainly a lot of crap trance out there like most of Tiesto's stuff.

wattup kids???!!! Just moved to SF....love it! need a place tho.... here's
my craig's list posting, if you know of anyone or anthing plz lemme know,
thought it was worth a try!! w00t!
--->b

Vermont transplant seeking housemates/room/sublet/warehouse/whatever. New to
the city, excited, quite scared; hoping to find an intelligent, honest,
creative, open-minded, eccentric and/or slightly crazy group or household of
twenty-something year-olds to live with. Definitely through August, possibly
(probably) longer. Easy access to MUNI would be sweet but I don't mind
walking. It's not crucial, but I'm hoping to stay on the less-sketchy end of
sketchy regarding neighborhoods, mostly because I'm unaccustomed to city
living. I have a 9-5 M-F job downtown (=steady income) but not a 9-5 life!

LATE NIGHTS, renegade PARTIES, LOUD MUSIC, friends, DOGS, beer, 420, random
adventures, family-style meal(s), movies but no TV, reasonable tidiness, and
general CARPE DIEM attitude *A MUST!*

about me:
-Male
-very easygoing, articulate, enthusiastic, honest, handy, and down-to-earth
-finished two years at Middlebury College in Middlebury, VT (didn't like it
so i'm transferring)
-i am a serious basshead:: been DJing (vinyl only!!) close to 8 years,
predominantly drum n' bass/jungle and breaks
-i can fix anything electronic and/or mechanical (as long as it can be
fixed). i mean n-e-thing!
-i love making sushi, cooking, and baking bread
-i find cleaning my living space (and dishes, kitchen, etc) not only
important but downright theraputic, and therefore volunteer willingly with
said chores
-i am allergic to almost every domesticated animal with hair, the fortunate
exception being dogs (who i love and understand implicitly)

Subject: [sfraves] Adriann needs you vibes & thoughts  Re: [sfraves] Anyone heard 
     from Adrianna?

I just got a call like 3 minutes ago from Adrianna's BF, he told me that
this morning, Adrianna was in mondo yucky pain, screaming & yeling,  then
was re-admitted to the hospital... apparetnly what happen was on Wed when
she went in for that surgery thingie to take out that syst or whatever
(sorry, she was pretty vague about surgery #1)... but the doctor's might
accidentally cut a hole in her stomach or the intestine or something, &
the hole kinda got bigger or soemthing... so now she's in the hospital
again... docs are doin' tests to figure out what exactly the problem is..
hopefully it can all be solved through meds, but if the problem is bigger
tahn that... she may need to go to surgery again!

So Please Please Please.. send out some yummy energy to her that she gets
better!  Me & MOD may go visit her in the hospital tomorrow!

Take Care <3
Peace=->Jus' Me =-> O§bY {8O)

but I love Dogs and have two...

Seriously though... welcome to the list and good luck
finding housing. There is a service I used once off of
Haight street that connects renters to rooms... But
Craigs list might just as good now.

PS... the ass comment was from earllier... I had
called myself an ass, and phillip confirmed it
apparently...

 So I did a test e-mail the other day because I haven't received any SFR mail for the past week and a half. Apparently I'm still able to *send* to the list, I just can't receive any e-mails *from* it. Anyone know what's up? I checked my spam folder etc. and they are nowhere to be found. I might just try unsubbing and then subbing again, but I thought I would check with you all first to see if any of you have had this problem before.
 
 Any while this may seem obvious, just a reminder to be sure to "reply all" or reply only to me since I of course would not receive a response if it was to the list alone.
 
 Thanks in advance!
 
 Heart,
 Alida

I'll tell ya what the problem is...

AOL


It sucks in every way imaginable.

Actually, that might not be the problem, but I just like blaming everything 
on AOL. Doing work where I have to send important emails to customers 
everyday, AOL is always the worst when it comes to stuff "disappearing" 
after it's been sent.

Tanker Explosion Melts 250 Foot Section of I-580

Updated April 29, 2007 at 8:10 a.m.

OAKLAND (KRON) -- At least 250 feet of Interstate 580 has collapsed
after a tanker truck caught on fire early Sunday morning in the maze
area near the Bay Bridge approach.

"Our initial investigation leads us to believe he was traveling at an
unsafe speed," CHP officer Trent Cross told KRON 4's Jeff Pierce live
on the KRON 4 Weekend Morning News.  "He struck the guard rail and
overturned.  He was carrying approximately 8,600 gallons of gasoline
and it caught fire.  Due to the intensity of the heat it caused part
of the freeway to melt and collapse."

Cross says the driver of the truck walked to a nearby gas station,
then caught a taxicab to Kaiser Oakland where he's being treated for
second degree burns to the arms and face.   There are no other reports
of injuries.

KRON 4's Stanley Roberts talked with one witness who initially thought
the blast was a terror attack.  Flames from the explosion lit the
early morning sky for miles.

The collapsed freeway is certain to cause major traffic problems
leading into the Monday morning commute and could slow fans going to
the Golden State Warriors playoff game at the Oakland Arena Sunday
evening.

"It's going to be closed for a while," Officer Cross said.  "People
are going to have to consider alternate routes and make sure you give
yourself plenty of time to get to where you're going.  The last thing
you want to do is to get caught speeding in the morning along the way
to work or you may consider the possibility of taking public
transportation."

BART officials say they are considering ways to make sure the system
is at maximum capacity Monday since ridership is expected to soar with
the freeway closure.

Ditto on aol being the suck.  Weren't there some stories a while back  
about them just deciding that entire IP blocks and/or domain names  
were automatically spam and blocking them before they could even get  
to your spam folder?  But yeah if there were ever a company that, in  
general, just doesn't get along with the rest of the internet, it's aol.

I'd say just get a gmail address, set it up for POP, use Mail.app or  
Thunderbird, and be done with all the headaches.  I don't even think  
you need an invitation anymore.

I'd strongly advise going yahoo mail, rather than gmail, for mailing lists.

Yahoo has really good filtering.  I'm subscribed to about 6 mailing lists from this viberation account and use Yahoo's webmail interface to control it all.  The filtering is perfect.

Subbing to a list with gmail is a headache, it has no folders and everything goes into the inbox.

THat's why you use thunderbird and set up filters.

And if invites are still needed, I can supply (invites.)

Yeah. Minimal and deep house are for old people that can't shake their
asses anymore. ;) Imagine what would happen if you bumped some hard
crazy techno at stafford.... I think some hearts would explode. ;)

Aaaanyway, thanks for the advice kiddos -- esp. u Chelc. :) I'm
already in Ireland (hit up a UG here the other night: the boys can't
dance and the girls are ugly) and I'll be in Berlin in like 2 weeks!!!
stoked.

I resemble that remark.  Hey if you dropped some techno at Stafford Lake some of us old timers might dance!  If we could remember where we left our canes that is.

:P

Since you are in Ireland you must try the national specialty: the butter and cheese sandwhich.  In case you can't afford to dine out, here's how to make one yerself:  

Take bread, preferably white bread so it has little/no nutritional value, apply butter in excess as if it was mayonaise then add lots of cheese.  Consume.  For a variation, fry the sandwhich in butter.

Our childcare person is Irish and she is always feeding the boys butter and cheese sandwhiches, despite my objections. She seems to believe that no amount of dairy products can be too much for growing boys.

Can't wait to hear a Berlin report.

Peace,

Peter

Yeah. Minimal and deep house are for old people that can't shake their
asses anymore. ;) Imagine what would happen if you bumped some hard
crazy techno at stafford.... I think some hearts would explode. ;)

Aaaanyway, thanks for the advice kiddos -- esp. u Chelc. :) I'm
already in Ireland (hit up a UG here the other night: the boys can't
dance and the girls are ugly) and I'll be in Berlin in like 2 weeks!!!
stoked.

peace,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) Tanker Explosion Melts 250 Foot Section of I-580

I love how SF mayor, Gavin "Alcoholic, but never too drunk to fuck" Newsom 
jumps in claiming our freeways aren't safe and we'd be screwed in an 
earthquake stating "It's not a matter of if, but when."  WTF ? ? ?  The 
METAL overpass structure was heated to somewhere between 2-3k degrees.  Tell 
me how that has any bearing [sic] on the earthquake preparedness ?

And who gives a flying F what Newsom thinks ?  Did anyone talk to Ron 
Dellums ?  Oh, he was probobably busy trying to triage the situation and get 
things done instead of holding press conferences and whining to the 
governator.

I'm all for less regulation considering the piles and piles of red tape we 
all seem to have to weed through everyday, but after 2 massive gasoline 
explosions in 20 years within 5 miles of each other (Caldecot Tunnel) I 
think maybe Walt the janitor shouldn't be allowed to drive gasoline tanker 
trucks just because his cousin got him the job.  Didn't the same thing 
happen not long ago in San Diego ?  Stick the standard guys with Diesel or 
Jet-A and require gasoline haulers to be the veritable "top guns" of the 
hauling industry.  Since gas is so expensive now anyway, the added expense 
of requiring gasoline haulers to work only 6-hr shifts instead of possibly 
10-hr shifts is a drop in the bucket.  Hell, make it also a requirement to 
pay them $5/hr more than the non-gasoline haulers at the same company... 
something.  Oh, I got it, a g-force meter that automatically kicks in a 
governer when the truck isn't being driven old-lady style.  Shit, all of the 
above.  I dunno, gasoline is a dangerous chemical and even as a kid i was 
fascinated how just two thin layers of aluminum or stainless and foam 
separate everyone on the road from thousands of gallons of explosive liquid.

Tanker Explosion Melts 250 Foot Section of I-580

Updated April 29, 2007 at 8:10 a.m.

OAKLAND (KRON) -- At least 250 feet of Interstate 580 has collapsed
after a tanker truck caught on fire early Sunday morning in the maze
area near the Bay Bridge approach.

"Our initial investigation leads us to believe he was traveling at an
unsafe speed," CHP officer Trent Cross told KRON 4's Jeff Pierce live
on the KRON 4 Weekend Morning News.  "He struck the guard rail and
overturned.  He was carrying approximately 8,600 gallons of gasoline
and it caught fire.  Due to the intensity of the heat it caused part
of the freeway to melt and collapse."

Cross says the driver of the truck walked to a nearby gas station,
then caught a taxicab to Kaiser Oakland where he's being treated for
second degree burns to the arms and face.   There are no other reports
of injuries.

KRON 4's Stanley Roberts talked with one witness who initially thought
the blast was a terror attack.  Flames from the explosion lit the
early morning sky for miles.

The collapsed freeway is certain to cause major traffic problems
leading into the Monday morning commute and could slow fans going to
the Golden State Warriors playoff game at the Oakland Arena Sunday
evening.

"It's going to be closed for a while," Officer Cross said.  "People
are going to have to consider alternate routes and make sure you give
yourself plenty of time to get to where you're going.  The last thing
you want to do is to get caught speeding in the morning along the way
to work or you may consider the possibility of taking public
transportation."

BART officials say they are considering ways to make sure the system
is at maximum capacity Monday since ridership is expected to soar with
the freeway closure.

duuuude. I've noticed they're crazy about the dairy products here. If

that's the only litter I've seen in the streets. Ice cream wrappers

  Yeah, thanks everyone. :P
 
 Terry fixed it and NO it didn't have anything to do with the fact that it was AOL.
 
 And FYI, I only use my ancient AOL account for SFR because it's what I've used for years and I don't want to bog up my other accounts with all the SFR associated unsolicited subbing to random club promotion lists. *phew* SO THERE.
