Subject: [sfraves] WR1: Thursday night/ Friday Morning Adventure!

4PM: Caught the WESTcat 2 go 2 the HTC 2 Catch the bus 2 go 2 BART...

5:30PM: Waiting aboveground 4 Joey who i never met, but Fat Ass Brian from New Orleans wants me 2 show him a good time in Bay Area night life!  Finally showed up @ 6 something & we eat @ Subway...

7PM:  After walking down 1st Street tryin' 2 hail a cab, we finally got a cab & headed over 2 Sublounge... the Cabby was a nice Dude... grrrrr... Giants Game crowd 'caused some traffic & I was late 2 meet up w/ Jonas!

8PM: had a few drinks, like 2 I think, & like totally Groove 2 the upstairs sets... Jonas spun alota deep house, Lost spun alota ummm... Prog house was it?  Then we went down stairs to sett up... Jonas hooks up the MIC & I talk a lil' bit on it, Mic check & so forth... Lost hops on the decks again & spins trance.. it was fun!  Calamity Jane enters the basement & struts her way down 2 the DJ booth... slowly... more & more Family are in Sublounge!  Joey felt kinda like overwhelmed that he met alota people already...LoL:

"Dude," I said, "this is sooooo just the beginning Homie!  there's still more people you're gonna meet 2night!"

"Oh MY," Joey said!  LoL

9PM: Shelly spun this Awesome set upstairs containing Hip Hop, & some down tempo.. Loved it!!  The next DJ after that was strait up spinning Hip Hop!!  Downstairs there was alota house Music goin' on!!  Ms Jane broke it down & started spinning yummy breakbeats!!  Loved it!!  Hella Danicng my ass off the whole time while tryin 2 B social w/ every1 there!!  The Upstairs was getting full!  Met hella Groovy people...

10:30PM:  Got a ride w/ Heidi 2 Anu... me & Joey rode w/ Shoe in Lost in the car also... LoL... That musta been 1 of the funnest car rides I had in a loooong time!!  I heard "The detachable Penis" song 4 the 1st time & we ended up asking people in other cars outta window if they saw our detachable penises... Lol  Hello 2Day.. LoL

11:30PM:  Been hangin' out w/ Shazbot, Melissa, their friends, Seraphim, & the Anu bar hoppers... Serephim dedicated an electro clash tune in her set 2 me... "I wanna be a cowboy" & we were hopping up & down on the dancefloor like gleeful tourists from Japan or soemthing... it was fun!!  

Then Shazbot hit the decks... ok.. all I gotta say is GOOD FUCKIN SHIT!!!  I've always Loved Shaz & his house sets, but fuuuuuuuuuuckin' A man... hello 2day.. I think this set beats out all the other sets I've ever heard him spin!!!  I mean... OK... he totally spun like these Awesome electro clash tunes like in the begining of his set, then went in2 house which I was expecting anyway 'cause he is a house DJ, but OK... this kinda house he was spinning was all like bleepy Bloppy House w/ like these weird alien sounds.. I Loved it!!!  Minimal House??  Minimanl Techno??? I dunno, but it was fun!!  Me, Calamity J, & Origami were bein; total dance floor hogs & it was fun!  Oh yeah it was fun!

Joey is good @ socializing w/ people! YAY... I'm hangin' out w/ another social butterfly!! How Dope!

12AM: We walk over 2 Cloud 9... and saw Mal & Sharp... LoL.. I talk 2 Sharp about a funny story that Seraphim told me early & he just looked @ me eyes mondo wide open, nodding his head, & laughing @ the same time..LMAO... Hello 2day... Mal tells the bouncers that me & guest are on GL so we go in...

OK... so unfortunately, the Jungle that Joey was yearning 4 didn't happen that night... there was a previous event planned there & the music was all Top 40 stuff upstairs & house downstairs... but like Mal totally broke it down & spun Breakbeats that oh yeah... but I dunno... the crowd was like totally yucky, the vibe was totally plastic 23 say the least, & altough I Love & support Mal, it didn't really feel right bein' there... so we left after like an hour I think...

1AM: We're over @ End Up... Oh My Goodness... 1 of the best fuckn' bouncers in the Bay Area.. Rudy.. who I haven't seeeeeeeen in a loooooong time was bouncing @ the door & we spent like 10 minutes catching up!  LoL... he even like got me in on his GL so we could pay a 2 for 1 @ the door 2 go in... LoL

The End up was fun.. I mean... it was all like deep house while we were there, but what was funny was they hella stepped it up during the last set & things got like hella bassy, progresive, disco-ie, & fun!

We met alota Groovy people there.. Oh MY goodness man... I finally saw Charlette (the baroness) after heeeeeeeella fuckin' years & we talked & talked & talked & talked... I'm very proud of her DJ career now... but it was fun catchin' up w/ her...

3AM:  We end up leaving the end up 'cause we're both kinda beat from all the frolicing around the City.. but it was such a bad ass time!  We endup walking back up 2 market & up some in the TL 2 go 2 his pad & decided 2 take a cab 2 his place 'cause it was confussing a lil'...  LoL... our cab driver thanks us 4 bein' his 1st passengers ever 'cause he just started workin' that night! LoL

5:30AM: I'm on my way back home on BART listening 2 my walkman & scare people... LoL

7:30AM: HOme Finally... =)

OK.. so that was my adventure... LoL...



Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Shazbot @ BAD KITTY Thursday


Thanks Jonas and Shazbot for your support! You guys are funny :)

How did the event at Sublounge turnout?

Unfortunately due to an unexpected job interview (which totally sucked
ass) I couldn't make it out. I did make it back in time for Bad Kitty
though, and Shazbot rocked the house Bad Kitty stylee!

Thanks to all who have been supporting Bad Kitty in crack central -
We've had great success and great times so far, and are going to keep
the nasty electro.punk.disco.booty.trash coming...
Thursdays have definitely been going off lately, should be a great
Summer!

Next week Queen Agnes B is gracing us with her royalty, as well as a
few other filthy suprises... its all BAD.

Meow,

I know, I know... there's this lovey-dovey benefit going down at the
Sublounge with a ton of well-known DJs and the entire rave scene 
hipster
collective is going to be there.

But if you want to hear something new and *different*, something a bit
naughty and dirty, or if you're just a broke-ass mofo that can't swing
the cab fare, come down to Anu Thursday night for BAD KITTY. I'll be on
'round 11:30 bringing a dastardly mix of nasty minimal techno, acid
house, some electro("clash"), and all sorts of weird stuff.

So here's your choice:

Party with a bunch of patchouli-scented ravers to music that you can
hear any other night of the week, way out in China Basin...

OR:

Rock out with your cock out to some funky shit you ain't never heard
before, and have a nice conversation with a Mission crackhead on your
way out.

I trust you'll make the right decision.

Cheers,

David Mancuso's Disco Wonderland
King of Clubs
by Tim Lawrence
May 28th, 2004 4:00 PM

The party space, with its huge mirror ball and DNA strands of multicolored 
balloons, combines Alice in Wonderland with astrophysics. "City, Country, 
City" percolates through five stacks of Klipschorn speakers and sounds so 
live that, if you close your eyes, War could be playing in the same room. 
As the percussive tempo builds, dancers regress, screaming and whooping as 
they execute spinning-top turns and syncopated jazz flicks. It could be 
1974, but it's 2004. After an agonizing hiatus, the Loft is back. And party 
host David Mancuso is refusing to change with the times.

The Loft began life in 1970 as an unnamed, one-off rent party when Mancuso, 
an antiques dealer, decided to put on a Valentine's Day bash in his 
ex-industrial home to supplement his irregular income. In a reference to 
universal love and psychedelic enlightenment, the party invites were 
inscribed with the words "Love Saves the Day," and Mancuso ended up 
spinning records from midnight until six in the morning. "The idea of being 
a DJ never crossed my mind," he says. "I only did it because I was with my 
friends and we were all into the same music."

At the end of that first night, Mancuso's guests­a definitive cross-section 
of New York's displaced citizens­made it clear that they wanted more of the 
same, and within a couple of months the host had succumbed to the 
inevitability of a weekly party. By the middle of 1971, the events were 
being referred to as the Loft. "I wasn't looking for a name," says Mancuso. 
"But people started to refer to my space as David's Loft. It was a given 
name and I accepted it."

Mancuso's subsequent influence on the dance underground is hard to 
overestimate. The Tenth Floor, the Gallery, 12 West, Reade Street, the 
Warehouse, and the Paradise Garage were modeled on his private-party 
template. Club kids such as Nicky Siano, Larry Levan, Frankie Knuckles, 
Tony Humphries, and David Morales fell under his aural spell before they 
proceeded to embark on their own turntablist adventures. Even fellow DJs 
treated Mancuso's venue like a place of worship.

Mancuso broke unconventional records like "Girl You Need a Change of Mind" 
and "Soul Makossa," yet he was always more of a party engineer than a DJ. 
He put together the best sound system in New York, spending hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on audiophile technology. He treated his dancers to a 
sumptuous buffet of energy-enhancing food and fruit punch. He decorated his 
post-industrial living spaces in the style of a make-believe children's 
party. And he defended his house party setup as if his life depended on it, 
defeating the Department of Consumer Affairs in a precedent-setting battle 
over his right to party without a cabaret license.

The party host also demonstrated a sixth sense for pioneering new 
neighborhoods in which to throw a party. Noho had yet to receive its 
designation when Mancuso moved into 647 Broadway in the mid '60s, and when 
the collapse of a neighboring hotel forced him to look for a new space in 
the summer of 1974, he moved to 99 Prince Street, overcoming the vociferous 
objections of once bohemian locals en route. "Soho vs. Disco" is how Vince 
Aletti, writing in the Voice, framed the clash. Disco won.

Mancuso's next move was calamitous. As his 10-year lease on Prince Street 
drew to a close, he decided to swap the cobbled climes of Soho for the 
virtual war zone of Alphabet City, hopeful that outright ownership of his 
new building on 3rd Street between avenues B and C would help him "leave 
the landlords behind" and ensure the future of his beloved party. Die-hard 
devotees­especially Loft women­balked at the area's notoriously heavy drug 
traffic and endemic crime, however, and even Mancuso became edgy when 
federal and city plans to rejuvenate the area evaporated. "I lost 65 
percent of my attendance overnight," he remembers.

Mancuso struggled in his 3rd Street venue until he was forced to close in 
1994. The itinerant host then tried his luck on Avenue A, followed by 
Avenue B, where a shimmering 28th-anniversary celebration contained the 
promise of rebirth until a fractious landlord forced him into yet another 
move­this time into rented accommodations that were too tiny to hold a 
house party.

The onset of AIDS, the inexorable rise of the drum machine, and the hostile 
tenure of Mayor Giuliani contributed to the impression that Mancuso had 
fallen out of sync with history. But then David Hill, co-owner of 
London-based Nuphonic Records, offered to release a compilation of Loft 
classics, and Mancuso, who needed the money and was impressed by Hill's 
perfectionist drive, agreed. The album, David Mancuso Presents the Loft, 
became Nuphonic's bestseller and triggered a wave of publicity for the club.

As Mancuso's legendary status came into focus, invitations to play in 
Japan, the U.K., Italy, and France poured in. On each trip, the roving 
"musical host" (Mancuso's preferred description) broke with conventional 
DJ'ing practice by agreeing to work with just one promoter and play just 
one party per city. "Most DJs walk into a gig and do a one- to three-hour 
slot, and that is it," he says. "To me that is a fart in a windstorm. I 
like to help build a party from scratch and create a musical direction."

Mancuso recently started to put on parties in what has oddly­given its 
history as the international capital of disco­become the toughest terrain 
of all: New York. Hiring out a hall near St. Marks Place, he has been 
attracting the young (mainly Japanese kids) as well as the old (veterans of 
the Broadway Loft). His 34th-anniversary party in February was a sellout, 
and last weekend's Memorial Day party was equally successful.

Loft babies believe that Mancuso is once again putting on the best party in 
the city. "The best dancing experiences I have ever had have been at the 
Loft," says DJ-producer Nicky Siano, who, having drifted away from the New 
York dance scene in the early 1980s, has made a fairly astonishing comeback 
himself. "The atmosphere at David's parties is second to none."

For some, the Loft has begun to show its age. "I admire David's active 
avoidance of the spotlight, and his parties still have an underground feel 
because of that," says a comparatively young DJ. "But the majority of the 
crowd is the same as it was 20 years ago, and they want to hear the old 
favorites." Others wonder if Mancuso's refusal to use a mixer is 
anachronistic­and if it would be possible for him to pump the sound system 
just a little bit harder.

But if so many new records don't measure up to the old, if mixing 
technology encourages spinners to focus on the micro-detail of how two 
records blend together rather than the broader canvas of the dancefloor 
journey, and if clubbers are suffering from unprecedented levels of 
tinnitus as a result of repeated ear beatings from second-rate sound 
systems, what is Mancuso to do?

The Loft host's obsessive pursuit of the perfect party has emerged as a 
precious antidote to the increasingly stagnant status quo. "The Loft is 
unique and irresistible," says veteran DJ-dancer Danny Krivit, whose 718 
Sessions are one of the hottest parties in the city at the moment. "It's 
about good friends meeting in a homey setting and listening to excellent 
music on a great sound system. The Loft is timeless." Mancuso has become 
not so much an idiosyncratic dinosaur as a prophet from the past who is 
pointing to a new-old future. Just by standing still.

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: A local punk compilation, from a local punk label...

Hey everyone out there in SFR land! 

Wow, it has been a damn long time since I posted on here, but I promise
I still lurk... Anyway, I know this isn't technically rave-related, but
I know a lot of you are fans of the punk-rock stuff. Sooo I thought I'd
take this opportunity to let you know about a local indie label (started
by two local DJs) called Agent Records, who have a new compilation CD
coming out this year. Last years' edition of this CD was really popular
(got air-play on Live105, and tons of college radio stations), and this
one is even better, plus it's super cheap (5 bucks). It's twenty-four
up-and-coming Northern California bands, seventy-four minutes of music,
and more rock than you can shake a formidably sized stick at.

Check it out here: http://www.agentrecords.com/ar03002.html for music
samples, ordering info, and naked pictures of Osby ;)

-Aaron

How Copyright Law Changed Hip Hop

By Kembrew McLeod, <http://www.stayfreemagazine.org>Stay Free! Magazine
June 1, 2004

When Public Enemy released It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back in 
1988, it was as if the album had landed from another planet. Nothing 
sounded like it at the time. It Takes a Nation came frontloaded with 
sirens, squeals, and squawks that augmented the chaotic, collaged backing 
tracks over which P.E. frontman Chuck D laid his politically and poetically 
radical rhymes. He rapped about white supremacy, capitalism, the music 
industry, black nationalism, and – in the case of "Caught, Can I Get a 
Witness?" – digital sampling: "CAUGHT, NOW IN COURT ' CAUSE I STOLE A BEAT 
/ THIS IS A SAMPLING SPORT / MAIL FROM THE COURTS AND JAIL / CLAIMS I STOLE 
THE BEATS THAT I RAIL ... I FOUND THIS MINERAL THAT I CALL A BEAT / I PAID 
ZERO."

In the mid- to late 1980s, hip-hop artists had a very small window of 
opportunity to run wild with the newly emerging sampling technologies 
before the record labels and lawyers started paying attention. No one took 
advantage of these technologies more effectively than Public Enemy, who put 
hundreds of sampled aural fragments into It Takes a Nation and stirred them 
up to create a new, radical sound that changed the way we hear music. But 
by 1991, no one paid zero for the records they sampled without getting 
sued. They had to pay a lot. The following is a combination of two 
interviews conducted separately with Chuck D and Hank Shocklee.

Stay Free!: What are the origins of sampling in hip-hop?

Chuck D: Sampling basically comes from the fact that rap music is not 
music. It's rap over music. So vocals were used over records in the very 
beginning stages of hip-hop. In the late 1980s, rappers were recording over 
live bands who were basically emulating the sounds off of the records. 
Eventually, you had synthesizers and samplers, which would take sounds that 
would then get arranged or looped, so rappers can still do their thing over 
it. The arrangement of sounds taken from recordings came around 1984 to 1989.

Stay Free!: Those synthesizers and samplers were expensive back then, 
especially in 1984. How did hip-hop artists get them if they didn't have a 
lot of money?

Chuck D: Not only were they expensive, but they were limited in what they 
could do – they could only sample two seconds at a time. But people were 
able to get a hold of equipment by renting time out in studios.

Stay Free!: How did the Bomb Squad [Public Enemy's production team, led by 
Shocklee] use samplers and other recording technologies to put together the 
tracks on It Takes a Nation of Millions.

Hank Shocklee:The first thing we would do is the beat, the skeleton of the 
track. The beat would actually have bits and pieces of samples already in 
it, but it would only be rhythm sections. Chuck would start writing and 
trying different ideas to see what worked. Once he got an idea, we would 
look at it and see where the track was going. Then we would just start 
adding on whatever it needed, depending on the lyrics. I kind of 
architected the whole idea. The sound has a look to me, and Public Enemy 
was all about having a sound that had its own distinct vision. We didn't 
want to use anything we considered traditional R&B stuff – bass lines and 
melodies and chord structures and things of that nature.?

Stay Free!: How did you use samplers as instruments?

Chuck D: We thought sampling was just another way of arranging sounds. Just 
like a musician would take the sounds off of an instrument and arrange them 
their own particular way. So we thought we was quite crafty with it.

Shocklee: "Don't Believe the Hype," for example – that was basically played 
with the turntable and transformed and then sampled. Some of the 
manipulation we was doing was more on the turntable, live end of it.

Stay Free!: When you were sampling from many different sources during the 
making of It Takes a Nation, were you at all worried about copyright 
clearance?

Shocklee: No. Nobody did. At the time, it wasn't even an issue. The only 
time copyright was an issue was if you actually took the entire rhythm of a 
song, as in looping, which a lot of people are doing today. You're going to 
take a track, loop the entire thing, and then that becomes the basic track 
for the song. They just paperclip a backbeat to it. But we were taking a 
horn hit here, a guitar riff there, we might take a little speech, a 
kicking snare from somewhere else. It was all bits and pieces.

Stay Free!: Did you have to license the samples in It Takes a Nation of 
Millions before it was released?

Shocklee: No, it was cleared afterwards. A lot of stuff was cleared 
afterwards. Back in the day, things was different. The copyright laws 
didn't really extend into sampling until the hip-hop artists started 
getting sued. As a matter of fact, copyright didn't start catching up with 
us until Fear of a Black Planet. That's when the copyrights and everything 
started becoming stricter because you had a lot of groups doing it and 
people were taking whole songs. It got so widespread that the record 
companies started policing the releases before they got out.

Stay Free!: With its hundreds of samples, is it possible to make a record 
like It Takes a Nation of Millions today? Would it be possible to clear 
every sample?

Shocklee: It wouldn't be impossible. It would just be very, very costly. 
The first thing that was starting to happen by the late 1980s was that the 
people were doing buyouts. You could have a buyout – meaning you could 
purchase the rights to sample a sound – for around $1,500. Then it started 
creeping up to $3,000, $3,500, $5,000, $7,500. Then they threw in this 
thing called rollover rates. If your rollover rate is every 100,000 units, 
then for every 100,000 units you sell, you have to pay an additional 
$7,500. A record that sells two million copies would kick that cost up 
twenty times. Now you're looking at one song costing you more than half of 
what you would make on your album.

Chuck D: Corporations found that hip-hop music was viable. It sold albums, 
which was the bread and butter of corporations. Since the corporations 
owned all the sounds, their lawyers began to search out people who 
illegally infringed upon their records. All the rap artists were on the big 
six record companies, so you might have some lawyers from Sony looking at 
some lawyers from BMG and some lawyers from BMG saying, "Your artist is 
doing this," so it was a tit for tat that usually made money for the 
lawyers, garnering money for the company. Very little went to the original 
artist or the publishing company.

Shocklee: By 1990, all the publishers and their lawyers started making 
moves. One big one was Bridgeport, the publishing house that owns all the 
George Clinton stuff. Once all the little guys started realizing you can 
get paid from rappers if they use your sample, it prompted the record 
companies to start investigating because now the people that they publish 
are getting paid.

Stay Free!: There's a noticeable difference in Public Enemy's sound between 
1988 and 1991. Did this have to do with the lawsuits and enforcement of 
copyright laws at the turn of the decade?

Chuck D: Public Enemy's music was affected more than anybody's because we 
were taking thousands of sounds. If you separated the sounds, they wouldn't 
have been anything – they were unrecognizable. The sounds were all collaged 
together to make a sonic wall. Public Enemy was affected because it is too 
expensive to defend against a claim. So we had to change our whole style, 
the style of It Takes a Nation and Fear of a Black Planet, by 1991.

Shocklee: We were forced to start using different organic instruments, but 
you can't really get the right kind of compression that way. A guitar 
sampled off a record is going to hit differently than a guitar sampled in 
the studio. The guitar that's sampled off a record is going to have all the 
compression that they put on the recording, the equalization. It's going to 
hit the tape harder. It's going to slap at you. Something that's organic is 
almost going to have a powder effect. It hits more like a pillow than a 
piece of wood. So those things change your mood, the feeling you can get 
off of a record. If you notice that by the early 1990s, the sound has 
gotten a lot softer.

Chuck D: Copyright laws pretty much led people like Dr. Dre to replay the 
sounds that were on records, then sample musicians imitating those records. 
That way you could get by the master clearance, but you still had to pay a 
publishing note.

Shocklee: See, there's two different copyrights: publishing and master 
recording. The publishing copyright is of the written music, the song 
structure. And the master recording is the song as it is played on a 
particular recording. Sampling violates both of these copyrights. Whereas 
if I record my own version of someone else's song, I only have to pay the 
publishing copyright. When you violate the master recording, the money just 
goes to the record company.

Chuck D: Putting a hundred small fragments into a song meant that you had a 
hundred different people to answer to. Whereas someone like EPMD might have 
taken an entire loop and stuck with it, which meant that they only had to 
pay one artist.

Stay Free!: So is that one reason why a lot of popular hip-hop songs today 
just use one hook, one primary sample, instead of a collage of different 
sounds?

Chuck D: Exactly. There's only one person to answer to. Dr. Dre changed 
things when he did The Chronic and took something like Leon Haywood's "I 
Want'a Do Something Freaky to You" and revamped it in his own way but 
basically kept the rhythm and instrumental hook intact. It's easier to 
sample a groove than it is to create a whole new collage. That entire 
collage element is out the window.

Shocklee: We're not really privy to all the laws and everything that the 
record company creates within the company. From our standpoint, it was 
looking like the record company was spying on us, so to speak.

Chuck D: The lawyers didn't seem to differentiate between the craftiness of 
it and what was blatantly taken.

Stay Free!: Switching from the past to the present, on the new Public Enemy 
album, Revolverlution, you had fans remix a few old Public Enemy tracks. 
How did you get this idea?

Chuck D: We have a powerful online community through Rapstation.com, 
PublicEnemy.com, Slamjams.com, and Bringthenoise.com. My thing was just 
looking at the community and being able to say, "Can we actually make them 
involved in the creative process?" Why not see if we can connect all these 
bedroom and basement studios, and the ocean of producers, and expand the 
Bomb Squad to a worldwide concept?

Stay Free!: As you probably know, some music fans are now sampling and 
mashing together two or more songs and trading the results online. There's 
one track by Evolution Control Committee that uses a Herb Alpert 
instrumental as the backing track for your "By the Time I Get to Arizona." 
It sounds like you're rapping over a Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass 
song. How do you feel about other people remixing your tracks without 
permission?

Chuck D: I think my feelings are obvious. I think it's great.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] UNSF Declaration of Independence

Peter - great points..

Anyone with any illusions of SF being independent should probably consider
that your problems of homelessness, education, public services, police
corruption and crime will not just "stop" - Also, you think your sport teams
will stay? hell no, they would move to another city. Who would want to be a
part of the "fundamentalists" in SF, or for that matter United SF? So in
that regard there goes a source of major city revenue. What about local
business? Or for that matter, what about large business? I just can't see
these people sticking around. Should this go through, which I have the
highest doubts of anyone, you would be setting SF back 100's of years. Think
about how bad the US would tax the shit out of you guys to get your water,
electricity, etc. ...umm Gas prices anyone?!??! SF does not have the
greatest amounts of independent resources.

I am of the opinion that the US is in the business of adding land and
resources to it collection, not letting them secede.

Also, let's just say the it does go through, I can't imagine you believe
that you are just going to inherit whatever monetary resources that
currently exist for SF? Nope those would become the property of the US. And
raising bridge toll to $10 ain't gonna make up for it. Well for that matter,
I guess you wouldn't get any of the bridge toll; The bridges are owned by
the good ol US of A.

I know the people that are planning this probably have put some thought into
it...and I don't mean to hate on ya'll...but you can't just secede from the
US. Peter hits it right on the head, face your problems head on, don't just
run away to start over. Take people trying to add a respected third party
the election system....how long have they been at it? How much farther do
they have to go? Even if SF was a perfect utopia and you wanted this to
happen you are still talking decades of swaying public opinion...you need a
few more than 100 people to do this.

Good idea folks, but just never gonna happen...also who are you gonna turn
to when the terrorists attack? You have no military. You gonna bargain with
'em? Arm the homeless? You think cause your not with the US, you still don't
represent Christian, Western civilization? Not everyone out there lives
plur. Most can't even spell it ;)

     I'm confused... was this a proposal that SF would become independant of 
the US politically, or was this a proposal for SF to go to friggin war with 
US??? i mean just because a city proposed to become independant of a country 
politically doesn't mean that the country will boycott us and abandon us from all 
utilities and military defense when/if needed. look how well we treat canada, 
we trade with them all the time and if they are in trouble who's got their 
back? the US of course. i'm sure if SF somehow (althought i can't see how this 
could possibly happen) became an independent, the rest of the US would just 
roll their eyes and laugh at our leftist ways. but when push did come to shove 
and people were in trouble here, they would take us back in with a, "i told you 
so" and a slap on the wrist.      You guys make it sound like we're doomed to 
death if we did something like this. I think it's a valid proposal but i just 
don't think the majority of the population in SF really agrees with this. Yes 
there were millions of protestors here but they came from all over the place. 
SF seems to be a major hot spot for going against the grain, but when i hang 
out in the city and drive around go shopping at the mall, grab a bite to eat 
and what not, you look at those big corparate buildings downtown, you look at 
all the kids at SFSU and UCSF and you see tons of fearful people who are just as 
comformist as everyone else in the US.   They all have a republican club, the 
majority of em probably voted for arnold, aside from the haight district i 
don't see a maroity of people in SF or any city for that matter having the 
audasity to create a declration of independance from the rest of the US. 
     i do, however think it's a very cool idea and i don't agree that we'd 
have such disasterous problems with utilities and military protection against 
terrorist attacks etc.   look at the friggin places that terrorist DO attack; 
the world trade center (stocks) <--- evil, the pentagon (big government) <---- 
evil. there are reasons terrorists attack the places that they attack. a city 
that has just declared independance from the US is the safest place in the 
world to live in as far as terrorist attacks are concerned. terrorist don't attack 
places just becuse they can, they attack places that they feel are so wrong 
that it's worth giving up their life to take it down. I don't see how becoming 
independant as a city would cause the US to boycott us and change anything in 
the way things are traded in and out of the city, we're not declaring war on 
the US, we're not boycotting them, it sounds like they proposing being 
independant politically as in policies and ideogies and beliefs. if that's the case it 
sound like a great idea. but still... go walk around SF go every where and 
take a lil survery in your head, i bet you at least 6 out of every 10 people in 
this city are conformists who will not stick up for such a radical policy.   
conformists are everywhere fear is everywhere sadly enough, even on this list.

DOH!!!
A bit busy down at the station, so I've TOTALLY slacked in letting folks
know about the show today.  We just finished up with aqui_no's portion
of the show, and are just beginning Koroma's set.  Which means more
BANGIN' 3am house is heading your way!!  If you're near a radio, or feel
like listening in online, tune in to 90.1 FM, or click to

Peace!!

Club Six presenté

Juan Atkins
at <http://www.illstatic.com/venue_list.php?venue=Six#top>Six
9:00pm until 4am
21+ / $15

The Legends of House series returns featuring the shoguns of underground 
electronica battling it out for the hearts and minds of underground masses.

Representing the Detroit Techno Shogunate: Juan Atkins -- the godfather of 
Techno Juan Atkins truly is a legend in his own time. Appearing behind 
aliases such as Cybotron, Model 500 and Infiniti, he has released many 
classics of sublime Detroit techno, including the 1982 electro track 
"Clear." Recorded by Atkins and Rick Davis as Cybotron, this track is often 
considered the first proto-techno track. Experimenting with fusing the 
extra-terrestrial funk of Parliament Funkadelic with the futuristic rhythms 
and hard math of Kraftwerk , the Model 500 12"s laid the blueprint for 
Detroit Techno.

Along with the tracks made by two schoolmates from the grade below, Derrick 
May and Kevin Saunderson, Detroit Techno quickly made its way across the 
Atlantic and immediately sparked the emerging rave culture and soon after 
the entire global dance community. Moving through the later 80's as Model 
500, Atkins continued as one of the most prolific and sought after 
producers of electronic music throughout the 90's, culminating in the use 
of an Atkins' original as the musical bed for the 2000 launch of the Ford 
Focus 'Detroit Techno' automobile.

Along with:
Jesse Saunders The orginator of House
Andrew Jervis (Ubiquity Records, The Friday Night Sessions)
Dusty Crates (Electric Soul)
David Jeromin
and a rare opening set by Angel (b-day boy and club 6 owner)

'JUST SAY NO' ADS DON'T WORK
<http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/front/2595607>http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/front/2595607 


SK BARDWELL, HOUSTON CHRONICLE - Anti-drug ads, which the government plans 
to spend $145 million to produce this fiscal year, do little to dissuade 
young people from taking drugs, according to research conducted by Texas 
State University at San Marcos psychology professors. Even worse, the ads 
may actually prompt some teens to experiment with drugs -- a reaction 
diametrically opposite that sought by the White House Office of National 
Drug Policy.

The study, which researchers will present Friday at a meeting of the 
American Psychological Society in Chicago, is part of a larger, ongoing 
project sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project, a national marijuana 
policy reform organization. . .

Three of every four students reported the ads sparked thoughts that ran 
counter to the ads' message, the study showed. "For example, in response to 
ads linking drug use to the war on terror, the most frequent unanticipated 
thoughts were that marijuana should be legalized, the war on drugs has been 
ineffective, and that marijuana users should grow their own," said Czyzewska.

Well, if the Xians can have their own state, we should certainly work at 
building our own City State.  Think Amsterdam on steroids...

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: [sfraves] Safe & The Top?

Does anyone know if Safe at The Top is still going on Saturday nights?
It used to be promoted as a weekly 2-step/UK garage event, but I don't
see e-mails or web sites mentioning it anymore. If it's still happening,
anyone know what the schedule's like for the next few weeks?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Ball Pythons for sale!

I have two fat and happy Ball Pythons for sale. I'm pretty certain they're 
both males, but I'm by far not a snake expert, and I'm not really willing ot 
probe them to find out otherwise. I received them both (separately) as 
gifts, and they've been together for about 3 & 1/2 years now (with no 
babies). So either they're both really males, or they're both females (or 
they can't have kids, lol).

The older of the two is Jake, he's approx. 5 + years old. He was rescued 
from an engine block two years before I got him, and he was a little bigger 
than most Ball Python babies.

The younger is Nugget. I got him as a baby.

Neither snake has had any health issues of any kind. Jake had one bad shed 
when I first got him, but a little bath in warm water took care of it, and 
he hasn't had an issue since.

They live together in a 100 gallon tank, but feed separately (I have a small 
tank for Nugget to go into when they feed). They both eat rats - Jake can 
eat up to a medium (as long as it's not huge), and Nugget still eats small 
rats.

I am selling them together, with both tanks, a heat rock, an old heating 
pad, and wooden thingies they use to hang out on/hide under for $75. They're 
up on Craigslist right now for more - but for the SFR community I'll drop 
the price.

Anyway - if you're interested, or have any questions regarding these little 
guys, hit me off list!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Tiesto Tonight - Ruby Skye !!!

Why don't people dig on Tinrib style trance these days?  Maybe it's the same 
reason you don't like Tiesto?  It's always interesting to me to see people 
who think the music they listen to are the "right" kinds, and all others are 
"fucking wank-off lofty *fill in your desired genre here* crap".  it always 
bothered me that people diss on whatever music.  just because you don't like 
it, doesn't mean its crap.  that goes the same for hip-hop, electronic, 
country, whatever u can think of.

music is a form of expression, and how can you judge expression?  what makes 
your form of expression better than anyone's? just because?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tiesto Tonight - Ruby Skye !!!

It really amazes me how many people get irritated when someone else states
their OPINION.

I never said it was word of god, nor is my shitty opinion better than anyone
elses. If you take it to heart, maybe the shoe fits?

Tiesto still (IMHO) sucks ass.

Build a bridge and get over it.

particular.  Just music in general.  Like Country music.  I don't listen to 
it, don't dig it, don't get it.  But somehow it still bugs me when some 
individuals blurt out "Why do people listen to that crap?"  But hey, 
everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I'm just gonna go build that bridge 
of mine and get over it :)

It's because all these jaded ass ravers burnt themselves out on a couple 
years of cheese trance and ecky during trance's heydey. Now they think of 
themselves as having "outgrown" it. :) There's a certain headspace in which 
that kind of trance makes sense... And that  headspace is pretty rare these 
days.

This is an age of war and blood. Peaceful music doesn't synch with the 
collective unconscious.

...love the stuff myself.

Subject: [sfraves] let's try this again....VOTE FOR BUSH! haha

sorry bout the first email...but ya that was funny because meybe there are 
NO reasons why anyone should vote for bush (from the blank email). blah just 
read....hehe
------------------

Here's a few dozen reasons to vote for the G.

George W. Bush
The White House, USA

EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:


LAW ENFORCEMENT:

I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the 
influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's 
license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been "lost" and 
is not available.


MILITARY:

I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a 
drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas 
Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.


COLLEGE:

I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.


PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:

I ran for U.S. Congress and lost.

I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought 
an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. The company went 
bankrupt shortly after I so ld all my stock.

I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took and 
using taxpayer money.

With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry 
(including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.


ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:

I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making 
Texas the most polluted state in the Union.

During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city 
in America.

I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in 
borrowed money.

I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American 
history.

With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's 
appointments to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by over 
500,000 votes.


ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:

I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office wi th a criminal 
record.

I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one 
Billion dollars per week.

I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury.

I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.

I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month 
period.

I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.

I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any 
administration in U.S. history.

My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named 
after her.

I set the record for most campaign fundraising trips by a U.S. President.

I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most 
corporate campaign donations.

My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends, 
Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. 
Histo ry, Enron.

My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure 
my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.

I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation 
or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica 
Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest 
corporate rip-offs in history.

I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to 
intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.

I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.

I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded 
government contracts.

I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in 
U.S. history.

I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the 
history of the United States government.

I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.

I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove 
the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.

I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.

I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. "prisoners of war" detainees 
and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.

I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election 
inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).

I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President 
since the advent of television.

I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period.

After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the worst 
security failure in U.S. history.

I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center 
attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country n 
the world, the largest failure of diplomac y in world history.

I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously 
protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for 
protest against any person in the history of mankind.

I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, preemptive 
attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against 
the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world 
community.

I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty 
benefits for active duty troops and their families -- in war time.

In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking 
Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends.

I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) 
view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.

I am supporting development of a nuclear "Tactical Bunker Buster," a WMD.< 
BR>
I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to 
justice.


RECORDS AND REFERENCES:

All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's 
library, sealed and unavailable for public view.

All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt 
companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.

All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended 
regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for 
public review.


PLEASE CONSIDER MY EXPERIENCE WHEN VOTING IN 2004.

For the record - I still like some trance, just not THAT kind of trance. I
find it to be the EDM equivalent of stuff like Christina Aguilera -
sickeningly sweet fluff.

But if it gets you off, I say listen away!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Tiesto Review - Ruby Skye !!!

This marked my 4th time to Ruby.. seems to keep getting more expensive.. but 
the door and security rocks.. so no complaints for a club.. I can see why 
SF'rs rate it #1.  So there I am in the #1 club.. seeing #1 DJ.. amazing.  
The place was packed and it's huge, and everyone is f*cking eye candy.. I 
danced for about 5 hours straight.. off the freakin' chain.

Ruby Ske's sounds system is really amazing to me.. I didn't fully understand 
it at first.. the front stage was definitely consuming, and imaged well.. 
but the balance was odd from hight to low.. and as I started walking around 
to differnt sections it came togethet for me.. the Bass tubes or run along 
the stair cases in the back.. so that the bass can reverberate up the back 
cornsers.. fills the top and then echos forward.. which works for such a 
large space.  When you are on the main floor center.. the imaging of the 
highs comes off really loud.. but fills well with mids that hit from the 
front corners ointing forward.. as it should be.  The best sound is thus 
center rear and the lfloating light stantion(sp?) is killer.. that loopy 
thing drops and swirls and bathes people in light.. at one point I remember 
everyone raising ther hands into the light and swirling like ringlets of 
hair in the fingers.

The crowd was so beautifull.. I met a Brazillian girl from Miami that came 
here just to see tiesto spin.. I think she was a groupie.. she had all the 
after party digs and was amazing looking, and sweet.. imagine that!  
Everyone was rollin.. but noone was puddling.. ahh the adults at play, a 
fine sight indeed.  So much love and soo many people.. how does that work?

Anyway.. the intro dj DJ Bali was a little slow.. but when it came time for 
the hand-off and the crowd started chanting Tiesto.. Tiesto!!  I couldn't 
help but feel like Tiesto would have to hit the decks hard.. Bali's last 30 
minutes were sick as hell.. hard hitting tracks that had everyone jumpin.. 
Tiesto hit a little slow at first so it was alright.. but off a bit.. then 
his set from 1:30-3am was crazy.. mad skills, all over the boards.. slappin 
records.. really interacting with the crowd.  He is quite the DJ's DJ.  As 
usuall I was right up front.. it was crowded.. you had to leave now and 
again to do some real dancing, or assert some space.. but everyone let 
everyone take their turns to get their groove on and made way.. it was phat. 
  I was usually surrounded by beautiful wemon shaking their thang.. so no 
complaints their either :)

All in all I give Tiesto a 9 for small venue performance, and 8 on track 
selection, an 8 on mix effects and audience interaction, and overall a 9 for 
satisfaction.   I have to admit their was a lot of new stuff he broke out.. 
but the best tracks were the classics.  I would go see tiesto spin anytime.

Hey Ibizza Aug 2005.. if anyone else is going let me know.. I am going to 
try and do a time share.

Square, 2:30PM.

In conjunction with the Free City Movement and the Reclaim the Commons 
Mobilization, the 100th Monkey is inviting you, your friends, and even 
your enemies to come join us as we declare our independence. At 
approximately 2:30PM, stand with your fellow brothers and sister of the 
United Neighborhoods of San Francisco, and sign the Declaration of 
Independence. Come dressed for making history in whatever costume or 
lack thereof feels right to you -- and help us make history. A new 
world is possible and we pledge to make it real!

  The text of the declaration can be found at:

OH SO TRUE!!!  Sometimes when I get to the Stickman drunk stage, my
animosity towards them grows and I start coming up with ideas for saving
things.  I mean, we can't set up map points for everyone entering the
city or anything! :)  So the drunken thought that comes to mind is that
all the freaks, and all the lovers of the SF style should be as unwelcoming
as necessary to the invading horde.

Anyone have any more constructive ideas??? :)

BUSY WEEKEND IN THE CRUZ...

We are taking SEISMIC to the Beach for an all night
bender of Breaks and such next weekend. This is the
Beach party of the summer that is not to be missed!

Join us on June 5th at Red White and Blue Beach in
Santa Cruz as we bring out the Big Outdoor Sound and
spark up the bonfire and fire dancers under the almost
full moon.

For any of you who have not been to Red White and Blue
Beach, you are in for quite a treat. It is private
campground about 6 miles north of Santa Cruz off of
Route 1. The folks who own it are kind enough to let
us set up in a beautiful spot that is surrounded by
dunes/hills that protect from the wind and the
elements.

We will be laying down the Bass Heavy Beats from
Sunrise to Sunset so bring your party shoes. It is
going to be one hell of a night.

Red White and Blue Beach is located at 5021 Coast Road
Santa Cruz CA 95060. Look for a red, white, and blue
mailbox at Scaroni Road near milepost 24.9. Go down
the Scaroni Road about a 1/4 mile. The campground
charges a $15 camping fee.

Bring:
warm clothes
sleeping bag and/or tent
booze
food
etc.

DJs include:
Murphstar - (Tactility, SEISMIC)
Benchun (False Profit, Samurai Soundsystem)
Brett Pinkin
Tyler Reed (Grand Champion Sound)
Samira (Sister SF)
Captain Morris
and more to be announced.

I look forward to seeing you all at the Beach!

Saturday, June 5, 2004 ** Legends of House 11.0 vs. Legends of Techno v1.0 =
Battle of the Shoguns **

Legends of House 11.0 vs. Legends of Techno v1.0
Battle of the Shoguns

JUAN ATKINS vs. JESSE SAUNDERS
The Legends of House series returns featuring the
shoguns of underground electronica battling it out for
the hearts and minds of underground masses.

Representing the Detroit Techno Shogunate: Juan Atkins
-- the godfather of Techno
Juan Atkins truly is a legend in his own time.
Appearing behind aliases such as Cybotron, Model 500
and Infiniti, he has released many classics of sublime
Detroit techno, including the 1982 electro track
"Clear." Recorded by Atkins and Rick Davis as
Cybotron, this track is often considered the first
proto-techno track. Experimenting with fusing the
extra-terrestrial funk of Parliament Funkadelic with
the futuristic rhythms and hard math of Kraftwerk ,
the Model 500 12"s laid the blueprint for Detroit
Techno.

Along with the tracks made by two schoolmates from the
grade below, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson, Detroit
Techno quickly made its way across the Atlantic and
immediately sparked the emerging rave culture and soon
after the entire global dance community. Moving
through the later 80's as Model 500, Atkins continued
as one of the most prolific and sought after producers
of electronic music throughout the 90's, culminating
in the use of an Atkins' original as the musical bed
for the 2000 launch of the Ford Focus 'Detroit Techno'
automobile.

Along with:
Jesse Saunders The orginator of House
Andrew Jervis (Ubiquity Records, The Friday Night
Sessions)
Dusty Crates (Electric Soul)
David Jeromin
and a rare opening set by Angel (b-day boy and club 6
owner) With artwork in the lounge from: Adam Feibelman, Anita Brey, Calder =

Bio: MAURICIO AVILES
Born in the capitol of El Salvador in 1969, Mauricio Aviles immigrated with=
 his parents to San Francisco, California in 1973. Growing up in the Missio=
n District, he was constantly surrounded by the latin rhythms of the barrio=
=2E His father had a company that produced theatrical and musical events th=
at featured 'la cultura latina', and eventually Mauricio became involved wi=
th his father's creative enterprise, helping to produce several festivals a=
nd concerts in the Bay Area. The people and the music of this period provid=
ed the foundation for Mauricio's involvement in the City's burgeoning dance=
 scene that evolved throughout the 90's.
As a dj Mauricio's first actual gigs began at the City's bastion of undergr=
ound vibration, the EndUp. As a protege of Arron Olivares, Mauricio began f=
orming his own sounds and creating a devoted following that are still with =
him today. His next regular residencies were simultaneously Corazon, a lati=
n flavored weekly in the heart of the Mission District, and Metrojazz a ver=
y popular and original weekend event that successfully combined down tempo,=
 abstract beats and house, a hybrid that would eventually become to describ=
e the 'San Francisco Sound'.   Acknowledging the urban, afro origins of dan=
ce music, with a personal blend of his own latino roots, and a constant end=
eavor to break new ground, Mauricio's sound is hauntingly personal, emotion=
al and consistently fresh. Creating a niche within the deep house sound, hi=
s style, though ethereal, is undeniably funky and always elicits a great re=
sponse on the dance floor.  Now with an internationally successful compilat=
ion under his belt (Naked Music's Nude Dimension II), Mauricio has begun hi=
s production career with a debut single slated for release in Summer 2001. =
As an emissary for Naked Music, Mauricio has also commenced a global tour, =
ensuring that America's hottest new dance label is well represented.  Mauri=
cio has of late done production work and dj=92d under the moniker of MOVIDO=
, his project with collaborator and Loveslap label founder Charles Spencer.

Bio: DAVID HARNESS
In 1990, David began DJ'ing in his hometown of Monterey, California, at the=
 After Dark. As his popularity grew past the boundaries of Monterey, he was=
 invited to establish a residency at Tilt, and Sound Factory, in San Franci=
sco. In 1992, as David's popularity continued to grow he, along with DJ, Ru=
ben Mancias and promoter Joseph Solis opened a hip and popular club, Lift, =
at Club Dv8. David joined Bay Area legendary DJ, Pete Avila and host Foxxee=
 Brown on 'Your Mama's House', on the Bay Area's popular radio station KMEL=
 FM. Being the only "true" house mix show on any Northern California radio =
station, DJ's David Harness, Pete Avila and host Foxxee Brown have played a=
 key role in furthering House Music in the Bay Area. Also during that year,=
 David established a residency at San Francisco's legendary Club Universe. =
David Harness has quickly become one of the most well known and popular DJ'=
s in the San Francisco Bay Area club scene. David's popularity continued to=
 soar, taking him around the world; and the opportunity to play with New Yo=
rk's Legendary DJ's, Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, Little Louie Vega, T=
edd Patterson, Dave Morales, London's Ricky Morrison, Danny Teneglia, Marqu=
es Wyatt- to name a few. He has appeared in articles and interviews in Bill=
board Magazine, Paper Magazine, Surface, XLR8R, Urb, Streetsounds, Sweater,=
 HX, Next and the Bay Guardian.



Bio: LOVEWORKS
Add a large helping of deep underground house music with a side of funk, a =
heap of disco, and a hint of techno, and you have the most nutritious dance=
floor experience available in San Francisco. Initially conceived by Dianna =
Jacobs and Nori Castillo of Toontown /  Carefree fame in the summer of '96,=
 Loveworks was envisioned as a refuge from the monotony of local clubs and =
superficial music, and  has become one of the bay area's most well known ni=
ghts out, while somehow remaining one it's best kept secrets.  It exists to=
 unite people of any race, social status or sexuality together in a comfort=
able and friendly club environment with music as the focal point, and in ad=
dition to it's monthly parties at the Minna Gallery, Loveworks also teams u=
p with other like minded parties around the city and has been featured at c=
lubs and parties such as Liquid, the Top, Electric, and the Endup.  Besides=
 late night dancing, Loveworks has also been involved in events for Wired M=
agazine, Apple Computer, Sony Digital, Construct Internet Design, and a hos=
t of others. Loveworks also had the honor of winning the SF Bay Guardian=92=
s =91 BEST HOUSE CLUB =91 in 1999.


Bio: 111 MINNA GALLERY
111 Minna Gallery is a dynamic =91contemporary art salon=92 that provides a=
n arena for multi-dimensional artistic expression in a community atmosphere=
=2E The goal of the =91gallery-as salon=92 concept is to nurture and suppor=
t a communal gathering of artists and a collaboration between diverse art f=
orms. This goal is achieved through six-week rotations of visual art exhibi=
tions curated by the staff combined with a variety of music and film events=
=2E =91Minna=92 is not only the name of the street on which the gallery is =
found but also translates from Japanese as "everybody," an all-inclusive te=
rm that symbolizes the embracing environment of the space. The gallery, whi=
ch also offers two bars, is crafted in an eclectic, contemporary design wit=
h ample furniture inviting guests to leisurely relax and enjoy conversation=
 among friends. The combination of art, music, film, dance and conversation=
 found at 111 Minna Gallery creates a unique gathering place for a multi-se=

Subject: [sfraves] Juan

Wow.  What is it that they say; that if you come into something with
high expectations you're usually disappointed???  Well, maybe the fact
that I heard Koroma do his thing before I heard Juan do HIS thing left a
bit of an impression, but I seriously didn't feel that J. A. was putting
much effort forward.  Was Club 6 too small a venue for him??  Was I the
only one who felt this way??  I'd seriously give 70-80% of the folks
I've had on the show better marks than what I heard tonight.

How's that for keeping it real??

Subject: [sfraves] NRR News: Proposed Legislation: Military Draft of 2005

Military Draft expected to start June 15, 2005

If there are children in your family, READ this.

There is pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills: S 89 and
HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft can begin at
early as Spring 2005 -- just after the 2004 presidential election. The
administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while the
public's attention is on the elections, so our action on this is needed
immediately.

See the following websites to view Bills:
http://www.hslda.org/legislation


Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and HR 163 forward,entitled the
Universal National Service Act of 2003, "to provide for the common defense
by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the United States,
including women, perform a period of military service or a period of
civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland
security, and for other purposes." These active bills currently sit in the
committee on armed services.

Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam era.
College and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada and the
U.S. signed a "smart border declaration," which could be used to keep wou
ld-be draft dodgers in. Signed by Canada's minister of foreign aff airs,
John Manley, and U.S. Homeland Security director, Tom Ridge, the
declaration involves a 30-point plan which implements, among other things,
a "pre-clearance agreement" of people entering and departing each country.
Reforms aimed at making the draft more equitable along gender and class
lines also eliminates higher education as a shelter.
Underclassmen would only be able to postpone service until the end of
their current semester. Seniors would have until the end of the academic
year.

This plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as a shelter
and includes women in the draft.

Actions, actions, actions:
Please send this on to all the parents and teachers you know, and all the
aunts and uncles, grandparents, godparents.... And let your children know
- it's their future, and they can be a powerful voice for change!

Please also contact your representatives to ask them! why they aren't
telling their constituents about these bills -- and contact newspapers and
other media outlets to ask them why they're not covering this important
story.

The draft $28 million has been added to the 2004 selective service system
(sss) budget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as
June 15, 2005. Selective Service must report to Bush on March 31, 2005
that the system, which has lain dormant for decades, is ready for
activation.

Please see website: http://www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html
to view the sss annual performance plan - fiscal year 2004.

The pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 draft
board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide. Though this is
an unpopular election year topic, military experts and influential members
of congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld's prediction of a "long, hard
slog" in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a permanent state of war on
"terrorism"] proves accurate, the U.S. may have no choice but to draft.

http://www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html


WHAT TO DO:
- Tell all your friends!!!!!
Contact your Senators & Reps and tell them to oppose these bills!!! For
the full list of Senate & House Representatives (53) and websites, go to:
http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/cgi-bin/newseek.cgi?site=ctc&state=ca!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR News: Proposed Legislation: Military Draft of 2005

Military Draft expected to start June 15, 2005

If there are children in your family, READ this.

There is pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills: S 89 and
HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft can begin at
early as Spring 2005 -- just after the 2004 presidential election. The
administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while the
public's attention is on the elections, so our action on this is needed
immediately.

See the following websites to view Bills:
http://www.hslda.org/legislation


Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and HR 163 forward,entitled the
Universal National Service Act of 2003, "to provide for the common defense
by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the United States,
including women, perform a period of military service or a period of
civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland
security, and for other purposes." These active bills currently sit in the
committee on armed services.

Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam era.
College and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada and the
U.S. signed a "smart border declaration," which could be used to keep wou
ld-be draft dodgers in. Signed by Canada's minister of foreign aff airs,
John Manley, and U.S. Homeland Security director, Tom Ridge, the
declaration involves a 30-point plan which implements, among other things,
a "pre-clearance agreement" of people entering and departing each country.
Reforms aimed at making the draft more equitable along gender and class
lines also eliminates higher education as a shelter.
Underclassmen would only be able to postpone service until the end of
their current semester. Seniors would have until the end of the academic
year.

This plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as a shelter
and includes women in the draft.

Actions, actions, actions:
Please send this on to all the parents and teachers you know, and all the
aunts and uncles, grandparents, godparents.... And let your children know
- it's their future, and they can be a powerful voice for change!

Please also contact your representatives to ask them! why they aren't
telling their constituents about these bills -- and contact newspapers and
other media outlets to ask them why they're not covering this important
story.

The draft $28 million has been added to the 2004 selective service system
(sss) budget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as
June 15, 2005. Selective Service must report to Bush on March 31, 2005
that the system, which has lain dormant for decades, is ready for
activation.

Please see website: http://www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html
to view the sss annual performance plan - fiscal year 2004.

The pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 draft
board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide. Though this is
an unpopular election year topic, military experts and influential members
of congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld's prediction of a "long, hard
slog" in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a permanent state of war on
"terrorism"] proves accurate, the U.S. may have no choice but to draft.

http://www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html


WHAT TO DO:
- Tell all your friends!!!!!
Contact your Senators & Reps and tell them to oppose these bills!!! For

I wasn't there but I saw Juan Atkins spin following

cleared the floor. (May filled it.)

  of 2005

Most fear mongering bills have passed easily.  Patriot Act anyone?  These 
two bills were introduced on the same day - January 3rd, 2003.  1.5 years, 
and they're still in committee?  If it was serious, it would've been pushed 
through already.

 From what I hear, the armed forces are exceeding their current recruitment 
quotas while being rather selective with applicants.  Doesn't seem to be a 
need for a draft right now unless we are planning a few more wars of 
liberation.

Juan was an innovative producer, but never IMHO a good dancefloor DJ.  His 
track selection was interesting last night but he doesn't seem to be able 
to build a set and keep the dancers moving.  We left after about an hour 
into his performance.  Jesse, however, just seems to get better and better.

Love,

She IS pretty damn good. A 3 deck techno rockin' lady is thumbs up in my 
book any day. Does Heather Hart ever come through here? She rocks some 
pretty decent shit too.

While we're on the subject - have any of the foloowing ever been through, or 
are they going to roll through?

I belive Greg brought Adam Beyer for his Thursday night thingy at 1015 a few 
years back. SLS, Christian Smith, and Trevor Rockliffe too I believe.

Umek. No way, I would have been there. One of these days... ;-)

Chirs and Julian Liberator have both been here more than once. They're just 
OK in my book.

I've been stoked lately on Oxia, Likatek, and Henrik B as far as tech house
goes.  But I'm not a big fan of Umek.  :\

Oh boy oh boy oh boy... this has made me look forward to this album muy
MUY mucho.  When is it coming out?  How'd you get an early copy?  Orbital
2 (the Brown Album) is a supreme classic, and "The Box" (on In Sides) is
one of the tunes that got me into "electronica" in the first place.  So
sad that the Hartnolls are quitting.  =(

Don't worry, the Hartnoll's have some awesome side work planned...

The Blue Album promos have been in circulation for some time...you owe it to yourself to buy this album when it comes out...definitely the best Orbital album since Snivilisation.

Saw them live twice, 1999 in SF and 1996 in Chicago.
The show in Chicago was like orgasm sledgehammer to
the side of the head. Sent me tumbling sideways etc.
The 99 show was like shrug.

Sure as hell hope this new album lives up to the hype.
They've been doing a lot of film scores recently, and
instead of any live shows, just one of the two has
been DJing here and there.

Skeptical.


Giles

Subject: [sfraves] BAILEY @ SOMA Sessions - Fri June 25

SOMA Sessions
Drum 'n Bass Fourth Fridays
AsiaSF, San Francisco, USA
http://www.somasessions.com

SOMA Sessions is San Francisco's premier weekend
Jungle/Drum 'n Bass party.  On every Fourth Friday we
invite leading hand-picked DJ talents from around the
globe to play extended sets in an intimate setting
which forms the idea of the "session"...


Friday June 25, 2004

BAILEY (Metalheadz, Swerve, Breakbeat Science - UK)
Bailey's roots in Drum & Bass stretch back to the
early days of UK pirate radio. A talented DJ whose
taste and selection span all styles of the genre, he
quickly became one of the premier DJs of the D&B
movement. In 1996 he took a residency at Goldie's
renowned Metalheadz night at the legendary Blue Note.
Over the years he has established his own radio show
every Sunday on BBC 1Xtra and joined Fabio's famous
Swerve night in London. A favorite of the San
Francisco scene, if you can't get down to this DJ you
may be dead.

Why: Because us American's can't seem to get it regularly, so why not have a festival and binge!
Where: The Bistro 1001 B St. Hayward Ca. - Starts at noon.
How: Well you can drive or take bart to the Hayward exit (NOT south hayward). The bistro is 2 blocks east on B St.

Why Not?

Subject: [sfraves] For sale: Pair of 15-foot handmade banners (originally designed for
 DNA Lounge)

Hi everyone.  I am selling a pair of 15-foot banners I designed for 
:CODE at DNA Lounge (but they'll work anywhere with a high ceiling).

Here's some pictures:
http://www.iamthedj.com/banners/

If you know any promoters there who might be interested, please let me 
know!  I'm asking $100, or best offer.  These took me nine hours to 
make, not to mention to the cost of materials.

- The :C logo on each is removable, the logo is on it's own fabric
- Two banners, 15' tall each
- Handmade, two tier, with lined red velvet triangle flap at the top
- Hangs with six 60-cent dowels and rigs easily into lighting truss or 
other ceiling fixtures

Any leads appreciated.  Thanks!

 >:)Amber

Jack Dangers - what more needs to be said? I remember seeing Meat Beat way 
back in like '88 - '89 when they toured with NIN & Consolidated for the 99% 
tour - they were SICK.

I think today I'ma bust out my "Storm The Studio" EP for shits and 
giggles....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] voice software

You mean Stephen *HAW*king?

Erm- I use TextAloud MP3, but there's a bunch out there-

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=%2B%22text+to+speech%22+%2Bfreeware&btnG=Google+Search

An interesting note about Steven Hawking- his text-to-speech stuff is so 
old it's based in hardware.
Apparently it's in need of replacement, but the actual hardware and 
components don't exist anymore and like an analog synthesizer, software 
reproductions just can't capture his "voice" exactly...

You need Reader 6.0 or newer,

"View" menu->"Read Aloud"->"This page only"

or

"View" menu->"Read Aloud"->"To end of document"

You must have text-to-speech services installed which means Macintalk Pro in Mac 7.5-9.2,
Text-to-Speech in Mac OS 10.1 or newer and MS Text-to-Speech Agent in Windows ME/2000 (builtin to
XP)

good luck

Hey if you guys haven't checked this out, it's worth a listen! Little
trancey for 'ol jackie, but mad respect to Steve for not only creating the
tracks but putting out a mixset with it as well, very junkie-xl-esque!

I like a lot of the stuff steve puts out and always like to introduce it to
the crowd when the cd decks are around.

2 thumbs up!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Biotech Bullsh*t

This weekend, when I first heard about the protests going on about that 
biotech conference, I was rather inclined to think the protesters were 
a bunch of knuckleheads, who should be ignored more than anything else. 
  They seem to have two main arguements.  First, they argue that 
corporations profit from biotech, therefore it is evil.  *GASP* Horror 
of horrors.... well.... DUH!!!!  Now, I'll be the first to call for the 
heads of everyone at enron, halliburton, microsoft, and the like, to be 
impaled on pikes.  But dammit, it's bad deeds that cause a corporation 
to be "evil", not the act of incorporation itself.  Second is some 
ignorant scaremongering about the dangers of biotech that sound more 
like luddite superstition more than rational scientific discourse.

Today, after seeing what's happening on the streets of San Francisco, 
I'm steadfastly on the side of the protesters.

No doubt the behest of the biotech bigwigs, 'da Mayor has had the pigs 
basically excise a large chunk of SOMA from The City, cutting off all 
access to PUBLIC roads and PUBLIC sidewalks to all except the attendees 
of a conference put on by PRIVATE interests.  And many blocks 
surrounding the Moscone Center look like a bad '80s movie about life 
behind the "iron curtain", they're so swarming with the filth.  Well, 
an "iron curtain" HAS descended upon San Francisco, and it's got "SFPD" 
embroidered on every swatch of cloth.

Just like they went goosestepping through the streets, a year ago, to 
beat people up for having the "wrong" opinion about the war in Iraq, 
the MFers have decided that the conference attendees are too delicate 
to be exposed to the "wrong" opinions, and there are reports of said 
wrongly-opinioned being harassed, arrested, manhandled, and even 
beaten.  The public is being denied access to the roads and sidewalks 
we paid for.  Traffic is a nightmare.  And if you want to walk through 
SOMA, you have to detour around the area that the pigs have decided is 
sacrosanct, suitable to be walked upon only if you're in the biotech 
industry.

Though I may believe that the opinions of the protesters were ignorant 
superstition, they damn well have the right to that opinion, and they 
have the right to let people know they have that opinion, and they 
should not be persecuted for it.  And otherwise uninvolved third 
parties DAMN WELL should NOT be, in any way, hassled, diverted, or 
otherwise inconvenienced by the pigs.  Fucking drop the collective 
punishment, and the "if you're not with us you're against us" bullshit; 
if someone is endangering public safety, deal with that individual, and 
that individual ONLY; and leave the rest of us the fuck alone.  And 
don't shut down a PUBLIC right-of-way because a few of the 
high-and-mighty might find it distasteful to find that average people 
might disagree with them.

Until today, until he allowed, and possibly ordered, his uniformed 
thugs to do these things; I was ALMOST ready to start liking Gavin 
Newsom.  Until today, I was slowly but steadily getting ready to 
believe that he was not the right-wing ogre he appeared to be during 
the campaign; as, until today, he was not really behaving like one.  
Sure, the gay marriage thing was nothing more than a political stunt 
designed to win himself popularity.  He could safely pull it off, 
knowing that the forces of hate and intolerance in this state and this 
country would never allow it to stand.  But hey... anything that gets 
the neo-cons frothing at the mouth like that is A-OK in my book.

Now, I see that he really is nothing more than Willie Brown v2.0, where 
anything goes, any commons can be given away, any peoples rights 
trampled upon, so long as he gets the right payoff.  Pay for play at 
its best.... for four more years.

I'm, right now, looking at pictures of the filth manhandling people, 
roughing them up, ganging up on people, intimidating people, and more.  
The commentary on places like indymedia may be written by a bunch of 
bloody useless loonies, but photos just don't lie.  Bad science, 
specious claims about imaginary dangers, and ignorant technophobic 
superstition piss me off.  Government thugs abusing the power with 
which they were entrusted pisses me off even more.  As bad a taste as 
it would leave in my mouth, I find myself, more and more, feeling that 
I must throw my lot in with those very same indymedia types.  I'd much 
rather lose the latest and greatest biotech niftiness than lose my 
right, however malformed my opinion might be, to speak my mind, or 
simply to walk down the sidewalk and meet a friend for lunch (Which I 
had to flake on because of the SFPD swine.).

To hell with biotech.  To hell with the mayor.  And to hell with the 
police.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Biotech Bullsh*t

I see it like this - the protestors are an annoyance and a financial
liability. If I was having an event that was going to be targeted by a bunch
of protesters you can damn well bet I would call on the city to do
somemthing about it. Last thing I would want would be for my attendees to
get harassed at the conference. The other problem is you just don't know
what protesters are going to pull these days. Because of that police forces
are acting like assholes because they expect the worst. Think about last
year when idiots decided it was a good idea to storm the bay bridge. That's
a huge problem and a bigger safety concern. The actions of such protesters
are still fresh in the minds of local authority.

What you're seeing is a zero tollerance policy. It's like the parents that
are finally getting tough on their wild kids. SF is cracking down on its
wild protestors. The way I see it the protestors are in the way. They're
costing someone money. They're a liability. Liability has to be eliminated.

to hell with biotech?

then you're fucking all of the patients who are receiving all
of the oncological drugs we're making.  fucking all of the
people who are alive today because of recombinant technology.

it's more like, to hell with the violent and radical protesters
who have ruined peaceful protests for everyone.

Expressing your opinion is fine- blocking traffic is not.
These protesters were allowed until they started blocking traffic.
Therein the line gets crossed from "protesting" to "actively interfering".
It really is just simple :)

Even if one accepts that line of reasoning though, it doesn't justify 
their harassment, and lumping in with the protesters, of otherwise 
uninvolved third parties.  And it doesn't justify the theft of public 
spaces from the public.

Moreover, I don't really accept said reasoning, in the first place.  No 
one has the RIGHT to make a profit.  You may have the right to TRY, but 
government should not be in the business of guaranteeing success.  And 
if the fact that people don't like your line of business creates a 
"financial liability", then too damn bad.  Be profitable enough to 
disregard said liability, deal with their concerns, or find another 
business model.  People DO, however, have the right to free speech and 
peaceful assembly.

Yes, if violence DOES break out, arrest the perpetrators of said 
violence.  But leave everyone who is not fighting, or destroying shit, 
or whatever, alone!

Right. That's why the protesters become a financial liability when they get
wound up and decide to block traffic and do their *peaceful protests*  That
terminology always busts me up. You're disturbing what would normally be a
peaceful business day and thus are no longer peaceful. =)

That and the PROTESTORS have been saying they want to "shut down the city".
I think your anger is wholly mis-directed Mr.B

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Biotech Bullsh*t

Wait - so by having the local PD out front with some barricades you're
guaranteed success? Wicked! I need to get me some of those for my house.
Your logic got a tad tangental.

Anyway - spilling into public streets and blocking off the streets that I
use gets in my way. So now you're pissy little protest that I could give a
rats ass about has been imposed upon myself on the public streets I help pay
for. That's not peaceful. Especially once my windows get rolled down and I
start screaming at you... =)

They were allowed to assemble. Then they got dumb and decided to play their
damn-the-man card and got carted off. Actions have consequences. Break the
law and you get hauled off. It's simple like that. But really this is about
you and hating police and authoritative figures. This is about you saying
fuck government even though you plainly see protestors being dumb. Did you
really care about the protest or did you care more that you saw a bunch of
cops and baricades that pissed you off for no other reason than *they can't
do that - it's a public place - fuck the police - fuck the local
government - fuck the mayor* Eat something. Your blood sugar is low!

That's why I get pissed off at the sun being in my face when I drive home
sometimes. Stupid motherfucking sun getting in my damn face making me not
see! GRRR.

Hardly.

Though I ran across various groups of protester-ish looking people, and 
I could see the main body, not a one of them gave me the slightest bit 
of crap, even though I was all "Old Navy"d up (which protester types 
generally don't like).  It was some rented knuckledragger from the 
Moscone who first accosted me, and it was the POLICE who did the bulk 
of the hassling, and it was the POLICE I saw hassling other people.

Erm....  Since I guess I didn't make it clear in the first paragraph of  
my first post, no I DON'T really care about the protesters or their  
cause.  In fact, I think it's kind of stupid.  Though I respect their  
right to have a stupid (IMHO) opinion.

What I *DO* care about is government thugs abusing their power and  
abusing people; and the public being denied access to public areas, so  
that someone who pays off the mayor doesn't have to face reality.

What does the way anyone looks have to do with the price of tea in china???

The point is this - the protestors have been on TV for DAYS talking about
how THEY wanted to "shut down the city", hence the COPS coming out in full
force.

Now, I'm not saying police being abusive is right by ANY means, but when you
are outnumbered by 10 to 1 or whatever, you tend to be a little more on the
aggro tip. Something like that could go HORRIBLY wrong in mere moments.

Personally, I don't like cops, but I understand a lot of the reasons they
act the way they do, and you really ought to take that into consideration
before you spout off about how the city and local government are trying to
fuck you over. If you're pissed about the city being shut down - look to
those who wanted it that way. If it weren't for them - that area wouldn't be
blockaded. It really is that simple.

Heh.... I'll join ya there.  The sun sucks.

One of my goals for when I rule the world is to destroy the sun....  Or  
at least to build giant sunshades in the Berkeley hills and on Twin  
Peaks to alleviate it's menace a bit.... like in the one episode of the  
Simpsons.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Hard drive failure help...

--0-819071724-1086747474=:80604
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Sorry to add to the pile of NRR crap on here...  but I got a big time problem and I'm guessing that this is the list to ask this question on...
 
During a server reboot this afternoon I had a seagate cheetah (10,000 rpm, 80 pin) drive DIE on me... while the server was on!  Needless to say I'm fucked.  If I take all the other drives off the bus the host adapter will ID it... but if i put everything back in the box and turn it on... it shuts itself off about halfway through the win2k bootup with a nice loud click that you can hear all the way across the house.  So its pretty much toast.  Normally I wouldn't care except this is the fastest drive I own and consequently...  all of my music stuff was on there as was a good bit of my "day job" crap.  
 
So I'm wondering what experience you guys have had with those data recovery type places and which ones you would recommend.  If I have to come up with a couple grand to get my data off this thing then I'll sell a kidney or something...  I just need to get it back asap...  so can anybody recommend a particular company or share your experiences with me?
 
Keep it wet & hard...

Uh- so what exactly happens if you stick it on the bus just by itself?

Can you boot off a floppy/cd and access it?

Now I wasn't there today so I cannot comment on the action of the police. I can however comment as a person who is employed in biotech. One of the reasons that there was such a huge police force and security measures at this conference is because biotechs have been getting bombed lately. Certain radical groups no longer are concerned with the safety of people working in biotech, they are only concerned with their personal agenda. I am personally happy that there were safety precautions taken to avoid violence around this event even if it did inconvenience the city.

it's more like, to hell with the violent and radical protesters
who have ruined peaceful protests for everyone.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Political electronica?

Lawgiverz (breaks DJ/producers) opened up a mix CD
last year with a George Bush speech "remixed" by
somebody from Warp Records. The mix CD isn't available
in the States, but if you ask around I'm sure somebody
was quick enough on the uptake to download the Bush
MP3 from the Warp site before they pulled it down.
They just chopped up the vocal so it has Bush saying
things like "Trusting in the sanity and restraint of
the United States is not an option" etc.

I even heard that there's a record out there which
features that modified speech pressed to vinyl, along
with another funny vocal thing and a couple excellent
breaks trax, one of them a nice bootleg. It's just a
rumor though. Probably not true.

absolutely.

places like chiron are getting bombed, their CEO's house
vandalized.  the reasons why are a different story, the methods
the protesters used is why the security is so tight.

bombing is not cool.  peaceful protests are okay.

Wish there were more politically-conscious tracks out there.  Electronica 
is pretty apolitical.  Adam Freeland's "We Want Your Soul" is culturally on 
the mark, IMO.

If you're looking social and political consciousness in music, then the 
local hip hop community is for you. Check

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Hard drive failure help...

only luck i've had with problems like that is by physically taking the exact same drive model and swapping the controller board, and
hoping that the controller's hard error map is minimal and hopefully lands on rarely used blocks.

steps you can try if you don't have another drive controller to swap with:

-remove all other drives off the scsi bus that it's on
-hard set the negotiation on the bus to a non-"Fast" rate
-ensure the LVD terminator is at the last connector of the cable to the backplane (replace if not.)
-place drive in a different slot of the backplane (tolerances in the cheaper chassis are not that great to begin with.)
-swap cable to the backplane with known good cable
-if the drive has a difficult time spinning up, while holding the drive from the top, manually give the entire drive (with cables
attached) a spin with your wrist in the direction of rotation just as it tries to start, then abruptly spinning the other direction,
then backing off slowly at the end of the backspin (hard to explain, but you get the idea.)
-if using a shitty SCSI3-to-SCA adapter, go shoot yourself in the head and be thankful it lasted as long as it did :P
-pay your web hosting bill ;)

good luck man !

ps- if anybody out there has a 36GB IBM DRHS with SCSI3 interface, i would *KILL* if i could borrow it in order to slurp 30GB of
less-traded MP3s and OGGs from 2002-2003 off a drive those controller board pysically got shorted against an adjacent drive case
(dooh !)

Needless to say I'm fucked.  If I take all the other drives off the bus the host adapter will ID it... but if i put everything back
in the box and turn it on... it shuts itself off about halfway through the win2k bootup with a nice loud click that you can hear all
the way across the house.  So its pretty much toast.  Normally I wouldn't care except this is the fastest drive I own and

fyi, baseline recovery for a drive of that nature, and size of 36GB is between $900 and $1800.
requires a deposit of the $900 and a credit card on file for any additional.  they can deliver to
you on another HD you provide or one purchased from them.  they do good work, however pricey it may
be.

Orbital - You Lots off the new Blue Album. Talks about how we've unraveled
DNA and how we're creating a new world while the one we live in has been
screwed up by us already. It goes on to say that we're taking on the power
of gods but not accepting the responsibility of one. Really good track.

Is it just me, or do these exact same dj's spin almost every week? I can't 
imagine even with them working at record stores they get that much different 
music to spin every week.

Kind of seems redundant to me.

Subject: re: [sfraves] Skills 1999 sat. /1998 fri.

The story goes like this...

"1999" party is planned where the F-8 and Skills folks play music only
from the "1999 era" (i.e., 1998 thru 2000).

"1999" sells out.

"1998" party is planned with the same DJs in the same spot the day before.
 Same "1999 era" theme, only now maybe it'll be music from 1997 thru 1999,
LOL.

There was enough music released over those years for the DJs to play
different material each night.  Doesn't mean, though, that the sycophants
who attend BOTH parties won't hear some percentage of redundant tuneage. 
Of course, anyone who goes to both events probably doesn't care if they
hear "Imagine" or "Synaethesia" 14 times over the course of the weekend. 
Poor souls.  LOL.  ;-)

YEA - but I was commenting more on the fact that these EXACT same dj's spin 
at parties (almost the identical lineup) week after week after week. Even if 
they were the coolest dj's on earth, I'd get sick of them after about 3 
months or so. I just don't get it....

Then again, these people are spinning for the "candy massive" and with that 
crowd, there's no accounting for taste. lol

Saturday and Sunday, June 12th and 13th, Chopped
Chainsaws and Non-Normally Aspirated Angle Grinders
will go head-to-head down 75 feet of two-lane blacktop
at The Shipyard International Speedway (aka Ace
Junkyard). From Super Stock off-the-shelf machines, to
full-tilt multi-motor Top Fuel moooooonnnstrosities,
it will be capacitor blowing, carbide tooth shrapnel
mayhem brought to you by, well, *you*- the finest
redneck fabricators (a.k.a. machine "artists") in the
Bay Area. Participants and spectators alike will
thrill to the speed and smells as Black and Decker,
Porter Cable, De Walt and Milwaukee battle it out for
supremacy, dubious claims to glory, lots of cold hard
cash, and yet another turn-the-key-and-drive-it-away
EDSEL for the fastest run of the day (also known
heretofore as "The Edsel Cup").

Subject: re: [sfraves] Skills 1999 sat. /1998 fri.

A-ha, OK, you were talking about the GENERAL redundancy of the DJ lineup,
rather than the SPECIFIC redundancy of these two events.  Got it.

No argument there.  But yeah, some people do seem to enjoy seeing the same
DJs play every week.  It's their money, so I figure as long as they keep
spending it as they do, things won't change.

Subject: [sfraves] mission 2 mars

okay I drove 6hrs to go to mission to mars in reno! it was kick ass... Mars 
so fucken ruled... everyone was on the same wave link... i loved it.. no 
drama..

1 one thing i hated was the fact it was all ages.. thanks to some kids it 
was closed off at 4am cause some kids where writing on the walls of the 
venue and they were setting off firer crakers off in there hotel room...
plus the fact that it was hot there was no air coming in and they weren't 
letting any people out..

heat kills!!


hugs

You could also go back into the Orbital catalog... "Choice" has the
repeated chance "peace or annihilation, it's your choice" with some
additional spicy rhetoric.

Yeah, but they're mostly just one-offs. Here are a couple that came out
last year:

3 Brotherstrong - Awake (Stupendous)
Samples Alex Jones' bit from Waking Life.

DJ Garth & Markie Mark - The Price (Grayhound)
Revolutionary rhetoric by Nkosazana Divine.

Not that I know of...

Coldcut had some subtle politicism in a few of their tracks like "Atomic
Moog 2000" and "Timber," and more overt politics in tunes like "Every Home
a Prison," on which Jello Biafra did some spoken-word stuff.

Personally, I blame the media!

Everytime there is any talk of a protest, there is always at least 5 news
helicopters hovering above the city.  I mean, if I am a protester, the 
helicopter cameras are almost *daring* me to put on a show for them...

When was the last time you saw MARS -vs- MYSTRE??  And Denise always kicks 
much ass!!

It has been a while.. afaik.  However the line-up, however redundant is the 
skills line-up.. and it is always fun.. for those who haven't been out in a 
while.. probably even reliably fun!!

Speaking of Reliable FUN.. when is the next MASSIVE??

See how I am edging the thing away from UG's.. LOL.. neat trick huh!

Anyways.. I am begining the DVD ripping project to put all MP3 on DVD.. I 
can get my whole collection on 20 disks.. anyone want to do some bulk 
trades?

A-ha, OK, you were talking about the GENERAL redundancy of the DJ lineup,
rather than the SPECIFIC redundancy of these two events.  Got it.

No argument there.  But yeah, some people do seem to enjoy seeing the same
DJs play every week.  It's their money, so I figure as long as they keep
spending it as they do, things won't change.

Why hasn't anyone mentioned CONSOLIDATED yet? They were all sorts of
political "back in the day".

I blame the media too, but for a different reason.
Genetically modified food is a serious political issue
in Europe and England, in some places it's second only
in terms of popular concern to the invasion of Iraq.
Over here it's like thirty-forth on the list, after
what flavor of low-carb milkshake some chick from
American Idol prefers.

(Damn that political electronica thread...! Whoever
you are, you got me going now...)

Anyway...I also blame the protestors...for being LAME
boring wankers...in the EU they have protestors with
actual balls, and brains to boot...they've been
destroying entire fields full of genetically modified
crops...they got caught in England and after massive
protests in favor of the protestors who were caught,
the judge let them off, saying destroying GM crops was
in the public interest. I shit you not...

Anyway, GMO is bad, and protesting without knowing
what the fuck you're talking about is also bad.

If you want to make scientists look bad in the media,
acting stupid is not the way to do it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Biotech Bullsh*t

No one "dares" protestors to act like idiots.

Speaking of the news though - I saw a snippet last night where one of the
Biotech attendees got street interviewed. He said something to the effect
of - it's so funny how misguided these people are. Most have no idea what
the Biotech industry is really about. I can't tell you how many protestors
I've seen wearing something as simple as prescription glasses that were
almost certainly improved by the Biotech industry somewhere along the line.

Not an exact quote mind you - but you get the jist. I'm not saying big
industry doesn't do a lot of shady shit - but trying to make safer food to
eat, and easier/more effective ways to improve peoples health is HARDLY
evil.

If people want everything so natural - why do they wear clothes made from
factories, or use anything that isn't 100% natural? Hypocrisy at it's very
finest.

Reminds me of the vegan punk rockers that used to harass me at shows back in
the day about eating meat - all the while sporting leather shoes. MORONS.

Mars vs. MysterE play almost every single weekend - or at least, you see
advertisements for them playing almost every single weekend. With guess who
else on the lineup: Dyloot, Tom Slik, Denise, Etc.

Same frickin' lineup - all the time. Even if I liked trance (which I pretty
much do not), that would get old REALLY fast.

I was gonna, but they often kinda stayed on the
industrial side of things.

Also, Zak de la Rocha did a pretty good track with
Roni Size/Reprazent, and like Apollo said Adam
Freeland "We Want Your Soul" definitely deserves a
mention. Huge breaks anthem, samples the great Bill
Hicks, went top forty in England, altho it is kinda
odd that an anti-consumerist message powers the most
commercially successful breaks track since the
Chemical Brothers blew up.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Markiss Anthony returns to bring the deep grooves to An Epiphany
 Of Sound Thur. morning

It's time again for a dose of the full on dirty, sweaty sheets style
house grooves.  We'll be taking care of things by providing them to you
tomorrow morning on An Epiphany Of Sound!!  Markiss Anthony is making a
much welcome return.
After laying a bit low for a while, working on his first release, he's
back and taking no prisoners.  So just make sure you're prepared to
sweat.

Be sure to listen in, 90.1 FM and online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Mars vs. MysterE play almost every single weekend - or at least, you see
advertisements for them playing almost every single weekend. With guess =
who
else on the lineup: Dyloot, Tom Slik, Denise, Etc.

Same frickin' lineup - all the time. Even if I liked trance (which I =
pretty
much do not), that would get old REALLY fast.

Hmmm- how about you explain precisely how genetically modified 
*anything* is "bad"?

Nature genetically modifies things.

"Natural" salt water is ok.
But me adding salt to fresh water to make saltwater is somehow bad?

Does not compute...

Well, I'd have to say, "nature" is, at this point, a loooong way ahead
of us as far as genetics goes.  Genetically modifying something with a
totally clear picture of what's going to happen, and no nasty side
effects- now that'll be cool.  I don't think we're quite there yet.

Plus, it seems like Monsanto et al is more interested in big $$$ and
attempting to quash the truth about these f'ed up crops than in the
impact they seem to be having.  Some of these experiments bear good
fruit, pardon the pun, but there have been some famous failures that
were happily sold to the public- and some of them have helped to edge
their natural variants out of existance, or close to it.

Organic stuff tastes a hell of a lot better anyhow :)

Someday I hope they crack the Cannibis genome..  Imagine what we could
do then... ;)

I just wanna say thanx to everybody that sent me suggestions for my lil problem.
 
I got a good number of suggestions of putting the thing in the freezer overnight...  so i did...  at first it didnt boot but one of the emails suggested turning it over etc... so eventually i would up putting it upside down cocked at a 45 degree angle and sure enough it fired up and sped along like a bat out of hell.  Only took a couple of minutes to copy the entire 36 gigs.  So whatever the problem was the freezer thing fixed it!
 
So umm thanx guys... you saved me a grip of cash (and probably an organ or two =).

Actually, I'm rather hoping that I DON'T hear Imagine.  (I have tix to  
1999... got them before I knew there WAS going to be a 1998.)

Seeing as I'm fairly sure that these are both for-profit parties, and  
not benefits, it would be entirely inappropriate, IMO, for them to play  
Imagine.  And such pretense on their part would leave quite the sour  
taste in my mouth.

But we'll see.

I also associate "Imagine" with benefits such as Unity parties (forever  
among my top 10 parties); however, the fact is, it was a very popular song  around 
1999 and was played at many parties during that time. It was almost a  cliche 
that if Mars closed a Home Base massive, he would play Imagine and they  
would turn the lights on. He'd dance around in the audience. It was a great way  
to close a party, with everybody seeing each other in the light for the first  
time, and enjoying one final song as a community before heading back to the  
outside world.
 
So, really, it would be incredibly appropriate to play "Imagine." The real  
enemy isn't people who want to play the song, it's people who would have it  
banned. I'm talking about how Clear Channel Communications sent out a list of  
songs its stations couldn't play after Sept. 11 2001, and "Imagine" was one of  
the songs (the John Lennon original).. 
 
I'm going to 1999 and am looking forward to seeing a lot of old  friends.

Well, it turns out that Markiss' kid has pink eye, and so he's dealing
with that.  So instead, we're bringing you King James this morning.
Still guaranteed to make you sweat if you've got any soul!!

Your argument would have been better if you talked about cancer as a form of
genetic modification//mutation. Or the natural genetic modifcation that
species go under over time. You putting salt in fresh water to make salt
water is not genetically modifying things...

Right- my point was that nature's *main job* is genetic modification-

And that saying something is good when nature does it but bad when man 
does it is at the very least a ridiculous generalization  :)

Blind faith in technology has lead us up the creek before, and I think 
that rather than being against all biotech (which would be ridiculous), 
the protests are more to do with how biotech crops, products, 
medicines, etc. are pushed on the public with increasingly less 
oversight and testing. Faith in our technology combined with inadequate 
testing has given us such Great Things as Thialomide, MTBE, leaded 
gasoline, and DDT, just to name a few.

sure, some of the protesters have their heads up their asses, but i 
think there's a good argument to be made for more testing and 
oversight.  sadly nowadays, a big stink (blocking traffic, for one) has 
to be made before anyone notices - unless, of course, you have a 
multi-million $ advertising and PR budget.

the bottom line is that we can't trust corporations to police 
themselves, and there needs to be more accountability and testing 
before the products of this powerful technology should be released. the 
biotech convention is a perfect place to bring these issues to light.  
It sucks that it's inconvenient for people living/working downtown, but 
it's our responsibility as citizens of this country to protest and 
speak up when necessary.

Too bad not one protestor I saw or heard said ANYTHING about the lack of

True enough- there have certainly been some testing-oversights- but I'm 
afraid that as development speeds up, things will just get bogged down.
There's an entire industry today wrapped around getting new drugs to 
people because the FDA's procedures take so ridiculously long.

The site also has the first few tracks I've been working on with George, =
including our Sound Navigators remix that is coming out on Olive Records =
this month.

=20

There's also sign up for my email list that is about to get up and =
running so please punch in your email if you get a chance.

=20

If you have any comments, questions, problems, or find any broken links, =
please give a yell and let me know, any help is much appreciated.  Big =

hosting on!

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
"that's great, ig, the title of your book."
"glad you like it, supa. what is the title of your book?"
"i don't know yet. i was hoping that it would be universally understood, but then, i realized that while it is possible to be universally understood, it would be impossible to stop the influx of social disease to follow. social disease is, afterall, also a means of self-expression, and also, a basic human right."
"your too complicated for me, supa."
"not really, ig."
"i know. i am just saying so."
"of course." :)

I just found some big goofs in the navigation...

http://www.djandrewphelan.com/flyers/042002.php

So you're in the 2002 bookings and looking at a flyer. The link back says
back to 2004 bookings when it should be 2002, or the respective year that
you're on.

Whoops. =X

Well the name of the party was Herbonium, so I'm allowed to make a stoner
mistake.  Thanks, it's updated, and it looks like it was just an isolated
mistake for that flyer's page.

Well, I'll tie this one in with the political electronica thread and

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Skills 1999 sat. /1998 fri.

the 'vs' thing is a matter of technicalities i do believe.  to start, mars
actually doesn't play the bay too often anymore.  when he does, its
primarily at the f8 or skills parties and he and mystre have different
timeslots.  i don't think they've done a 'vs' - meaning both of them
spinning the same timeslot on the same decks since the "mystre is returning
from europe" (or wherever he went a few years back) party.

I've noticed this as well for years.   I figure there's
always a fresh spring crop of candy ravers to please.
One of those, crowd stays the same but the djs get older
things.

And seriously, Mars vs Mystre happens just about every weekend.

For those who want information on Genetic Modification by humans of Food,
here are a few resources that point out the scientific claims and those of
the protesters:

Definitions of GMO:

Genetic Modified Organisms according to the Gentechnikgesetz (GenTG)from
20.06.90 (Genetic Technique Law) in Germany are organisms whose genetical
material were modified in a way which is not found in nature under natural
conditions of crossbreed or natural recombination. The genetic Modified
Organism must be a biological unit which is able to multiply itself or to
transmit genetic material.
Examples of modifications covered by this law are DNS recombination
techniques in which vector systems are used; techniques by which genetic
material prepared outside of the cell is introduced directly in the
organism. These techniques include microinjection, macroinjection and
micro encapsulation, cell fusion as well as hybridization procedures by
which living cells are formed with a new combination of genetic material
using methods which are not found under natural conditions.

A US definition of GMO "The term "Genetically Modified Organisms" refers
to plants and animals containing genes transferred from other species to
produce certain characteristics, such as resistance to certain pests and
herbicides." In the European community Genetic Modified Organism and its
release to the environment are covered by following rules:
1.- Rule 90/220/EWG from 23.04.1990 concerning the release of Genetic
Modified Organism in the environment.
2.- Rule 90/219/EWG from 23.04.1990, modified by the Rule 94/51/EWG
concerning the use of GMO in closed systems. 3.- Novel Food Decree
concerning foods and ingredients which have not yet been used for human
nutrition in a worth mentioning extent before.This includes foods covered
by the Rule 90/220/EWG; foods initial prepared by means of Genetic
Modified Organism but not containing the initial GMO any more such as
sugar obtained from genetic modified sugar beet, foods with modified
primer molecular structure, foods which had been prepared with or from
microorganism, mushrooms or seaweed, foods which had been prepared with
unusual techniques which modify significantly the structure of the food.
The content of the German GenTG is similar to the content of the European
Rule 90/220 EWG and Rule 90/219/EWG.
The genetic modification of food has the prime score to produce food with:

longer shelf life,
better properties,
using less insecticides in agriculture.

          o Better natural waste management
          o More efficient processing
    * Society
          o Increased food security for growing populations

Controversies

    * Safety
          o Potential human health impact: allergens, transfer of
antibiotic resistance markers, unknown effects Potential environmental
impact: unintended transfer of transgenes through cross-pollination,
unknown effects on other organisms (e.g., soil microbes), and loss of
flora and fauna biodiversity
    * Access and Intellectual Property
          o Domination of world food production by a few companies
          o Increasing dependence on Industralized nations by developing
countries
          o Biopiracy=97foreign exploitation of natural resources
    * Ethics
          o Violation of natural organisms' intrinsic values
          o Tampering with nature by mixing genes among species
          o Objections to consuming animal genes in plants and vice versa
          o Stress for animal
    * Labeling
          o Not mandatory in some countries (e.g., United States)
          o Mixing GM crops with non-GM confounds labeling attempts
    * Society
          o New advances may be skewed to interests of rich countries

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Biotech Bullsh*t

Hello all,

     I finally decided to leap into this fray.  For the record,
I work at a biotech conducting late stage cancer drug research
and heartily believe in its importance. However, I also carry a
partially cynical view of it and science in general and some of
the practices that go along with both (probably due to a minor
in Philosophy of Science and morals LOL).  
    Hey Stickman, do you work in biotech too??

    Anyway, what Michael said before about all of the protestors
owing their life to GMO-based medicine is true.  Virtually all
of the anitobiotics that are currently still useful have been
maunufactured and/or developed using GMO bacteria.  Unless
you've never had AB's while ill, just go ahead and move to the
back of the picket line.
    As for what you wrote, Philip, a little clarification is in
order from someone who works on the front lines.  
    Now I'm guessing you meant Thalidomide, and not
"Thialomide."  It turns out that, yes, it was not tested well
enough in the 40's and 50's during development to know that it
caused severe birth defects when originally marketed as a
sleeping aid.  No companies test on pregnant woman for obvious
reasons.  Now, science has moved by friggin' leaps since then,
as has the FDA's regulations and processes by which new drugs
are reviewed for approval...more on that later.  Using more
modern science, it has been determined that one of the only
treatments for Multiple Myeloma, a very severe form of cancer of
the bone marrow, with an 80% mortality rate.  Thalidomide
currently being developed by Celgene as Thalomide has proved to
be only one of two current treatments that significantly
increase survival time for these patients.

http://www.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials/results/thalidomide-comeback0500

    As for lack of testing or oversight...do you know that the
average time that it takes to develope a drug and bring it to
market, *after,* the 5 or so years to determine a good target
for a particular disease, is 12 YEARS!  That is a *hell* of a
lot of "testing."  The last 6-8 of those years are spent in
continual contact with and with oversight by the FDA.  Then you
have to wait up to 1.5 years (typically shortened now to about 1
year) for approval by the FDA after filing your New Drug
Application (NDA).  Over 90% of all NDA's are not approved.
   Now, I have beef with biotech's and especially with Big
Pharma.  I believe that drug companies should not be allowed to
market their drugs to patients, ie commercial advertisment as if
it were a beer.  The amount of money spent on that is completely
irresponsible and wasteful.  The billions spent yearly should go
to further durg development and basic research.
   Now, I also have beef with the FDA.  They loosened
restrictions on advertisements in the late '90s, resulting in
all this wasted time and money spent on ads.  Another problem
with GMO technology is that it is not *nearly* as regulated as
drug development.  I think the same review process should be
initiated for GMO food stuffs and crops as it is currently being
used to regulate the drug industry.
   That's my two cents....well, maybe more!  Take care...

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Dave, Ryan's talking about a background image behind the text page that
ended up getting scrapped but gave us ideas for the rest of the site.

Ryan, Dave is talking about the "taking a giant dump" pic, which is now lost
and gone forever.  Thanks for bringing it up again!

I find that if I really want to party I have to drive to the city (which =
really isn't that big of a drive as it seems) Also you have BART in =
Fremont too.

As for San Jose, lets just say that the San Jose crowd is a strange =
crowd. I've had some really fun times at the Agenda lounge (and mainly =
in the basement) but it's sort of a hit or miss type thing and it's =
mostly all hiphop these days.

Just go to the city.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Last (((THUMP))) at the DNA: this saturday!

Yeah their psytrance Thump parties will be moving to less frequent and
irregular parties, but as I understand it they'll be doing stuff at larger
venues when the parties happen.

The downtempo ThumpChill happens at Anu every Friday.

And next week Friday they're starting a Thump Live! monthly party at Living
Room Lounge for their Alice and other radio show residents that I'll be
playing at.  That'll move from downtempo to house to progressive/tribal
through the night.

I've always appreciated Clandenstine @ JohnnyV's on Wednesday nights..info
is at clubclandenstine.com - Good music, people and lots of fun, - one of
the better SJ events if you ask me. There's also Deep - SJDeep.net, they
do a lot of one offs, Aaron Jae has a new event in the South Bay - next
one is coming up - more info at djaaronjae.com, also, I'd recommend
Michael Liu's Secret Psychedlia party at the Savoy in Santa Clara, more
info @ illuminationrecords.com, lastly, I am fond of many events that go
on in Santa Cruz, check out http://www.13moontribe.org

Also, other event information can be found on the calendar @

all of this is correct.

i've heard the next thump may be back at space550.  this is all
hearsay, however.

because of recent personal developments, i forgot to mention
that the ambient mafia now has a residency at thumpchill at
anu:  first friday of the month.  so now you know when to show
up (or when to not show up ;).

the 'vs' thing is a matter of technicalities i do believe.  to start, mars
actually doesn't play the bay too often anymore.  when he does, its
primarily at the f8 or skills parties and he and mystre have different
timeslots.  i don't think they've done a 'vs' - meaning both of them
spinning the same timeslot on the same decks since the "mystre is returning
from europe" (or wherever he went a few years back) party.

I've noticed this as well for years.   I figure there's
always a fresh spring crop of candy ravers to please.
One of those, crowd stays the same but the djs get older
things.

And seriously, Mars vs Mystre happens just about every weekend.

SATURDAY, June 12th 2004, Club Six

True-Skool presents:

BAY AREA ALL STAR DJ CONFERENCE

True Skool presents The Bay Area All-Star DJ Conference, a gathering of 
turntablists, club djs and radio jocks who have made a huge impact on Bay 
Area hip hop culture. This event features the dream team, Triple Threat 
DJs, consisting of world renowned DJs, namely Apollo (Invisible Scratch 
Pickles), Shortkut (Beat Junkies), and Vin Roc (5th Platoon).

Representing 10-years in underground radio, the Beatsauce crew, consisting 
of J-Boogie, Wisdom, and Raw B will be exhibiting the skills which garnered 
them the SF Bay Guardian's Goldies Award in 1998.

As a member of the Coup, Pam the Funkstress is a pioneering woman in
the male dominated DJ world. Don't let the fact that she's a female fool 
you. Pam can cut, scratch, and juggle with the best of them. If you're 
lucky, you can catch her performing her patented "breast" scratch.

The icing on the cake is DJ Quest (Live Human/Space Travellers), the 
turntable artist and scratch innovator who coined the term "hamster 
scratch", a turntable technique recognized by DJs worldwide. DJ Quest's 
impressive battle statistics date back since '91.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

yet even still the bay area has its own flavors. i'd hate to just name a few 
because the unestablished have such great potential. any number of bedroom

i'd hate to single out just a few people that have slugged it out in the bay 
for their sound because they all deserve props for not moving on to more 
profitable digs in other genres.

long answer l8r. short answer: underhanded behavior on
the part of agribusiness corporations is dangerous and
has proven very harmful to ecologies and economies.

(ecologies includes real human people.)

it's not the technology, it's the corporations
controlling it. dangerous and irresponsible. more l8r.

I was looking at photo gear online when i spotted this:

   http://www.adorama.com/UK822FW.html

the dimensions would be perfect for a turntable. these are much lighter 
than Anvil cases, cheaper, and they're waterproof.

I just might order a pair.

IT'S OK TO SMOKE DOPE, ENGLAND FANS TOLD

Portuguese police officers will turn a blind eye to England supporters who
openly smoke cannabis during Euro 2004, having decided that a stoned crowd
is easier to control than a drunk one.

Lisbon police confirmed yesterday that England fans will not be arrested
for puffing on joints on the streets of the Portuguese capital, following a
recommendation from the Dutch authorities responsible for policing the
English during Euro 2000.

Four years ago England's match in Eindhoven, ironically against Portugal,
passed off peacefully as many supporters took advantage of the Netherlands'
liberal drugs laws. By contrast the game against Germany in the Belgian
town of Charleroi was marred by violence, much of it fuelled by alcohol.

Portugal has similarly relaxed legislation to the Dutch and the authorities
hope it will help them police the 50,000 supporters expected to arrive in
the country in the next few days.

Possession of small amounts of cannabis is not illegal in Portugal but,
technically, consumption is. However, having liaised with the Dutch, police
will not act except in extreme circumstances.

Isabel Canelas, a spokeswoman for the Portuguese police, said cannabis
would be a low priority during the tournament. "Everyone knows that here
everyone can smoke. The police are doing another kind of job and their
priorities are different.

"We won't be hiding behind doors waiting for someone to smoke a joint. We
have to use common sense. If people are smoking but not kicking each other,
not beating each other, and not making a problem, why on earth would an
officer go and ask 'Is that cannabis?'

"If you are quietly smoking and a police officer is 10 metres away, what's
the big risk in your behaviour? I'm not going to tap you on the shoulder
and ask 'What are you smoking?' if you are posing no menace to others. Our
priority is alcohol.

"Of course, if people cause a problem through using drugs and become a
menace to others, police will be expected to take action. It would be
totally different when a police officer realises there's someone trying to
sell."

Visitors to Lisbon do not have to try too hard to buy the drug. The city
does not have "coffee shops" in the Dutch style, but tourists are likely to
be offered cannabis by street vendors.

Organisers have not restricted the amount of alcohol on sale during the
tournament despite the Football Association's concerns. Beer costs just 66p
a glass and will be freely available around stadiums and at big screen
locations.

Eindhoven police spokesman Johann Beelan said cannabis was a positive
influence on public order at Euro 2000. "Cannabis ... was part of the
conditions which meant everyone had a good time," he said.

British police estimated around 3,000 English supporters had arrived in
Portugal by last night, but there have been no reports of disorder and no
arrests.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Jenny Zubiate Needs You!!!! june 18th

Yes, ladies and gentleman. On Thursday morning, june 17th at 7:30 AM, your 
friend JZ is having reconstructive ACL surgery on her left knee. "How is she 
gonna dance?" I wonder the same question myself.  For those of you who do 
not know Jenny...She has been dancing her cute, loud and wonderful little 
ass off in the SF party scene since 1996.  She is such a wonderful spirit, I 
am so glad to call her my best friend.  At the party she will be hung up, 
resting with her knee all openned up, and not able to dance or work.  If you 
know JZ, you know how much dancing means to her, for you who do not know 
her, she has been dancing as a way of expression and release for waaaaay 
long, even choreographing many dances in HS and college.  When she told me 
about this my heart sank....it sucks..
But we are going to help DAMN IT!!! hahahaha


Think happy, healing thoughts for her and please come and support her as she 
cannot work for a good month and a half or so.  This is a fundraising party 
to help cover medical costs.

So here it is Ladies and gentle-men
Friday, June 18th Friends and lovers of the infamous Jenny Zubiate are 
helping her out!!!!!
Your DJ'S for UNDER THE KNIFE:
Shazbot (Moksha Tribe, Teknotika @ newstylesound)
Lick the Micron (FnF)
Donna Matrix (Newsbreaks)
Danny Picard(my butt smells funny, extreme island happiness)
Calamity Jane (Moksha Tribe)

Music from 10pm to 6am
$10---2000$$ sliding scale donation -- a party to benefit my sugery costs.

Much Love to you all, I hope you are well and hope to see you soon!

Danny

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: Monsanto vs. Argentina

ok. more info on the biotech thing. a South American country just
experienced a major economic and agricultural crisis as a direct
result of doing business with an agribusiness company which was
selling GMO crops. don't quote me on this kz I never remember precise
details with 100% accuracy, **BUT** I think the company was Monsanto
and the country was Argentina. (a quick Google could probably verify.)

anyway what happened is that Monsanto basically convinced large
portions of the Argentinian population and government to switch to
Monsanto's soybeans, which are genetically engineered to resist
pesticide damage caused by one of Monsanto's pesticides. unfortunately
they are also engineered to be sterile, so that instead of the farmer
being able to plant seeds from his previous crop, he has to buy the
next generation of seeds from Monsanto every year. as you can imagine
it took Monsanto lots of money to persuade them this was a good idea.
(because it isn't.)

anyway the seeds did not perform as advertized and additionally the
seeds were spread by the wind, contaminated nearby fields, and turned
previously abundant strains of soybeans sterile. famine and recession
resulted, and Monsanto took no financial responsibility for the
massive and wholly detrimental effects on both the Argentinian economy
and the ability of the average Argentinian to find dinner, lunch,
and/or breakfast on a regular daily basis. in other words, people
died, jobs disappeared, and massive stretches of the countryside are
now dead and empty, where they once held healthy fields.

curing cancer: good.
causing famine and recession: not so good. hardly good at all.
possibly even BAD.

It takes courage to push yourself to places that you have never been
before. To test your limits. To break through barriers. And the day came
when the risk it took to remain tight inside the bud was more painful than
the risk it took to blossom. - Ana=EFs Nin

Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to
replenish it's source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It
dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of
tarnishings. - Ana=EFs Nin

Bio: MAURICIO AVILES
Born in the capitol of El Salvador in 1969, Mauricio Aviles immigrated with=
 his parents to San Francisco, California in 1973. Growing up in the Missio=
n District, he was constantly surrounded by the latin rhythms of the barrio=
=2E His father had a company that produced theatrical and musical events th=
at featured 'la cultura latina', and eventually Mauricio became involved wi=
th his father's creative enterprise, helping to produce several festivals a=
nd concerts in the Bay Area. The people and the music of this period provid=
ed the foundation for Mauricio's involvement in the City's burgeoning dance=
 scene that evolved throughout the 90's.
As a dj Mauricio's first actual gigs began at the City's bastion of undergr=
ound vibration, the EndUp. As a protege of Arron Olivares, Mauricio began f=
orming his own sounds and creating a devoted following that are still with =
him today. His next regular residencies were simultaneously Corazon, a lati=
n flavored weekly in the heart of the Mission District, and Metrojazz a ver=
y popular and original weekend event that successfully combined down tempo,=
 abstract beats and house, a hybrid that would eventually become to describ=
e the 'San Francisco Sound'.   Acknowledging the urban, afro origins of dan=
ce music, with a personal blend of his own latino roots, and a constant end=
eavor to break new ground, Mauricio's sound is hauntingly personal, emotion=
al and consistently fresh. Creating a niche within the deep house sound, hi=
s style, though ethereal, is undeniably funky and always elicits a great re=
sponse on the dance floor.  Now with an internationally successful compilat=
ion under his belt (Naked Music's Nude Dimension II), Mauricio has begun hi=
s production career with a debut single slated for release in Summer 2001. =
As an emissary for Naked Music, Mauricio has also commenced a global tour, =
ensuring that America's hottest new dance label is well represented.  Mauri=
cio has of late done production work and dj=92d under the moniker of MOVIDO=
, his project with collaborator and Loveslap label founder Charles Spencer.

Bio: DAVID HARNESS
In 1990, David began DJ'ing in his hometown of Monterey, California, at the=
 After Dark. As his popularity grew past the boundaries of Monterey, he was=
 invited to establish a residency at Tilt, and Sound Factory, in San Franci=
sco. In 1992, as David's popularity continued to grow he, along with DJ, Ru=
ben Mancias and promoter Joseph Solis opened a hip and popular club, Lift, =
at Club Dv8. David joined Bay Area legendary DJ, Pete Avila and host Foxxee=
 Brown on 'Your Mama's House', on the Bay Area's popular radio station KMEL=
 FM. Being the only "true" house mix show on any Northern California radio =
station, DJ's David Harness, Pete Avila and host Foxxee Brown have played a=
 key role in furthering House Music in the Bay Area. Also during that year,=
 David established a residency at San Francisco's legendary Club Universe. =
David Harness has quickly become one of the most well known and popular DJ'=
s in the San Francisco Bay Area club scene. David's popularity continued to=
 soar, taking him around the world; and the opportunity to play with New Yo=
rk's Legendary DJ's, Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, Little Louie Vega, T=
edd Patterson, Dave Morales, London's Ricky Morrison, Danny Teneglia, Marqu=
es Wyatt- to name a few. He has appeared in articles and interviews in Bill=
board Magazine, Paper Magazine, Surface, XLR8R, Urb, Streetsounds, Sweater,=
 HX, Next and the Bay Guardian.



Bio: LOVEWORKS
Add a large helping of deep underground house music with a side of funk, a =
heap of disco, and a hint of techno, and you have the most nutritious dance=
floor experience available in San Francisco. Initially conceived by Dianna =
Jacobs and Nori Castillo of Toontown /  Carefree fame in the summer of '96,=
 Loveworks was envisioned as a refuge from the monotony of local clubs and =
superficial music, and  has become one of the bay area's most well known ni=
ghts out, while somehow remaining one it's best kept secrets.  It exists to=
 unite people of any race, social status or sexuality together in a comfort=
able and friendly club environment with music as the focal point, and in ad=
dition to it's monthly parties at the Minna Gallery, Loveworks also teams u=
p with other like minded parties around the city and has been featured at c=
lubs and parties such as Liquid, the Top, Electric, and the Endup.  Besides=
 late night dancing, Loveworks has also been involved in events for Wired M=
agazine, Apple Computer, Sony Digital, Construct Internet Design, and a hos=
t of others. Loveworks also had the honor of winning the SF Bay Guardian=92=
s =91 BEST HOUSE CLUB =91 in 1999.


Bio: 111 MINNA GALLERY
111 Minna Gallery is a dynamic =91contemporary art salon=92 that provides a=
n arena for multi-dimensional artistic expression in a community atmosphere=
=2E The goal of the =91gallery-as salon=92 concept is to nurture and suppor=
t a communal gathering of artists and a collaboration between diverse art f=
orms. This goal is achieved through six-week rotations of visual art exhibi=
tions curated by the staff combined with a variety of music and film events=
=2E =91Minna=92 is not only the name of the street on which the gallery is =
found but also translates from Japanese as "everybody," an all-inclusive te=
rm that symbolizes the embracing environment of the space. The gallery, whi=
ch also offers two bars, is crafted in an eclectic, contemporary design wit=
h ample furniture inviting guests to leisurely relax and enjoy conversation=
 among friends. The combination of art, music, film, dance and conversation=
 found at 111 Minna Gallery creates a unique gathering place for a multi-se=
nsory experience.

The Phoenix Festival 2004
www.phoenixfest.com

July 1st to July 5th
The Phoenix Farm -- Trout Lake, Washington
www.phoenixfest.com/images/adams1.gif

Ticket info: www.phoenixfest.com/tickets.html

In the re:evolutionary spirit of festivals such as Burning Man, Tribal Gath=
ering, Woodstock 1 & Earthdance, PHOENIX FESTIVAL is an annual autonomous m=
usic and arts festival which takes place over the Fourth of July
weekend in the scenic Pacific Northwest.

Featuring simultaneous performances on multiple stages by regional, nationa=
l and internationally recognized performers, Phoenix Festival provides a sa=
fe
and fun environment for thousands of participants to freely express themsel=
ves through the creation of theme camps, participatory workshops, special e=
vents, performance art, and a stunning variety of audio,
video, visual & interactive art installations.

Be sure to check out the webpage (www.phoenixfest.com) to get the full skin=
ny on art projects, theme camps, the marketplace, volunteer
opportunities and other community based events.

This year we have chosen to experiment a bit with the musical format. We've=
 dropped the main stage, opting instead to hand the reigns over to the comm=
unity and foster a totally autonomous environment. You will see
that these folks really took the ball and ran with it.

Below you will find the lineups for all of the stages, each broken up into =
their respective themes.

Monsanto's contributions to society, our foodchain, agriculture and
biotechnology:

Millions Against Monsanto http://www.organicconsumers.org/monlink.html

Biotech, Biotechnology, Roundup Ready, Soybeans,
seed saving, genetically modified organisms - If you're talking about
PCBs, Agent Orange, Bovine Growth Hormone, water privatization, biopiracy,
untested/unlabeled genetically engineered organisms, or persecuting small
family farmers, you're talking about the Monsanto Corporation.

1) * Monsanto Hid PCB Pollution for Decades
Source:
Archived Copy: http://www.organicconsumers.org/monsanto/pcbs010702.cfm
Original Copy: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46648-2001Dec=

Monsanto Hid Decades Of Pollution
PCBs Drenched Ala. Town, But No One Was Ever Told
By Michael Grunwald
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, January 1, 2002; Page A01

ANNISTON, Ala. -- On the west side of Anniston, the poor side of Anniston,
the people grew berries in their gardens, raised hogs in their back yards,
caught bass in the murky streams where their children swam and played and
were baptized. They didn't know their dirt and yards and bass and kids --
along with the acrid air they breathed -- were all contaminated with toxic
chemicals. They didn't know they lived in one of the most polluted patches
of America.

Now they know. They also know that for nearly 40 years, while producing
the now-banned industrial coolants known as PCBs at a local factory,
Monsanto Co. routinely discharged toxic waste into a west Anniston creek
and dumped millions of pounds of PCBs into oozing open-pit landfills. And
thousands of pages of Monsanto documents -- many emblazoned with warnings
such as "CONFIDENTIAL: Read and Destroy" -- show that for decades, the
corporate-giant concealed what it did and what it knew...

2) * Monsanto Brings Small Family Dairy to Court

Percy Schmeiser is a farmer from Saskatchewan Canada whose Canola fields
were contaminated with Monsanto's genetically engineered Round-Up Ready
Canola by pollen from a nearby farm. Monsanto says it doesn't matter how
the contamination took place, and is therefore demanding Schmeiser pay
their Technology Fee (the fee farmers must pay to grow Monsanto's
genetically engineered products). According to Schmeiser, "I never had
anything to do with Monsanto, outside of buying chemicals. I never signed
a contract. If I would go to St. Louis (Monsanto Headquarters) and
contaminate their plots--destroy what they have worked on for 40 years--I
think I would be put in jail and the key thrown away."

Rodney Nelson's family farm is being forced into a similar lawsuit by
Monsanto. Support Schmeiser, Nelson and hundreds of other family farmers
who are being forced to pay Monsanto to have their fields contaminated by
genetically modifeid organisms. Sign OCA's "Millions Against Monsanto"
petition. These petitions will be physically delivered to Monsanto and
related court hearings.

3)  * Multi-Billion$$ Monsanto Sues More Small Family Farmer

Oakhurst Dairy has been owned and operated by the same Maine family since
1921, and Monsanto recently attempted to put them out of business.
Oakhurst, like many other dairy producers in the U.S., has been responding
to consumer demand to provide milk free of rBGH, a synthetic hormone
banned (for health reasons) in every industrialized country other than the
U.S. Monsanto, the number one producer of the rBGH synthetic steroid, sued
Oakhurst, claiming they should not have the right to inform their
customers that their dairy products do not contain the Monsanto chemical.
Given the intense pressure from the transnational corporation, Oakhurst
was forced to settle out of court, leaving many other dairies vulnerable
to similar attacks from Monsanto.

Monsanto's Agent Orange:
The Corporation Continues to Refuse Compensation to
Veterans and Families for Exposure to the Toxic Chemical

The negative health effects, due to exposure to Monsanto's Agent Orange,
have been well documented over the past three decades. The dioxin in Agent
Orange has been accepted internationally as one of the most toxic
chemicals on the planet, causing everything from severe birth defects, to
cancer, to neurological disorders, to death. But Monsanto has successfully
blocked any major movement towards compensating veterans and civilians who
were exposed to the company's Agent Orange.

Long before Agent Orange was used as a herbicide in the Vietnam war,
Monsanto knew of its negative health impacts on humans. Since then,
Monsanto has been unsuccessful at covering its tracks and has even been
convicted of fabricating false research documentation that claims Agent
Orange has no negative health effects, other than a possible skin rash.
Thanks to Monsanto's influence, the Center for Disease Control also
released a report claiming veterans were never exposed to harmful levels
of Agent Orange.

As a note, from 1962 to 1970, the US military sprayed 72 million liters of
herbicides, mostly Agent Orange, on over one million Vietnamese civilians
and over 100,000 U.S. troops. As a result, within ten years of the close
of the war, 9170 veterans had filed claims for disabilities caused by
Agent Orange. The VA denied compensation to 7709, saying that a facial
rash was the only disease associated with exposure.

In 2002, Vietnam requested assistance in dealing with the tens of
thousands of birth defects due to Agent Orange. In order to avoid medical
compensation expenses, Monsanto continues to claim this now banned
chemical is not toxic.

5)  * Taxpayers Forced to Fund Monsanto's Poisoning of Third World

Monsanto has also been implicated in the indiscriminate sale and use of
RoundUp Ultra in the anti-drug fumigation efforts of Plan Colombia. Of the
some $1.3 billion of taxpayers' money earmarked for Plan Colombia,
Monsanto has received upwards of $25 million for poviding RoundUp Ultra.
Banana crops damaged by Monsanto's Roundup Ultra.

RoundUp Ultra is a highly concentrated version of Monsanto's glyphosate
herbicide, with additional surfactants to increases its lethality. Local
communities and human rights organizations charge that Ultra is destroying
food crops, water sources and protected areas in the Andes, primarily
Colombia.

Paradoxically, the use of RoundUp Ultra has actually increased coca
cultivation in the Andes. As local farming communities are increasingly
impacted by RoundUp Ultra fumigations, many turn to the drug trade as a
means of economic survival. Regional NGOs have estimated that almost
200,000 hectares have been fumigated with Ultra under Plan Colombia.

6)  * Monsanto Takes Ownership of Public Water Resource

Over the past century, global water supplies have been contaminated with
the full gamut of Monsanto's chemicals, including PCBs, dioxin and
glyophosate (Roundup). So now the company, seeing a profitable market
niche, is taking control of the public water resources they polluted,
filtering it, and selling it back to the people. In short, Monsanto is
making a double profit by polluting the world's scarce freshwater
resources, privately taking ownership of that water, filtering it, and
selling it back to those who can afford to pay for it.

7)  * Monsanto's GE Seeds are Pushing US Agriculture into Bankruptcy
Source: http://www.organicconsumers.org/patent/exposed091702.cfm

Genetically engineered crops are causing an economic disaster for farmers
in the U.S. So says a new report released by Britain's Soil Association.
The report is a massive compilation of data showing GE crops have cost
American taxpayers $12 billion in farm subsidies in the past three years.
"Within a few years of the introduction of GM crops, almost the entire
$300 million annual US maize exports to the EU had disappeared, and the US
share of the soya market had decreased," the report said. In addition, the
study says that GE crops have lead to an increased use of pesticides,
while resulting in overall lower crop yields.

8)  * Monsanto's Ties to Government

A Monsanto official told the New York Times that the corporation should
not have to take responsibility for the safety of its food products.
"Monsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food," said
Phil Angell, Monsanto's director of corporate communications. "Our
interest is in selling as much of it as possible. Assuring its safety is
the FDA's job."

It would be nice to think the FDA can be trusted with these matters, but
think again. Monsanto has succeeded in insuring that government regulatory
agencies let Monsanto do as it wishes. Take a look:
=09Prior to being the Supreme Court Judge who put GW Bush in
office,Clarence Thomas was Monsanto's lawyer.

The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (Anne Veneman) was on the Board of
Directors of Monsanto's Calgene Corporation.
=09The Secretary of Defense (Donald Rumsfeld) was on the Board of
Directors of Monsanto's Searle pharmaceuticals.

The U.S. Secretary of Health, Tommy Thompson, received $50,000 in
donations from Monsanto during his winning campaign for Wisconsin's
governor.
=09The two congressmen receiving the most donations from Monsanto
during the last election were Larry Combest (Chairman of the House
Agricultural Committee) and Attorney General John Ashcroft. (Source: Dairy
Education Board)

In order for the FDA to determine if Monsanto's growth hormones were safe
or not, Monsanto was required to submit a scientific report on that topic.
Margaret Miller, one of Monsanto's researchers put the report together.
Shortly before the report submission, Miller left Monsanto and was hired
by the FDA. Her first job for the FDA was to determine whether or not to
approve the report she wrote for Monsanto. In short, Monsanto approved its
own report. Assisting Miller was another former Monsanto researcher, Susan
Sechen. Deciding whether or not rBGH-derived milk should be labeled fell
under the jurisdiction of another FDA official, Michael Taylor, who
previously worked as a lawyer for Monsanto.

10) Monsanto's Roundup Pesticide Linked to Cancer

Read study linking Monsanto's Roundup to Cancer.

Monsanto also produces the most commonly used broadleaf pesticide in
the world, glyphosate--or Roundup. In addition to its inherent toxicity as
a chemical pesticide, Roundup has now been found to aid the spread of
fusarium head blight in wheat. This disease creates a toxin in the
infected wheat, making the crop unsuitable for human or animal
consumption. Canada's wheat industry is currently being ravaged by this
disease. At the same time, the widespread use of Roundup has resulted in
the formation of "super weeds" --- unwanted plants that have developed an
immunity to these pesticides. Read study linking Monsanto's Roundup to
Cancer.

11) Cotton Farmers Going Bankrupt from Monsanto's GE Cotton

In India the financial figures for the recent cotton growing season have
finally been crunched. Although Monsanto convinced many of India's farmers
that buying the more expensive GE cotton seeds would result in higher
yields and better cotton, the reverse is actually true. Crop yields for GE
cotton were 5 TIMES LESS than traditional Indian cotton and the income
from GE cotton was 7 TIMES LESS than conventional cotton, due to
Monsanto's cotton having lower quality short fibers. As a result of the
insurmountable deluge of debt accrued from paying more for the GE seeds
and having a weak crop, more than 100 Indian farmers committed suicide in
the last year.

12) Wheat Farmers Say No to Monsanto's GE Wheat

Original Article:
The Heartland Wrestles With Biotechnology

By Justin Gillis
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, April 22, 2003; Front Page

The Washington Post and other major publications have been highlighting a
massive new movement of conventional and organic farmers who are working
together to pass state legislation that would put a moratorium on
Monsanto's new genetically engineered wheat. North Dakota farmers recently
met with Monsanto representatives to express their concerns about the new
crop. Steven Pollestad, a conventional farmer, said, "The foreign buyers
have flat out said they won't buy it. And I believe they won't." (Read
more...)

Japan has announced to the US that if GE wheat is approved here, it is
likely they will completely discontinue importing wheat from American
farmers. This makes up a total of 2.5 million tons of US grown wheat each
year---enough to put thousands of family farmers out of business.
Similarly, South Korean officials gave the US similar warnings in May
2003. In the meantime, Monsanto continues to test its new GE wheat in
fields across the US, despite staunch farmer opposition throughout North
America. (Read more...)

Meanwhile, Scientists from the University of Manitoba have released a
report indicating, "Under current conditions the release of Roundup Ready
wheat in Western Canada would be environmentally unsafe." (Read more...)
Despite the landslide of data revealing probable negative impacts on the
environment, the economy and human health, the FDA is posed to approve
Monsanto's GE wheat. Why?

hello, we are taking a break from our regularly scheduled  fictional post to honor the frusterated, crying child and to celebrate jazz.  lots of elements of the music you love are rooted in jazz....this is just a reminder to you:  the next time you hear some good drum and bass, for example, consider also how it is actually a fusion of an african tradition that was further developed in america and the current available musical technology. if you do that, everything comes in crystal clear. :)

::yawn::

So by those standards only BSPs for free parties should be allowed on this
list, ok.

LOL, also since you're a subscriber to this list - you must have recieved my
open guestlist invitations to everyone on SFRaves for my last *4* events.

I can't believe you'd even try to imply that im concerned with making a
profit.   The fact is, there are operating costs for our dedicated server,
and the printing/design costs of the promotional material to make the site
popular in the first place, and making it a valuable resource for promoters.

DJs charge to play,  Print shops charge for flyers, Radio stations charge
for ads, and record stores charge a service fee on every ticket.  Its just
reality.

It comes down to this - we're asking for $50 and promising 30,000 views per
ad, thats cheap as hell. Unless the party is lame, the promoter will get
more then $50 in ticket sales back.  Do you disagree with that statement?
I tried to set it at a price that would still reflect a profit for the
promoter and help us pay the bills.

Get off your high horse bro.

I do not, I play for the music...and it is fun...I will never charge to play 
anywhere...if people give me monmey, hey that is cool. I wont argue.  IT is 
a hobby, it is fun and it is releasing.
I understand your point, but... there have been lists in the scene in sf and 
everywhere that do not charge.  I think that if you are willing to pay, you 
must have some doubt on the return of the party.  If you have doubts, don't 
throw parties.  If you are throwing parties for money...DO NOT THROW 
PARTIES, they usually suck ass in my opinion on many levels.
Letting people know about the events should not have to cost anything...I 
have never paid to advertize for a party, and if you do...something is wrong 
with the music you are booking :P  shops charge for flyers, Radio stations 
charge

word of mouth never cost a thing, why should it now?

And Mr Ross...Andy is on his high horse, because he has earned it as an 
absolutely incredible key to the scene in SF.  You have no idea what  this 
boy has accomplished...and you prolly never will, he is one of the major 
reasons I have been partying since '96.  Thank you Andy.  Ross, I think you 
need to take a look at who is actually on a high horse bro...We are a part

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Last (((THUMP))) at the DNA: this saturday!

yes - it will be a fun way to say goodbye and thanks for 5 years of monthly
(((thump))) parties.  we still plan on throwing some one-off parties, but it
has been "challenging" to maintain a monthly gig since 1999.  we've had some
truly magical moments with all of you, and they inspired us to keep going
for all this time.  we've had some blood, some sweat, and some tears.  we
couldn't have a more amazing act to celebrate this last monthly party with -
Absolum is top of the tops in the world of trance.  get ready for a rockin'
good time...

this party will also be a time of healing for us personally, and also, we
hope, within this community as thump radio and jimmy siegel finally came to
a settlement in our 2 year long dispute.  we both made some concessions, we
signed on the dotted line and gave each other big hugs.  its over.  we'll
all be there on saturday night and hope that you'll come join in our
celebration and our healing.

looking forward to a great saturday night...sunday morning...  bar opens up
again at 6am.  :)

peace, trance, and (((thump)))!

I used to do that thing where you stick out your leg and your friend
sticks out his leg and then you like hook your feet together and jump
backwards. it's a great move if you want to make all the ladies swoon
and you happen to have travelled backwards in time to the Kid & Play
era.

dance moves on sfraves. I should check my e-mail more often...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Rev Moon Coronates Self As Messiah At US Senate

This is not a joke, it's all too real.

But it is funny, in a 'we're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT
you' sort of way.

Check this photo out, for example:

http://www.iifwp.org/programs/IIPC/reports/forging_path/images/DC_20040323_05148.jpg

It happened on March 23d when 'Washington Times,'  most Republican
newspaper in the country, publisher Reverend Moon coronated
**himself** as The Messiah with the help of some of our leading
Representatives, Democrat and Republican.

In case you missed it under all the Reagan hulla-balloo this week....

http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2004/06/290588.shtml

here's an in-depth piece on it:

http://gadflyer.com/articles/?ArticleID=131

wow, this is so cool.

Subject: [sfraves] Thump

i'd like to say that i had a fabulous time at Thump last night and was 
thorougly drenched in sweat when i left at 5:30am.

absolum assaulted me with some pounding, driving trance while the AM boys 
had my booty groovin to some of the funkiest, grooviest shit i've heard in 
awhile.  i tried to do the cabbage patch with AndyW but he was dancing a 
jig.

just when i thought i'd had enough and would spend the rest of the night on 
the sofa...someone came on in the back room and played *drum roll* BREAKS.  
and he played some of my favorite Plump DJs tracks and a remixed Rakim 
track.  i found my 2nd wind (or was it my 3rd of 4th?) and my toes were 
tapping like James Brown on crack.

to thump...i salute thee.  5 grand years of quite possibly the best monthly 
party i've been a regular attendee of.

SCIENTOLOGY LINK TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS

As Early As the Third Grade, Students in S.F.  and Elsewhere Are Subtly
Introduced to Church's Concepts Via Anti-Drug Teachings

A popular anti-drug program provided free to schools in San Francisco and
elsewhere teaches concepts straight out of the Church of Scientology,
including medical theories that some addiction experts described as
"irresponsible" and "pseudoscience."

As a result, students are being introduced to somebeliefs and methods of
Scientology without their knowledge.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Is anyone here a scientologist? If so, do you know of a resource which can
validate or refute this claim?

Thanks

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Jenny Zubiate Needs You!!!! june 18th


Yes, ladies and gentleman. On Thursday morning, june 17th at 7:30 AM, your 
friend JZ is having reconstructive ACL surgery on her left knee. "How is she 
gonna dance?" I wonder the same question myself.  For those of you who do 
not know Jenny...She has been dancing her cute, loud and wonderful little 
ass off in the SF party scene since 1996.  She is such a wonderful spirit, I 
am so glad to call her my best friend.  At the party she will be hung up, 
resting with her knee all openned up, and not able to dance or work.  If you 
know JZ, you know how much dancing means to her, for you who do not know 
her, she has been dancing as a way of expression and release for waaaaay 
long, even choreographing many dances in HS and college.  When she told me 
about this my heart sank....it sucks..
But we are going to help DAMN IT!!! hahahaha


Think happy, healing thoughts for her and please come and support her as she 
cannot work for a good month and a half or so.  This is a fundraising party 
to help cover medical costs.

So here it is Ladies and gentle-men
Friday, June 18th Friends and lovers of the infamous Jenny Zubiate are 
helping her out!!!!!
Your DJ'S for UNDER THE KNIFE:
Shazbot (Moksha Tribe, Teknotika @ newstylesound)
Lick the Micron (FnF)
Donna Matrix (Newsbreaks)
Danny Picard(my butt smells funny, extreme island happiness)
Calamity Jane (Moksha Tribe)
Malachi (Disco Bitch Project)
Music from 10pm to 6am
$10---2000$$ sliding scale donation -- a party to benefit my sugery costs.
Call 415 205 2223 for location details the day of the party.
Much Love to you all, I hope you are well and hope to see you soon!

thank you!!
Danny

dude, there hasn't been a party in the bay that's pulled 25k+ people in 
years.

there's the divine music festival in reno in july and rumor has it that 
they'll have some big names.  and there's a party in august that will have 
some big names as well (but not massive sized).

and the EDC down in socal is at the end of this month.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Mighty Breaks w/ Grandmaster Flash and 2 Bad Mice

niiice, and happy pre-un-belated b-day 2 u!

The Onion ran a piece a few yrs back about God giving a mad shout-out
to all the rappers who ever mentioned him on their liner notes.

Well, my girlz has like 5,000 pieces of vinyl dating back to like 1965
and she swore up and down that she had a copy of The Message and after
a year of searching thru her stacks I finally found it.

The reason I couldn't find it was that she dinnt have the 12 inch, but
the *actual* motehrflucking record that the 12 inch came offa.

how cool is that?

Sure enuff, first thing on their first record is a thank u 2 god.

who knew?

who knew that this crew was going 2 have the impact that it did?

don't know about u, but i'm sure as fuck glad they did.

just 2 keep myself in check this past week w/all the Iddy Ronnie
Raygun hype, which i dinnt believe, having lived thru it, The Message
was in heavy MTV stylee rotation back here @ the ranch.

Enjoi the show.

Ya.. the last one for me was Metropolis (mistress barbara/cox/dj 
dan/aphrodite/ak1200) and it was sick as hell.. man I wish they would throw 
another at that venue 3com Park 2002.

Before that was Audiotistic @ LBC Conv. Ctr 2001 (sanchez/carter/bukem/dj 
dan/mistress barbara/ed rush/qbert/on and on!!!)

before that Atlantis in 2000 (under 680 - mistress 
barbera/cox/ak1200/dieselboy)..

and the one that made me a massive lifer:  CyberFest 2000 
(Oakenfold/aphrodite/cox/BT/atkins)) !!!

Although all coolword/clockworks parties after that spiraly degraded into 
suckiness of epic proportion and most likely are the cause of anti-rave 
laws.. I want to say thank you for making them possible whatever the results 
were.

What were your favorite massives?

Moonshine needs to sponsor something like NOW!!!



Sat, July 22: CYBERFEST ( Coolworld Productions )

Subject: [sfraves] Bio-Tech and Reclaim the Streets...

I just got around to reading the discourse on the list about the 
bio-tech protests, and I can't really say that I agree with what I 
heard -- I was one of the protester's after all -- but I totally 
understand the sentiment I sensed regarding the biotech industry. For 
me, it's not a matter of Bio-Tech being bad -- but a matter of adequate 
safety measures being implemented. Bio-Tech is a new field of science 
that has potential to cause significant ecological destruction. Sure, 
it has potential to make certain diseases obsolete, and in some wacked 
out world-view could eventually solve world-hunger -- but these are 
only possibilities. It has the REAL ability to destroy entire plant 
species through Terminator Technologies, and it has the REAL ability to 
bring about drug treatments that prove dangerous to human populations 
as has been proven the case regarding GMO Insulin.

As we live in a capitalist system, it is the corporation's vested 
interest to get these products out as quickly and cheaply as possible, 
and additional testing cuts into profit margins, slows down the 
products introduction to the market, and risks further development 
costs should the product be proven unsafe. It's like in Fight Club, If 
the cost of the recall is greater than the projected costs to settle 
lawsuits they don't do one.

It was not so much biotechnology that I was protesting this first week 
of June as I was protesting the corporate power behind the 
biotechnology industry. I've always been in support of new and emerging 
science, but I also hold the sentiment that money and wealth can result 
in devastating consequences. If Hearst can start a war by publishing a 
newspaper, what makes you so sure an unchecked biotech company wont 
bring about ecological destruction of epic proportions. I'm not saying 
it will, I'm just saying it could.

On another note, most of the arrests happened at Reclaim the Streets, a 
party held not to protest bio-tech but to celebrate our human right to 
dance where we want, how we want, and when we want and without permits. 
Reclaim the Streets is in protest of such legislation as the RAVE ACT 
and it seems that we as a rave community should show our support for 
myself and the other protests at the Reclaim the Streets gathering. If 
not for our politics, then at least for our mutual belief in a right to 
dance!

What follows is my experience with Reclaim the Commons and the Reclaim 
the Streets on June 8th and a description of the Temporary Autonomous 
Zones or TAZ that came about during the mobilization. Your thoughts are 
encouraged. For more info on TAZ -- check out:

http://www.hermetic.com/bey/taz3.html#labelTAZ

                                                          ***

We created, not one, but at least five temporary autonomous zones. 
First there was the free Free State in golden gate park -- I wasn't 
able to attend but I've heard it went off quite well.

  Secondly, there was the Really Really Free Market in the heart of SF 
Capitalism -- this event embodied much of what this movement was about 
and I was thrilled to be there for it. I hope this is only the first of 
many free markets in San Francisco -- anyone want to help organize the 
second for July 4th and make it the first Sunday of the month?

  The third TAZ was the convergence center itself, how many of us felt 
like that became our second home while it was buzzing with activity? 
How fucking awesome was that? What can we do to resurrect that space? I 
know I would love to see that building become a community center of 
sorts, The Perma-Culture Center, maybe?

  The Fourth and Fifth TAZ's came about by sheer synchronistic chance. 
At Fourth between Howard and Mission, on the morning of June 8th, a 
celebratory space gave birth as we took over that block for our true 
celebration of bio-diversity. We danced, the drummers played, yarn was 
strung about the block as we showed the world the realization of our 
mantra, "Welcome to Possible." Free Food was brought to us by Food Not 
Bombs and we relished in our utopia until the police decided that the 
delegates were about to go to lunch and forcefully removed us from the 
streets. Shouting, swinging and snarling the police herded us onto the 
sidewalk as we fled back to our safe spaces including the welcome 
Center at 960 Howard.

  At Fifth and Market arose the Fifth and final temporary autonomous 
zone I encountered during Reclaim the Commons. As The Mutant Street 
Party began its journey down Market, everything felt a little bit 
uncertain. Our Parade began at the edge of UN Plaza and it wasn't long 
before the cops had flanked our group, first guiding us off of Market 
St. towards the Tenderloin and then chasing us back onto Market again 
as we neared our final destination at Fifth and Market. As the Cops 
surrounded us on all sides we all began to get a little tense waiting 
for the police to give the order that we all know so well by now, "As 
an officer of the San Francisco Traffic Department I'm ordering you 
back onto the Sidewalk. If you refuse to do so, you will be arrested," 
but the order never came. Tentatively we resumed our celebration in 
spite of the menacing officers that had surrounded us on all sides by 
now. Suddenly we heard what we thought would be our orders to disperse. 
We were ready to go on our way, perhaps to resume on a sidewalk plaza 
somewhere nearby, or perhaps to dissipate back to the welcome center...

  "Do Not Attempt To Cross The Police Line, If You Do So You WIll Be 
Struck By Police Batons. YOU ARE ALL UNDER ARREST."

  What the fuck? We wondered, dazed and albeit a little bit confused. 
What happened to the order to disperse? Weren't we supposed to get an 
opportunity to flea to the sidewalks in defeat? People who just 
happened to be crossing the street as our entourage neared Fifth and 
Market were now under arrest along with several passers-by that just 
happened to join into a street festival they encountered. This is San 
Francisco after all, parades, block parties, and protests are basically 
safe and common-place events. All of us, were now under arrest.

  Realizing our fate, a true celebration of life erupted as the music 
rose up once again. We danced. We chanted, we started a limbo and we 
celebrated our freedom and rejoiced in our solidarity. People with 
extra cigarettes shared with those that had run out, what little food 
and water some of us had brought was passed around freely. Once again, 
inside a police line we realized possible, and some people smoked pot 
in front of the police, safely under arrest.

  Of course, the celebration did not last long and the police quickly 
seized our sound system. They made us wait for several hours while the 
police seemed to do nothing but eat snack food and drink bottled water 
while we grew tired and thirsty. It was approximately 6:15 in the 
evening when we were told that we were under arrest, by 11:30PM I was 
still waiting to be taken into the paddy-wagon and I wasn't the last. 
For over 5 hours, we were denied both water, as well as a means to 
comfortably and legally relieve ourselves.

  And still, despite all these efforts on the part of local law 
enforcement, everyone was in quite good spirits in the holding facility 
outside 850 Bryant as those of us who were unable to participate in 
jail solidarity waited to be processed. As they called out for the John 
Does, we raised our fists and sang "Solidarity Forever" not knowing 
when we'd see our friends again.

  Getting out of jail, there were people all around us -- helping us 
with food, and water and love -- it was a great feeling having you all 
outside the jail with your support. And I'm glad I was able to be there 
when all our John and Jane Does were finally released.

  Reclaim the Commons was not June 3rd through 9th, Reclaim the Commons 
was our declaration in action. "Reclaim the Commons. Take it back! 
Seeds will grow when the empires crack!"

Subject: [sfraves] visiting san fran - any weeklies to check out?

hi all,

i'm going to be in san francisco this week and was wondering if there are 
any weeklies to check out.  i'm particularly interested in dnb nights, but 
just about anything will do.  i've been stuck in AZ without a lot going on 
lately.  i'm dying to hear some music.

lemme know what's up.  :)  thanks!
~kerri

Now that I think about it and did a little research.. which was mostly 
useless because they changed the lineup about 10 times.. I did however 
request from clockworks the final lineup.. I will post if they reply.

The main field (MetroDome) lineup went something like.. glaude / mistress / 
dj dan to close.

No carl cox!  Thanks for the sanity check.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Any massives 4 summer?

Hey, it would have been a much better party if Carl played there. From about 
5PM on everyone in the Metrodome not named Misstress Barbara played pretty 
much the same stuff. Everyone except for Barbara played Afrohead's "Crybaby" 
too. Must have heard it 9 times.

Donald Glaude pulled the most impressive technical stunt I've ever heard a 
mixing deejay pull that evening too. He was in rare form.

Subject: [sfraves] Guest List Offer for SFRaves Members 


Dear SFRaves,

I would like to extend a special invitation to SFRaves members:

The promoter of this event has requested that I offer you a special Guest
List selected for SFRaves members to attend an event of creative
proportion:

June 18th (Friday) - Urbanology by Urban Couture Hosts of the evening:
Geno Giovanni, Jose C, Tommy, Blyssful Fantasyes, Clandestine, the XOX
models, and Ladies of Persuasive Productionz: Miss Teen Latina USA - Erica
Martinez, Melissa Marie, Felicia Marie, Durina Marie. Room One [hosted by
Basco - House/80's/Breaks/Dance]: RECKLESS RYAN, JACK LACORTE vs. KUE,
KORMARA, DUY PHAM vs. MURPHY, DJ BANGIN' B, JOSE CARILLO vs. RICHIE
PELAYO. Room Two [Hosted by MC Fish and Ravenous - Hip Hop/Reggae/R&B]: J
ESPINOZA, DJ MANIAKAL vs. ANTHONY A, REZZ, JEST-ONE, DEREK MIZUNO, DNOKS
vs. DRUSKO. Urbanology will feature a 3 hour fashion show on an extended
cat walk with over 10 hip west coast designers. There will also be two
rooms of music, an art show, B-Boy showcases, comedian performances, a
multimedia showcase and much more! Get ready for a night of strutting,
styling, schmoozing, shopping, and grooving. Doors open at 8pm with shows
throughout the night. Artist showcase: Dee Jae Paeste, Maria Speranza,
Tammi, and more. Multimedia Showcase: Next Trend Technologies, nVidia, and
more. B-Boy/Dance Showcase:  DSD1 Crew, Rythem Raskalz, United by Style,
and more. Comedian Performances: Nelson Rodriquez, Wise Crack Jack, and
more. Urbanology will be held on the second floor in the beautiful Crowne
Plaza Hotel @ 777 Bellow Drive, Milpitas, CA on Friday, June 18th starting
at 8:00pm. Get $18 presales @ groovetickets.com to ensure entry and so you
don't end up paying $20 at the door! Also, VIP tickets include: reserved
front row fashion show seating, free clothes, cds, after party access,
raffle tickets, and much more for $40.  --

The special prices for this guest list are a significant discount over the
standard cost:

$10 for 18+ and $5 for 21+, meaning = save 8 bucks for 18+ and 15 bucks
off the regular prices of presale and door by being added to this list.

Please send me an email with your first and last name, age (or whether you
are 18+ or 21+) and I will ensure you are added to the list. I need to
submit the list by tomorrow evening (Wednesday) in order to take advantage
of this offer for your behalf.

Please direct all guest list inquiries to: karina@hyperreal.org /
karina@sfraves.org and a reply with more instructions will be sent back to
your address.

Thanks!

Karina

Subject: [sfraves] calamity jane on ice & <quasi-bsp> under the knife

i started making chill/downtempo trax a few weeks ago
*finally*.  it's something i've wanted to do for a
loooong time so like..um..i just did it ;)   without
further adieu, here are the fruits of my labor
(comments are welcome):

http://www.acidplanet.com/artist.asp?songs=279345&T=694

see you all out at jenny zubiate's 'under the knife'
party!  donations are welcomed, encouraged and
somewhat required, and for a good time and the
location it's definitely worth it.  again, you can
call 415 205 2223 for details, but me, shazbot,
micron, donna matrix, to name a few, will be playing
:)
if i'm not mistaken, there will be some trampoline
action too but maybe danny can clarify if that'll be
available or not ;)

jenny's my roommate, and i definitely want her to make
rent this month too so... yeah.  see ya there ;)

Hey there, all

most happening happy hour in the City, 9 years runnin!

You're gonna be bangin your sound system?  You sick fuck...no giving marshal
any ideas, last thing I need to do is pick up a speaker with some sticky goo
on the handle.  I mean I love sound, I really love loud sound, but bangin
your sound system, that's just a little weird.  Try using a Ziploc and some
lube strategically placed between your mattress and box spring, feels way
better and doesn't risk damage to any speakers.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Thump

thank you brandon for coming out to play with us...sorry you had to leave so 
early!  ;)

thanks to everyone that made that a perfect way to say good bye to the 
monthly DNA parties.  the music was bumpin in all rooms, all night.  it is 
going to be weird not to host a monthly party now...it was the most regular 
thing in my life since 1999!

we are working on some one off events back at 550 barneveld - hopefully one 
in july, one is september and one in october...

thump radio is going thru some tough times as of late - so thanks to all of 
you that came out to support us.

also, btw, the last dj was fiddler - check him out:

peace and thanks for 5 years of spectular parties!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bio-Tech and Reclaim the Streets...

Josh,

	I won't argue with you about GE Insulin since I haven't studied it, 
but I do want to offer a correction on a couple side points you made 
here:

>>> As we live in a capitalist system, it is the corporation's
>>> vested
>>> interest to get these products out as quickly and cheaply as
>>> possible,
>>> and additional testing cuts into profit margins, slows down
>>> the
>>> products introduction to the market, and risks further
>>> development
>>> costs should the product be proven unsafe.

	First of all, we don't really live in a capitalist system. The United 
States has a mixed economy that is part capitalist and part socialist 
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#Economy).

	For example, Tax Freedom Day in the United States this year fell on 
April 11. That's the day when the average American had finally earned 
enough money to pay off her total tax bill for the year (see 
http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxfreedomday.html). This means that 
almost a third of the year in the U.S. is spent paying for the burden 
of government, or in other words, the U.S. is about one third socialist.

	It has also been argued convincingly that measures such as Tax Freedom 
Day do not take into account all the hidden costs of government 
regulations and barriers to entrepreneurship and economic growth, and 
that in reality the U.S. economy is about half socialist.

	Second, in your analysis of the motives of corporations above, you 
neglect to mention the fact that companies have a significant interest 
not only in avoiding expensive lawsuits over unsafe products, but in 
protecting their reputations. The cost of a lawsuit alleging harm 
caused by a product costs a company much more than just the dollar 
amount involved -- it hurts the company's products in the eyes of 
consumers, costing lost sales.

	Ultimately, companies are accountable to the public. They have to 
compete by offering products or services people want at prices they are 
voluntarily willing to pay, or they will go out of business.

	Governments, on the other hand, have no similar accountability. Even 
if people do not like what a government is doing, they cannot simply 
withhold their support, because government backs up its demands for 
payment of taxes and compliance with its laws by using armed force to 
threaten confiscation of money or property, imprisonment, and 
ultimately death.
	
Peace, love & liberty,

Staten motehrflucking Island, thanx moms 4 giving me a Huck Finn

I needed a valentine right about now, and the Beasties of Stuy, (my
kid brother was actually in the same class as them, but he snobbed
them down, guess who's been doing better since 1987), have once again

To think I walked away from a job as Transportation Coordinator for

Subject: [sfraves] A letter against Bush's reelection

	Call me hard-hearted, but I found this sob story too amusing not to 
pass along.

					<<< Starchild >>>


Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak my mind. I lost my
job this past year.

When Clinton was president, I worked in a prosperous enterprise. But
in the last year, we had to close our operations.

Far worse, I lost two of my sons in Bush's evil war in Iraq. They
gave their lives for their country, and for what?

My pain at losing my sons is indescribable.

While it is trivial next to the loss of my sons, I regret to say that
I also lost my homes. I simply have nothing left.

I am a senior citizen with various medical problems -- and I'm a
shut-in. I'm not in a position to begin a new career. I was reduced
to the point of homelessness -- all because of President Bush.

And when the authorities found me in my modest, borrowed hovel, did
they have any compassion for my misfortune and ailments? No, I was
arrested

If I had any money left, I would donate most of it to the Democratic
party. If Al Gore had been elected in 2000, I guarantee you, I would
still have a job, my homes, and most importantly, my sons.

And if we can get Kerry elected, I may be restored to a position of
dignity.

Sincerely,

Saddam Hussein

Hehehe, quite funny- but personally I'm looking well forward to having
a president that approaches foreign policy with a smidge of forethought
and a measure of SMARTS, instead of sabre-rattling and indescriminate
attacks!

Bush's outlook on the war reminds me of a kid who totals his parents'
car and tries to justify it saying, "Well, yeah, I wrecked it, but now
it'll get that new paintjob you wanted!" :)

I'm seriously considering moving to England if he gets in the White

that's why they call it beta testing. you know what else doesn't work?
the context-sensitive ads. I keep getting ads for help with math

Well, for those of us without dual citizenship, who are otherwise
"skilled" workers, you might want to check out this:
http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/work_permits.htmldefault.asp?PageId=2757

And for those folks who continually say "if you don't like it here,
move", you will finally have a definitive answer. ;)

     well i'm registered and i plan to vote for Kerry i voted Gore last time 
and i'm still pissed about that, but anyway i might be moving to Vancouver 
B.C. in January reguardless of weather Bush wins or not and it's actually not a 
politicaly driven decision, it's just because i want to go to school there and 
it's much cheaper economically than San Fran yet on top of that it's cleaner 
and more polite than anywhere i've ever been in my life. And for a place so 
clean and polite can you believe it's nickname is "new amsterdam" because they 
grow tons of weed there. John Kerry has some great points if you ever listen to 
the man talk... and somebody has to stand up to Bush right?? i mean you can't 
beat bush just by not voting for bush, you have to vote for Kerry, period. I 
don't consider myself a democrat or anything else, it's just that realistically 
someone has to BEAT bush, they have to get the MAJORITY of votes (actually 
they have to get the majority of states too) and although most ravers and other 
radical groups of people would not like someone as moderately conservative as 
Kerry be president, ya still gotta vote for him. then maybe next term around 
we can dick around with 3rd party candidates (hell i wouldn't be surprized if a 
3rd party won in the next term or the one   after that) but now is not the 
time. The negatives people say about Kerry only make me want to vote for him 
more. people say things like oh he was a War protestor he had long hair. He left 
one of his war metals from vietnam on the steps of a capital building. oooo 
what a bad guy. on the radio Rush Limbaugh plays a clip from a John Kerry speech 
where kerry says he wants to stop the bush cabinet's plan to make more 
nuclear weapons because they send a bad message out to other nations who we're tr
ying to take them away from. Rush Limbaugh says "Don't these democrats 
understand?? we have to make nuclear weapons so that we don't have to use them! Because 
we're the good guys!" yea and i suppose the rest of the world is just supposed 
to trust us right? or else boom! come on guys does that sound like 
imperialistic agenda or what? Kerry has the courage to stop a plan already in effect to 
make more nuclear weapons and he wants to work more cooperatively with forgn 
leaders. Bush has no international comunication skills, he declined a debate 
with Sadam Husien before the war had to break out. He didn't even have the 
decency to have a national debate and show the world who was right and who was 
wrong before he decided to kill people. Bush is a pussy, period. but somebody has 
to actually beat him and that person has to be Kerry. It's like all this talk 
about how bad Bush is, lets concentrate on the man that has to beat him, talk 
about something positive. the pistons didn't beat the lakers because they hate 
shaq and kobe they beat them because they were a much more wholesome, 
complete team and they believed in themselves... anyways my rant is over take a deep 
breath,   peace - jaze

I looked out the window seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
I scoped with my scopes he had no hair
Launched that shot -  he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the sling-shot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct wit' my egg-gun
The egg -  a symbol of life
Go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke
The trigger I pulled, his face the yoke
Reached in his pocket took all his cash
Left the man standing with an egg mustasche
Suckers they come a dime a dozen
'When I say dozen you know what I'm talkin

Well that seemed to work fine. Although, I had to click on the thread
to see my response. Looks like gmail automatically places new messages
into their respective threads....or something like that.

Actually, it's widely understood that many corporations knowingly break
the law because they know that it's cheaper to settle in or out of court
than to pass up the profits they gain from doing so. Then they hire
lobbyists to push "tort reform" so that caps can be placed on the
monetary value of the damage they do to society. "Reputation" means
little in this country, where a large percentage of the population can't
be bothered to read the news regularly. And the media tends not to
report issues of corporate responsibility unless it's a national scandal
(Enron, Tyco, et al). Billions of dollars are paid by corporations every
year in out-of-court settlements so that they can avoid public backlash.
These days, "reputation" is really just a matter of how well (and often)
products and services are advertised.

Gimme a break. Having the lowest prices isn't being "accountable" to the
public. Corporations are ultimately accountable *only* to their
stockholders. If the stockholders demand that a company take action to
realize a profit, the company leadership has little choice in the
matter. The market has no built-in social responsibility. It's only as
responsible as the stockholders and the law dictate that it must be.

And since most stockholders aren't in the least bit socially responsible
themselves, we have to rely on the law to keep corporations in check.
But the corporate lobby is so strong now that they're essentially
rewriting the law in their favor.

> Governments, on the other hand, have no similar accountability.

You've got the whole thing backwards. Govermnent-run businesses are the
only ones that *are* publically accountable. If you don't like the way
that a particular public service is being run, you can appeal to your
representatives to change it. Most public services were originally built
to run at a loss so that they *can* address public complaints more
easily (and without having to lay off employees or cut back services).
Corporations, on the other hand, are bound to the task of making a
profit for their shareholders, so the only (legal) way you'll influence
their decisions is by boycotting them. Boycotting a public service
wouldn't really do anyone much good (especially the people that it
aims to help).

That's why everyone needs to get more involved in government. Taxes
exist because nobody is willing to participate. It's a vicious circle,
and the only way to break out of it is to get directly involved. I'll
tell you one thing, putting public services in the hands of private
corporations isn't going to solve anything. You get what you pay for,
and American corporations excel at offering cheap goods, low-wage jobs
without benefits, and huge profits for the already-wealthy.

Tonight's the last night to catch The Corporation at the Castro Theatre.
If you're interested in the subject of corporate responsibility (or lack
thereof), I would highly recommend it:

word, what is this Ayn Rand bullshit? the only real functional
restraint on the criminal activity of corporations is the amount of
rioting people do. go see "The Corporation," now playing at The
Castro, and burn your copy of "Atlas Shrugged." I loved that book when
I was 17, in fact I practically memorized it, but I'm not 17 any more,
and I don't think you are either, Starchild. Where do you get this
ridiculous bullshit? there's only one type of organization in America
which is less trustworthy or more dangerous than the corporation, and
it's the fucking Mafia.

you Libertarians are all like ooh government this oooh government that
but in case you haven't noticed, Enron vs. California, who won?
please! big part of the reason I moved to the middle of nowhere. I got
an energy bill for $30 one month and it was $300 the next month. fuck
that, you can bill my Desert Eagle.

ps: http://www.thecorporation.tv
pps: nothing personal, I admire you for taking a stand and
representing your beliefs etc., but I think you need to bring those
beliefs down to earth once in a while. it's all well and good to be a
Starchild but politics is about what actually happens on the surface
of the planet.

more like an effort to keep mom & pop corner stores in business, and 
keep the money in the local economy.

maybe we should start petitioning them to carry slurpee machines.

actually I think that's exactly it. chain stores seem to be less

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Andrew Phelan and Origami on An Epiphany Of Sound tomorrow 9a

  Tomorrow marks a return appearance of Andrew Phelan to Epiphany of
Sound for a tag team set with partner in crime Origami.  Origami is new
to the show, and it's been entirely TOO long since Andrew's been a
guest, so now's a great time to bring you both.  Both have a release on
Olive records.
  Expect Andrew to highlight his Chicago roots in this set that's not to
be missed!
  You can also hear Andrew every Wednesday @ 11PM in Los Angeles on KBIG
104.3 and on rotating Saturdays @ 9PM in San Francisco on Alice 97.3 for
Thump radio.
  Don't miss this one.  We go from 9a-11a only, over the air in the bay
area at 90.1 FM and online worldwide at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Peace!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR mercenary ranting

Does anyone really think that every 7-11 is corporately owned?

They are owned by local, private franchisees for the most part. Just like a 
mom and pop store is except for the mandatory franchise and advertising 
percentage they have to pay to the corporation. Most 7-11 owners money does 
stay in the local economy (unless they are sending it all back to family 
members somewhere else in the world).

AUDi,
Gavin

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR mercenary RANTING

Speaking of franchise'es anyone here eat Quizno's? So damn good. MMM I'm =
hungry. Way better then subway and Togo's (yuk I used to work there).

Geeze I feel weird today. Any couples out there want to do a threesome =
or something (I've always wanted to try that)?

 I got interviewed about people getting high off of dextromethorphan =
because of my domain name. It was funny. I made it VERY clear that there =
isn't any association. But is therE? nah. Not like I could find any =
hookups for better tickets anyway and last time I got ripped off.

It's all about the music.

Sometimes I think I live in bizarroland, where up is down, left is
right, and Bush is in the Whitehouse.

i think that we should police ourselves before we go to foreign lands.
there is plenty of torture within our borders.

i don't tell my next door neighbor how to live or raise her kids, what
gives our country the right to police others?

When your nextdoor neighbor's kids start riding their bikes into your =
kid's playhouse you have to start teaching your neighbor how to raise =
their kids.

It's called self defense.

Or, if your neighbor abuses their kids, you have the right to intervene.
Someone should intervene before this analogy gets totally out of hand.

	As a matter of fact, the last time I was at The Castro was to watch 
Ayn Rand's "We The Living."  8)  Great film, banned in Italy under the 
fascist Mussollini government. Sorry you don't appreciate her any more. 
There's few authors whose ideas are more despised and feared by the 
political elite. Those who haven't read "Atlas Shrugged" ought to.

	I'm not a big fan of corporations, but it's sheer cluelessness to say 
they're more dangerous or out of control than government. The U.S. 
government is profit-oriented and expansionist just like a corporation, 
but instead of limiting their goals to making money, its political 
executives and directors want to control virtually your entire life. 
Furthermore they have the armed force of the law and a perceived social 
mandate to back up their greed for money and power.

> you Libertarians are all like ooh government this oooh government that
> but in case you haven't noticed, Enron vs. California, who won?

	Hmm, well, let me see now. Enron is out of business and a number of 
its executives are facing prosecution and prison. But the government of 
California is bigger and more powerful than ever, despite having ripped 
off many more people for a whole lot more money than Enron ever did. 
The people running California's government won't pay the bill for the 
Enron debacle, even though they were ultimately responsible. Ordinary 
ratepayers like you and me will pay.

	If government didn't restrict individuals from producing energy 
themselves and getting credit for whatever they add to the grid, your 
energy bills would be a lot lower. Blame the government-created energy 
cartel; Enron was only part of that system, not the cause of it.

	Oh, come on. I'm sure you agree with me once in a while. If you don't, 
then you must agree with the Republicans on a whole lot of issues.  8)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (NRR) Call today to stop government torture

i guess one can make up any reason why one should intervene.  the point is
there is no World Police organization.  We as a country should not act a
la vigilante.

there is no evidence to support that Iraq had anything to do w/ 9/11.  so
whom are we self-defending against?

im stunned!
the US goverment as no right to police anybody.
the problem is that the USA is so stung up on power and how "fucking perfect 
we are as country, not" that we all think we can go around telling other 
people how to run their countries and what they should belive in, not 
diffrent from the crusades.
im not surprised we are getting planes flown into our buildings and soldiers 
decapitated!
as a country america is a big fucking joke.

Yea - but Government is more or less controlled by corporations - so it's no

well im glad u are only 10% serious, ok now im curious to know what that 10% 
is !
and as far as the spelling goes, the only reason why i brought it up its 
because i use to get torn apart for miss spelling (im a mother language 
italian speaker).

so yeah ... but im curious to know about that 10% still!

its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

I think a certain level of torture may be necessary in interrogation.
I'm not a military person so I don't know what if any information can
be obtained from these people. I''m pretty sure tho information had
been obtained that has saved many American lives.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Gmail problems?

i know, isn't it great?

epic, 600 msgs + flame wars are now one, (1), count 'em one line in my in box.

what's not 2 like, or am i just chopped liver here?

the 'bug' you're seeing when u send an email to a list is that it
doesn't show up as a 'new/unread' msg, if you want 2 c it u have 2 go
2 your 'all mail' msgs folder/link 2 c it, i've already written google
about this repeatedly on the beta bug report feedback link which i'm
no longer seeing this very minute.

the other major issue i'm having is that i can't field sort by
name/date/size which is bullshit, i should be able to both search
**AND** sort, they're like Apple as far as this goes in terms of
dictating of what's 'best' for me.

the other thing that bugs me is that i can't set up
folders/directories so gerin dahl gets her own very special rioooom 2
werk her majic in, but i've figgered out a
super-special-extra-great-fine-kludgy-werk-around 4 that which
involves using their filter system which is 2 complicated 2 get into
this very second, kinda need a Ph-Motehrflucking-D 2 follow all the
steps involved, so i won't, but if anyone wants 2 know how i did it,
hit me back heah and i'll tell ya, as soon as i sober up.

:P

What i'd like 2 see on this list is that everyone that's already got a
GmaiL acct of their own set up, G, 2 share the moterhrflucking wealth
w/their fellow SFR's, (i already have), and get this whole list set-up
with an acct so we can finally flip attachments @ each other off-list
and not give brian and hyperreal a heart attack.

i don't have a problem w/google carrying our water 4 a bit.

also, a **public** gmail acct where all sorts of mp3's mpegs pdfs etc
etc acessible by anyone wouldn't be a bad idear either, but that's
just me.

Hello,
 
This country really is some sick joke and all twisted and run by
'capitolist american pigs' but what is fueling this country... the
money.  This is hillarious.  Maybe we should all get up and overtake the
government... how about we get someone to start running for mayor... and
spread from there... they we will own the country... muhahahha.... and
we can say what happens to the people that attack our soil... look what
happened last time... how many women and children were burnt to ash that
time??  muhahaha... This thing called a human is such a funny thing...
think back to before we were civilized... are we really civilized??

Poll reveals hostility to US and support for rebel cleric


By Anne Penketh Diplomatic Editor


17 June 2004

The Bush administration's last remaining justification for the invasion of 
Iraq has been demolished by a private poll revealing that only 2 per cent 
of Iraqis regard the occupying forces as liberators.

The poll results are devastating for both President George Bush and Tony 
Blair, who are fond of saying that future generations of Iraqis will thank 
them for liberating their country. Tony Blair has consistently said that 
history will prove him right for engineering the downfall of a cruel 
tyrant, even if weapons of mass destruction were not found.

President Bush, giving a pep-talk to American soldiers in Florida 
yesterday, said: "We have come not to conquer, but to liberate people and 
we will stand with them until their freedom is secure."

Yet the main findings of the poll, which was commissioned by the US-led 
Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) last month and which was leaked 
yesterday, reveal that only 2 per cent of the Iraqis polled in mid-May see 
coalition troops as liberators, while 92 per cent said they were occupiers. 
In a crumb of comfort for the coalition, only 3 per cent expressed support 
for Saddam Hussein.

A total of 54 per cent believed that all Americans behaved like the guards 
at Abu Ghraib. But 71 per cent of those polled in face-to-face interviews 
in six Iraqi cities said they were surprised by the guards' behaviour.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war,

its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

This shit makes me so tired. Actually I've been up for over 36 hours,
so it's only fair to point out that lack of sleep makes me tired too.
And insomnia, insomnia really makes me tired. But! All I really want
to say about all these issues is that if you find yourself thinking
about them and wondering about them and developing all sorts of
opinions about them, and everybody is going to have that experience in
the near future, then one great thing you could do is to get a copy of
the book "Divine Tragedy" by Paul William Roberts. It's an amazing
book by an amazing journalist, it's all about his three visits to
Iraq, twice before Desert Storm in the late 80s, and once actually
during Desert Storm. He had to sneak into the country disguised as a
Bedouin, but some Iraqi soldiers figured out that he was a Westerner.
They caught him, stripped him, tied him up bare-ass naked in a
basement, and left him there for four hours. And then they freed him.
They give him his clothes back and they even give him his Rolex back
and then they tell him how much they like him and how wonderful they
think he is. And he looks at the Bedouin smugglers who had brought him
into the country like, what the fuck is going on? And the Bedouins
tell him that when the Iraqis took all his stuff, they started
dividing it up, and then they found his first aid kit and come to the
conclusion that he was some kind of doctor. And when he had gotten
dressed again and put his Rolex back on they brought him casualty
affter civilian casualty. They brought him an 8-yr-old girl who had
her leg blown off, and he's supposed to help this girl, and he's got a
Band-Aid, a jar of iodine, and a bottle of whiskey.

It's not all sad, tho -- there are some very funny parts too. And you
learn a lot about what Iraq is really like.

Good book. I recommend it.

ps: the Army is experiencing an abnormally high suicide rate among
infantrymen in Iraq. if this issue really matters to you, get in
contact with somebody over there and send them something nice just to
let them know you give a fuck.

Amen to that. 

During the past Primary Election, I was discouraged by the fact that I 
was one of three people at my work (55 employees) that voted. I found 
that most people weren't even registered.  The number one reason for not 
registering:  the fear of increasing their chances of being called in 
for jury duty.  As a registered voter for about a decade, I did not feel 
that I had experienced a higher frequency of jury duty notices than 
anyone else. 

A couple months ago, I wanted to throw some outdoor events where people 
could register to vote.   However I feared that those who rejected the 
offer would return the same response -- jury duty.  Assuming those who 
wished to vote would already be registered, I felt that my best tactic 
was to test the validity of the theory: does registering to vote 
increase one's chances of being called in for jury duty?  This prompted 
me to ask the State Secretary elections department 
(http://ss.ca.gov/elections/elections.htm) of the connection, if any, 
that existed between voter registration and jury duty.  I was surprised 
that I even got a response (1 point - California, 0 points - AT&T 
wireless, but that is an entirely different matter).  My interpretation 
is that anything is game, DMV records are the primary source.  I've 
attached the email below for you to decipher this for yourself.

I do not endorse the adage, "you're damned if you do, you're damned if 
you don't." 

When I was young, I was embarrassed by the fact that my Mom saved 
pennies -- she would even pick them off the street. Her childhood was 
when a penny was worth a little more.  One penny might not have been 
enough for a candy bar, but 5 were (?).  I don't know how much 537 
pennies could have bought in the 50's, but that was the margin that 
decided the 2000 Presidential Election (source: CNN 
http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/27/presidential.election/).

Obviously, there are those abroad that are really pissed at our 
government.  Their rage has surpassed even the most basic foundation of 
human decency.  Whether the invasion of Iraq was justified depends on 
your point of view.  IMHO, military action should be used sparingly as a 
last resort when all other paths have been exhausted.  "The purpose of 
politics [is to], to bring people together when they cannot control each 
other and they must work together."  (Bill Clinton, Cornell University 
5/29). 

I am not an activist.  I am not one dictate what one should do or not 
do. Choose as you will.  Keep in mind that our definition of inalienable 
rights are constantly being redefined by our government from 
inauguration to inauguration alongside our international policies.  
Consider the hostages whose last memory is that of a bullet collecting 
it's toll  Or a cold knife blade dredging through the outer layers of 
your neck, severing all the muscles and tissue that once supported life, 
struggling through the resistance of your vertebrae until you scream no 
longer.  What if you could have done something to prevent all of this?

I even drove back from AZ, starting in the EARLY A.M., last fall so that
I could vote in the Nov. elections.  Now I'm registered permanent
absentee voter so I have a nice window to vote via mail.  I suggest
folks do the same.

we are a republic - in which the people give elected representatives and=20
officials the power to govern for them.). Unless you are a voting line=20
republican or democrat (or the party in majority power in a state)  and=20
are hand selected by these political parties to vote as part of the=20
electoral college, your popular vote is merely a paun in determining who=20
gets voted into the executive branch. The electoral candidates determine=20
who becomes president, not the average voter. Our forefathers thought that=
=20
the voters (us) were too stupid and illiterate to make the "proper"=20
decision of who governs us at the executive level.

Interesting articles on the electoral college:

1) Debate over the electoral college:

http://encarta.msn.com/text_761576768___11/Electoral_College.html

"...The most common criticism of the electoral college, and in particular=
=20
the winner-take-all system, is that it makes possible =93the wrong=20
winner=94=97that is, a candidate who did not win the popular election. Thes=
e=20
critics say the winner-take-all system is largely responsible for the=20
possibility that a candidate can be elected president even though he or=20
she polls fewer popular votes than the opponent. If a candidate receives a=
=20
minority of the popular vote nationally but carries a sufficient number of=
=20
states to ensure a majority of the electoral votes, the candidate is=20
elected. As a result the will of the majority can be frustrated through=20
the normal operation of the electoral college.

Basic democratic principles, the critics argue, suggest that the people=20
ought to be able to decide directly who should govern them. They point to=
=20
the dispute caused by the election of 1876 and also to the elections of=20
1888 and 2000. In the 1888 election Democrat Grover Cleveland, the=20
defeated candidate, polled about 100,000 more popular votes than=20
Republican Benjamin Harrison. In the states that Cleveland carried,=20
however, he received only 168 electoral votes to Harrison=92s 233. Harrison=
=20
won key states having large numbers of electoral votes by narrow margins=20
and lost states having fewer electoral votes by large margins. In the=20
highly disputed 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore, the losing candidate, won=

more than 500,000 more popular votes than Republican George W. Bush, but=20
Bush won the presidency by capturing 271 electoral votes to Gore=92s 266...=

"Q. What is the Electoral College?

A. The Electoral College is the state-by-state voting system that we use=20
to elect the president and vice president of the United States. It's part=
=20
of our Constitution and was introduced as a compromise to settle the=20
debate over letting the popular vote (aka, the people) choose a president=
=20
(which was thought to be too reckless), versus giving Congress the power=20
to decide alone (which was thought to be too close to a monarchy system of=
=20
government). The result? An Electoral College system that would allow the=
=20
people to vote for electors, who would then cast their votes for the=20
candidates.

Here's how it works: Even though you usually see the names of the=20
candidates on the ballot when you vote for president, you are actually=20
voting for the electors who have pledged to vote for their presidential=20
candidate. (In some states, both names are listed on the ballot.) Together=
=20
as a whole, these electors are referred to as the Electoral College.

Who are the electors? Contrary to popular thought, the Electoral College=20
is NOT made up of your elected officials; this honor usually goes to=20
people who are nominated at party conventions, in primary elections or by=
=20
party organizations. Rules vary from state to state. There are 538=20
electors in all, split among all 50 states and Washington D.C. But not all=
=20
states get the same number of electoral votes. In order to represent the=20
will of the people fairly, the states with the largest populations get the=
=20
most votes. For example, Colorado gets eight, while California gets 54.

On Election Day, the popular votes are cast and counted. But that's only=20
one step. Six weeks later, each state's electors gather to cast a vote on=
=20
behalf of their state as a unit. Unlike the popular vote, each state=20
devotes all of its electoral votes to one party. For example, California=20
can't split its votes and give 30 electoral votes to one party and 24 to=20
the other. One party will receive all 54 votes, regardless of how the=20
popular vote might have been divided. In the end, the candidate who=20
receives an "absolute majority" (270) of the electoral votes -- not the=20
popular vote -- wins the presidency.

Note: Most of the time, electors cast their votes for the candidate who=20
has received the most votes in that particular state. However, there have=
=20
been times when electors have voted contrary to the people's decision,=20
which is entirely legal."

4) History of the Electoral College

http://wv.essortment.com/whathistoryele_rggl.htm

"...When the country was founded over 200 years ago, there was concern by=
=20
the Founding Fathers that the voters weren't smart enough to make "proper"=
=20
decisions when voting for the president. (Well, there was little trust=20
allowing the people vote for their Senator, too, as senate seats were=20
appointed by the individual state's leaders, a practice that continued=20
until 1920.) Despite the fact that very few were given the right to vote=20
in the earliest years -- only male landowners over the age of 21 could=20
vote -- the Founding Fathers decided to write the Electoral College into=20
the Constitution..."

My yellow-stained fortress.  Just read an article about ministry's new =

coming out in June.  I so cant wait, it better be a proper return to =
they're
old sound.  Also in that article I read that Al is gonna be doing a new
Revolting Cocks album.WOO HOO, I've been waiting to hear something new =
from
them for a long time.  Wonder if he'll actually tour as the RevCo.  =
Probably
not, but I can still hope and dream.  Either way so long as I don't miss
Ministry when they come around touring again.  Last 2 times I've missed =
em,
and didn't even know till the day after when someone would mention it to =
me.
Must keep a vigilant eye on their webpage for concert dates.  Is it just =
me
or does they're seem to be a bit of a resurgence of the industrial =
sound?
Seeing KMFDM roll through so much the last couple of years, Einstersien
Neubauten and just yesterday Sister Machine Gun played, kinda upset =
about
missing them, but I'd be hating today if I did go.  Gonna pass on KMFDM =
next
week, only cause the last 2 shows of theirs that I caught really let me
down, the crowds just don't seem that too into the concert anymore, they
just stand there and stare.  What's the fun in that?  Hopefully Skinny =
Puppy
next month brings out the true hardcores and shit gets crazy.*crosses
fingers* Now I hear NIN has a new album coming out soon, and this new
Ministry album (which between now and the 22nd of june you can stream =
the
whole album at VH1.com), and Skinny Puppies new album, anyone out there =
have
any other industrial updates that I might have missed, I love industrial =
and
would greatly appreciate any further detail on any industrial bands.  =
Guess
it all goes back to the 20 year life cycle in which everything repeats
itself every 20 years.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Welcome to my mattress...

Too bad Ministry has sucked royal ass since the album with "New World Order" 
on it. Once they went all metal and did away with the majority of synths 
(live) they turned into a total yawn-fest. The new SKinny Puppy is "eh". Not 
horrible - but by far not exciting. And Trent and NIN (IMH) only really had 
two decent albums - Pretty Hate Machine and Downward Spiral - the other ones 
were riding that same "replace the midi w/guitars" formula, or were just 
plain wussy. YUCK.

Whatever happened to Frontline Assembly? They managed to stay pretty decent 
throughout, and Rhys Fulber's work w/ Fear Factory (for hybrid 
industrial/metal) was pretty good.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] *BSP* OtherWorld - Sat. 6/26

Wicked!!! thats all I can say!

I was just looking at one of my first freaky chakra records the other day.. 
ya know the track "You are in the light" one of his best I think.. and some 
of the acid breaks stuff from mid 90's was good too. The track titles are 
eluding me at the moment..

And Jonah sharp is wicked ambient/experemental producer and not to mention 
Jack from Meat beat!! Helter Skelter it's in my brain!!


So who is going?   :)

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Differences between republic and democracy

Karina,

	Thanks for the info about the Electoral College. But the EC is =
not the =20
key feature that makes the United States a republic rather than a =20
democracy.

	And just to make it plain to the non poli-sci types, the words =20=

"republic" and "democracy" do not have any particular relation to the =20=

Republican and Democratic parties, they are just different models of =20
government.

	In a republic, what the government can do is limited. There are =20=

built-in safeguards for the rights of minorities (and by "minorities" I =20=

am not referring to blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc., though they could =20=

be examples, but of anyone who happens to be in the minority when =20
holding a particular view).

	Under pure democracy, on the other hand, whatever the majority =
wants =20
can be done. If 51% of the people want to have the other 49% loaded =20
onto trains and shipped off to concentration camps, they could legally =20=

do it. (Doesn't mean it would be likely to happen, but it would be =20
legal).

	That's why most people who properly understand these two terms =
prefer =20
that the U.S. be a republic rather than a democracy. The country =20
started out as a republic, but has been moving toward a democracy over =20=

time as the checks and balances that keep government from getting too =20=

powerful have broken down.

	There are a ton of websites out there which further elaborate on =
the =20
differences between a republic and a democracy. Here are a few of them:

	Well, not directly you don't (tell your next door neighbor how to live 
or raise her kids). We do it indirectly by voting for politicians who 
make laws telling her how to live, and by supporting those laws. 
Amounts to the same thing as if we went next door and did it ourselves.

	Not to pick on you, just hoping someone reading this may start to get 
the whole non-aggression thing.

Subject: [sfraves] public service announcement: iron maiden electro ep

there is, out there in the big wide web, an iron maiden tribute record
which consists entirely of electro covers of iron maiden songs. the
cover features a pair of robots strapping the much-beloved iron maiden
zombie into an electric chair.

this record is absolutely AWFUL.

however I felt it would be a disservice to humanity not to make this
list aware of its presence, just in case the one sick little mental
patient on the face of the earth who might actually consider buying
this record just happens to be lurking on here somewhere.

Subject: [sfraves] Fwd: : gmail as file sharing tool

I got this intuitively when I first heard about gmail, a friend does a
much better job of explicitly laying 'the plan' below.

bear in mind that all such swapping needs to be done off-list.

Subject: RG: gmail as file sharing tool
To: @hyperreal.org


Ravers-

As you know, I just got this shiny new gmail account.  There is a
certain feature of gmail that I think many of us will like.

They let you attach files of up to 10 megs.  That's very important.
Most single music tracks will fit in 10 megs. Which means you can
*email music* with gmail.

That fact, along with the 1000 megs they give you for storage, allows
you to use gmail as a kind of p2p client.  You take a CD and rip it to
individual tracks, and send each one on a seperate email.  Poof!  You
just emailed an entire CD.  By using the .cc feature, you can send
that same CD to anyone on a list.  And because it's on Google's
server, you aren't burying somebody.  They can just delete it if they
don't want it.

This adds a new dimension to Internet file trading.  For one, you
share with your friends on a private line.  That kind of file trading
*may* in fact be legal.  Nobody can detect these trades anyway,
because you aren't broadcasting it to the whole Internet.  For two,
it's fast!  Normally a p2p trade is limited by network bandwidth, and
whoever was slowest between you and whoever was serving the file.  Now
it's just you and the Google servers, and they didn't skimp on the
pipes.  As an example, I'm happy to get speeds of 20k/s up and down on
WinMX, even though my broadband connection goes a lot higher.  I sent
myself a CD this morning as a test, and I was seeing 180k/s.  That's
SICK.  And for files over the 10meg limit, there are tools (WinRAR)
that can break large files into smaller parts.

That's it.  Because of the fast access, great privacy, 1000meg storage
and 10meg attachments, not to mention the .cc function, gmail makes an
outstanding file sharing client.  It won't replace your standard
clients, for example you can't search for songs on gmail, but these
new features make it a nice addition to anyone's toolbox.

Oh yeah, gmail accounts are free.  If you have the means, I highly
recommend picking one up.

Joe

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: "Raise the Roof" benefit - tonight

Come on out to Cloud 9 this evening for some great music for a great 
cause. All proceeds from this event will benefit a homeless family 
directly in the form of rent.  The idea is to supplement their income 
until they can get back on their feet, breaking the cycle of 
homelessness, one family at a time.

Check out the 1-by-1 website for more info: http://www.1-by-1.org

I'm on at midnight.  Hope to see you there!

-Philip-

15 bux.. and @ Mezzanine.. I haven't been there yet but the reviews are 
hillarious:

http://sanfrancisco.citysearch.com/profile/911000/?cslink=cs_boc_ew_3_4
The only negative to Mezzanine is that it draws several "professional 
clubber" types - you know who I'm talking about. The type that acts like 
they are better than you and have a right to prime dance floor real estate 
because they have been to all the world's "best clubs and have seen the best 
DJs." They are so into the "subversive club scene" that they are the 
mainstream. I heard some dude say something like "Whoa, this club is so 
alive, I am flashing back to when DJ Vladimir dropped the beats at Le Loco 
in Paris in the July of '99. That changed my life." Barf.

4 of his cd's and they all suck...no energy, doesn't seem to go anywhere =

mixes out of phase.  Guess it's all about how you promote yourself.

Strange, I have the CD Carlcox Live at the Crowbar and its really a =
great set with damn near perfect mixing. My only problem is that the =
type of progressive house/trance/techno/tribal music he plays is rather =
boring to listen to unless you are into drum circles and songs without =
melody or chord progressions. I could see it being a blast to dance to =
though.

BTW - I think in order to really enjoy repatative percussive music on a =
religious level you have to experience a drum circle. By far one of the =
most religious experiences of my life was when I was going to school in =
Cal Poly SLO and we were hanging out at a party near Avila beach, we all =
took our handmaid drums, hiked to a top of a mountain overlooking the =
beach and coastal mountains. We played and danced around for hours. The =
music would peak and then come back down, peak and then come back down. =
We were litteraly screaming at the peaks. It still gives me chills =
today.

Strange, I have the CD Carlcox Live at the Crowbar and its really a great 
set with damn near perfect mixing. My only problem is that the type of 
progressive house/trance/techno/tribal music he plays is rather boring to 
listen to unless you are into drum circles and songs without melody or chord 
progressions. I could see it being a blast to dance to though.

BTW - I think in order to really enjoy repatative percussive music on a 
religious level you have to experience a drum circle. By far one of the most 
religious experiences of my life was when I was going to school in Cal Poly 
SLO and we were hanging out at a party near Avila beach, we all took our 
handmaid drums, hiked to a top of a mountain overlooking the beach and 
coastal mountains. We played and danced around for hours. The music would 
peak and then come back down, peak and then come back down. We were 
litteraly screaming at the peaks. It still gives me chills today.

I've never really dug Carl Cox, he played at one of the first real big
parties I went to in Seattle and his set kinda sucked.  Donald glaude played
right before him and was way better.  He was playing on 3 decks and his
beats were slipping occasionally, I can understand monitoring 3 tables can
be tricky.  But then to have mixes out of phase so one cuts out way to early

It's just called TECHNO (AKA real party music) and what you're not 
understanding is it's not about the song, it's about the track.

I love that CD even though it's a bit loose and one catastrphic mix stays 
off for almost a minute. If I had heard that track live I would probably 
still be having flashbacks.

Carl is off the hook. Even if it gets a bit loose some times (he's the only 
one I give any mixing slack to) and plays the occasional horrible anthemy 
track, he always plays the best music and knows what to do with it. Not like 
the rest of the world's top 10 that have been getting over on limited skill 
and huge name recognition for years. My man is over 40 years old and still 
parties just as hard while he's in the booth as anyone on the floor when he 
plays. He puts in madd work behind the decks and has been getting better 
technicly, and musicly, as he gets older. Carl's obviously staying true to 
his soul too, otherwise he'd be back playing acid & progressive house and 
trance like he used to and everyone else has gone back to for the paycheck. 
My man's the Rolling Stones of dance music.

Besides, he makes mainstream clubber girls dig techno... That's all that 
should really matter.

is it?

Carl Cox is not the only thing that can make mainstream clubber girls
dig techno. Living in Detroit or Germany produces exactly the same
effect, and on a larger scale.

you said:

and I said:
> >is it?

and then I provided a possible counter-argument. and then you said:
> What does that have to do with what I said?

and then I said:
uhh...

and now I'm getting confused.

uhh...

wait a minute -- are you my evil twin or something?

that would explain everything!

Gavin Veritech vs. Giles Soundwave...

is this whole conversation about to devolve into Transformers vs. Robotech?

actually I think you were doing this first, so, uh apologies for

I feel ya on that - although, to be fair, I saw him once at the legendary 
FEVER night in Baltimore (Feelgood & Scott Henry's party), and he was pretty 
on that night. Much housier than str8 bangin' techno - maybe that was why. 
But I have a cd or two of his, and would agree - they blow goats. If anyone 
wants the one "Live @ Space" 2xCD I have, you can smoke me up for it!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] PAT : BSP Carl Cos - Mezzanine July 9th

Too bad most drum circles I have ever been near have been loaded with people 
who have no concept of rhythm whatsoever. That and the reek of unwashed 
bodies slathered in patchouli nauseates me.

*shrug*

Subject: RE: [sfraves] PAT : BSP Carl Cox - Mezzanine July 9th

I'll take Danny Tenaglia over Carl Cox any day of the week. Better mixing, 
better tracks, and he's the frickin' energizer bunny of raving. I saw him 
spin for over 8 hours....insanity. Spun the gamut of edm too. About the only 
thing I didn't hear was breaks or jungle...

all that

and I said:

and then I provided a possible counter-argument. and then you said:

and then I said:
uhh...

and now I'm getting confused.

uhh...

Robotech?

I think Tenaglia did some kind of insane like 17-hour set at the most
recent WMC. and actually speaking of which, does anybody know if his
"Classics" CD is mixed or unmixed? I saw it at some chain store and I
was like woah but I couldn't tell if it was mixed or not.

no way, all the Robotech oafs will be getting into little soap operas
with Minmei and Lisa Hunter and shit. Minmei vs. Lisa Hunter is like
the Mary Ann vs. Ginger of our generation.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PAT : BSP Carl Cox - Mezzanine July 9th

speaking of robotech...i just picked up a bootleg chinese copy of the ENTIRE 
Robotech series (all three sagas).  started watching it last week and i must 
say, all my childhood memories came back.

1)  the creepy fact that Minmei is 15 years old when the series starts...and 
everybody wants a piece of her ass
2)  the ingenious Dadalous attack coordinated my Lisa Hayes where they focus 
the pinpoint shields on the front of the SDF1 and punch the Zentradi ship
3)  the fact that i had a crush on the girls that worked on the SDF1's 
bridge
4)  Max was a fucking bad ass
5)  Myria was a hottie for an alien

only about 15 episodes deep, plenty more to go.  if anyone wants to come 
over and watch some robotech, just lemme know!

Last Epiphany one of my last mixes was some of the fastest, hardest shit I
own at +8 mixed with Deities.

Resurrection coming in stereo... if you say so.
andyw

p.s. And on the good not good thing... Psalm 69 was their last decent
album, but I wouldn't say everything before that was good ("with Sympathy"
is on a lot of people's worst albums of all time lists).  Land of Rape and
Honey is probably the best in terms of just completely blowing my mind
when it came out, the production on "Mind" is was amazing when it came out
as well (Thieves by Ministry and Tim Omen by Skinny Puppy just slayed on
using samplers to play stuff that couldn't possibly be played on real
drums and guitars in a way that was immediate and accessible, helping
establish digital samplers as more than just a tool for theft).

LORH was their best - I agree on "With Sympathy". Always made me wonder what 
happened between those two lp's tho - the difference is night and day. Alien

Ah yes, and it allowed for the creative use of dental drills as musical 
instruments...

If you put Ministry and Revolting Cocks in the same chronological 
discography, you can hear the progression from Twitch to Rape and
Honey much more smoothly...

Now damn, what ever happened to my Wax Trax! shirt?

Ministry, Wax Trax!, and house...

they were putting something in the water in Chicago back in those
days, man. sounds like a good thing, but you weren't there, man. I was
there, for real, y0. all those industrial kids were actually bringing
power tools into school and having impromptu jam sessions in the
hallways. it was fucking crazy, man. I was THERE. smashing on lockers
and waving drills in the air. it was wild!

uhh...yeah...I was, uh, like THERE...man...

hey, i've been unsubbed for a while and i gotta tell ya, nothing made
coming back feel more like home than having that first Geri Dahl post
come flying over the transom and landing in my brain's lap.

in these uncertain times it was one of the more reassuring things I've
had happen that the werld hadn't gone completely off its rocker.

in a weird way, i kinda missed her

she's totally innocuous and not a troll and not an instigator and
pretty harmless and she doesn't spew that right-wing vitriol that some
"ravers" on other lists and here do.

>From what I can see it's the rabid-foaming at the mouth Bush lovers
that have issues with mental illness, in a schiz sort of way.

I mean c'mon, their heroes in this Bush Admin are the very same ones
that want to get them locked up, courtesy of the RAVE Act.

If there was ever a group that needed to 'check their premises,' it's them.

I'm waiting with bated breath for Geri's next installment.

--part1_1d2.23f5b6d2.2e05ac97_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit


     shouts out to the telic people for making good on their quest to provide 
quality venues and insuring the successful future of bay area raves. their 
latest location 'TELIC' opening up only roughly a month ago has already garnered 
a small cult following. the space is reminiscent to the former large 
warehouse ill-named "second and crack" aka second and jackson in oakland ( the venue 
owners i believe were not to be blamed for the fall BTW.. excessive flyering 
outside the venue, littering, graffiti, fed up city officials, and promoting to 
the wrong demographic have all been cited as reasons for second & jackson's 
demise. fun while it lasted `;)), yet TELIC i feel doesn't share the same 
psychosomatic grime. 

     The TELIC space is a clean space with a certain sense of class and is 
easily rocked by small affordable soundsystems. so far the vibe is of nostalgia 
for warehouse raves in the past ( the mid 90s were ten years ago?!) and a hair 
of apprehension on how long will such a great space last. but as to keep 
their declarations public, sidewalk chalk is/was provided for the graffers and 
staff early on for those who felt the need to express their beliefs or marks. the 
telic staff, by means of the chalked up walls, also seemed to want to to let 
the patrons know that the ethos and morality of rave is present with Peace 
Love Unity and Respect. The vibe of the space for the moment is actually governed 
by those principles and no haters seem to ever be present.

     i see the only drawbacks to the space are the fact that so many ravers/ 
promoters still have a bad taste in their mouths left over from the tongue 
chewing massives in past years to trust such a venue that might just seem to them 
like another 'happy trance cavern'. although most of the music heard there is 
trance and its relatives, the space has so much potential for other genres to 
flourish in a space for which those genres were originally designed. specific 
genres including house breaks and techno seem to stand out the most in a 
space where the reverb is a major factor in the space's charm & appeal (think 
pro-jex, Spank & LA Williams tracks). trance, which already has a fair amount of 
reverb on it, finds it's emotional content deadened by being cancelled out by 
the space's natural reverb and makes it sound wayyy too clean and flat. sharp 
funky beats seem to play off of that space and add to the whole environment 
(don't get me wrong, some of my best friends play trance`;P).

      as an example donalde glaude showed up from seemingly nowhere as a 
follow up to his ruby skye gig last night to rally 4:30 am heads back up into a 
stomping frenzy. (props to audio metamorphosis et-al.) his techno/prog-house 
beats banging the walls, -accentuating his style with the usual hypnotic groove 
that most of today's electronic music seems to lack. 
     The future for the space is unknown, but for sure there TELIC is a great 
venue that just begs for suitable promotion by people who respect TELIC's 
ideals and can offer a space for local and international talent. in short, 
TELIC's the kind of space that makes me happy to be a raver again. `;)

And they said that "Groove: the movie" had to be fake since Digweed
"would never spin a closing set at a $3 underground".

Well I guess having Donald came close with his slammin'closing set at a
$5 underound.

To all those still holding onto the idea that good, inexpensive,
excessively vibified parties no longer exist - poop on you! 

Props to Telic & their associates...

Dina/Dragn'fly, last night at Telic you told me the same thing about the  
movie Groove and John Digweed playing an underground (which, I admit, seemed  
like one of the few unlikely things in the movie) and how we were being treated  
to a very similar thing. Donald Glaude rocks!  Wow ... he looked like he  was 
having a FANTASTIC time. He was spinning with his elbows and behind his  back, 
and working the mixer with his NOSE !  I'd seen him spin a couple  times but 
never up close like he was last night.Even at 6 am he had people  jumping up 
in the air. I'm sure everybody went home happy!  

Three cheers for Donald, all the DJs, and the Telic crew!  
wow
amazed  
:)
John

Subject: RE: [sfraves] don't sleep on TELIC

"To all those still holding onto the idea that good, inexpensive,
excessively vibified parties no longer exist - poop on you!"

Amen sista!!! It reminded me of the old 2nd/Jackson days like sean said. The 
vibe was incredible from the start! Donald rocked that place, it was 5am and 
it was still goin. People were getting ready to leave, then all of a sudden 
you hear people cheering and clapping, it's Donald walking up to the decks. 
Props to EVERYONE involved. Thank you for the memory,  I had a blast 
playing.

I'm surprised PAILHEAD hasn't been brought up since we're all waxing
nostalgic. Hehehe - I said WAXING - and it was in reference to WAXTRAX
music. MUAHAHAHA.

But yea - Pailhead still rocks my ass - I listen to my CD at least a couple
times per month...who woulda thunk Ian MAckaye from Minor Threat/Fugazi fame
woulda worked w/Alien on anything. And since we're talking (aor at least I'M
talking) about punk singers and industrial musicians - can't forget to
mention LARD (Jello Biafra & the Ministry/Wax Trax peeps). "Can god fill
teeth?"

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
"hey, ig, what are you writing about right now."
"i am not writing, i am thinking."
"what are you thinking about?"
"do you think that you have to be politically and socially blind to express a point of view as an artist?"
"i don't think i should answer that, ig."
"why not?"
"it might be a hot topic, but it isn't as great as a really cool catch phrase or just the word SEX or anything that might imply bodily excretions."
"oh, okay." :)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: KZSU Summer Solstice marathon IS ON!

Well, I've ended up being less and less involved with the Solstice
Marathons on KZSU, letting Jacki-O take the reins instead (and
concentraiting on the Equinox Marathons myself.)  Still, I will probably
stop by for at least a LITTLE bit (how can you NOT!?!) Join us if you
wish.  Simply give the station a call to find out how to get there.
650-723-9010.  Again, 24 hrs isn't enough, so we're bringing it to ya
for 30 hrs once again.

On the lineup this time around are:
Random Noise
Neon Leon
Jai Young
Dan Gerber
Amit
Paul
Joel Conway
Warren
JJ Islas
Adnan
M3
Anthony Garlic & various DJs from Green Gorilla Lounge

Should be stellar!!   If you can't make it down to party in person, at
least be sure to listen in; 90.1 FM or online at
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Details at http://www.jcthedj.com

Keep it real!!

Subject: [sfraves] review: shazbot "the control structure"

It's been almost 3 years since I bought my last techno record, but I 
still appreciate the music.  I ran through Sean's (aka Shazbot) latest 
CD, "The Control Structure" twice before being totally captivated by the 
seamless fusion of soulful, minimal techno and deep, techy house.  I say 
it took two times because the first time I listened to it I was at work 
listening at low levels through crappy computer speakers.  The second 
time I was able to experience the low rolling, bluesy bass notes of the 
first track "Gbbbump" by Jeff Samuel continuing on through a well 
contemplated set of peaks and valleys like the high speed straightaways 
and enigmatic corkscrews of a well engineered rollercoaster ride.  The 
heavy stompers, tracks: 6. "Drowning," by Jeremy P. Caulfield,  9. "Clip 
Zwei," by Oliver Hacke and  11. "Outhouse ( Beaty Tool Mix)" were at the 
top of my "grooving in the car on the way to work" list -- reaffirming 
my belief that time travel *is* possible. "The Control Structure" 
blurred the lines between techno and SF deep house, extracting the raw 
essence of each and drawing a whole new mental picture. 

The good news is that I think you may still be able to get a copy.

--=====================_22686040==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Last night I decided to once again step outside the musical treadmill I 
sometimes feel I'm on and experience something different.  This weekend it 
was the Dhamaal Sound System's "Asian Massive" at Club 6.  The featured 
performer was Sukhawat, one half of the New Delhi-based group MIDIval 
Punidtz, supported on the dancefloor by Janaka Selekta's EDM interpretation 
of his songs.

Sukhawat's songs reflect a tradition of Indian music that goes back to the 
16th century Sham Chorasi school of music in the court of Akber the Great.

There were abundant drummers, a Pakistani folksinger, Sukhawat Ali Khan, 
and DJ Cheb I Sabbah.

The music and evening were truly amazing.  These performers have stepped 
outside of traditional genre paradigms and focus, instead, on a "theme," in 
this case traditional South Asian folk music and beats morphed into 
electronic dance music.  Wonderful.  The beats were all over the 
place:  breaks, hip hop, drum 'n' bass, house and some trance in the mix.

The venue was packed.  I had for some reason expected a sort of New Age 
vibe and crowd.  What we found was authentically South Asian:  a heavy 
representation of the local Indian community.  Most of my personal 
experiences with the Indian community in the Bay have been 
business-oriented, but I am familiar with the ancient traditions of dance 
in this culture.  I also enjoy Indian films  --  the ones where people 
begin singing and dancing  joyfully to beats at the slightest 
provocation.  The Dhamaal dancers seemed to reflect those traditions, 
albeit a 21st century interpretation:  unselfconscious, sensual, and 
energetic.  There were dancers in traditional garb, some with turbans, as 
well as those in more hip gear, often with South Asian embellishment.

For a community that dances together regularly these folks are very open 
and friendly to newbies.  We made more new friends Saturday night than we 
normally do in our regular party circuit.

Props to Angel, the owner of Club 6.  He loves dance music, DJs himself, 
and brings much needed diversity and innovation to the club scene in San 
Francisco.

Love,

Apollo

Dhamaal does a monthly at Club 6 as well as other events, Philip.  Check 
out their website:  http://dhamaalsf.com/v1/index.html#  I'm going to 
attend the next one.

I'm not sure if Parag was playing the Sarod this weekend or not, but he
does a great classical Indian music show on KZSU on Thur. afternoons
from 1p-3p (just 2 hrs. after my show ends.)  Generally not the fusion
that happens at Dhamaal however.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] review: shazbot "the control structure"


Damn there guy, I just space out and see spots when I listen to that mix.
And I mean that in the best way.

Good stuff, definitely a strong addition for anybody who likes a minimal
tech interpretation of house track flow and subby bass.  Clean, tasteful,
yet full of sounds blended in a way that sound fresh and increase in
dimension with repeated listenings... and it's very refreshing to hear a
mix that isn't shooting for a midnight peak hour slot... Shazbot's style
aims at a different target, a slot in a dark room somewhere as night gives
way to predawn or maybe last call, a pleasant re-entry for the dancefloor
faithful.

goodstuff!

btw,

there's also a pacific sound party and a great sf-vibe (my crew) party

Libertarian presidential candidate: private space launch shows the=20
Libertarian solution in action

AUSTIN, TEXAS =96- Libertarian presidential nominee Michael Badnarik=20
points to SpaceShipOne=92s successful flight as an example of the power=20=

of the Libertarian solution.

=93SpaceShipOne=92s successful flight shows the world a dramatic example =
of=20
how private enterprise outperforms government,=94 declared Badnarik.=20
=93NASA=92s space plane designs cost enormous amounts of money and took=20=

decades to develop. Free enterprise did the same job better with only=20
$20 million dollars -- because government is profoundly inefficient=20
whereas the free market is amazingly efficient.=94

SpaceShipOne=92s launch story perfectly illustrates the Libertarian=20
principles of strictly limited government, protection of private=20
property, and the power of free enterprise. Built by famed aircraft=20
designer Burt Rutan=92s company Scaled Composites, and funded by $20=20
million from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, the completely reusable=20
SpaceShipOne is designed to compete for the $10 million Ansari X Prize.=20=

The contest organizers modeled their challenge after the Orteig Prize=20
that spurred aviator Lindbergh=92s famous flight. The X Prize mission=20
statement reads, in part:

=93We believe that spaceflight should be open to all -- not just an =
elite=20
cadre of government employees or the ultra-rich. We believe that=20
commercial forces will bring spaceflight into a publicly affordable=20
range. We will use our best efforts to achieve this goal.=94

Badnarik also noted how the SpaceShipOne project illustrates the=20
economic drag of government regulation. =93We had the first space planes=20=

many decades ago. We didn=92t have commercial space flight until today=20=

because of government interference. =46rom harassing high-power rocketry=20=

enthusiasts, to trying to stop Dennis Tito=92s private flight on a=20
Russian rocket, jealous government bureaucrats have stifled innovation=20=

in space. SpaceShipOne=92s launch shows what private enterprise can do=20=

when government gets out of the way.=94

Former Libertarian presidential candidate Barry Hess and Libertarian=20
talk radio host Ernest Hancock attended the launch. Rutan reportedly=20
handed the pilot a sign brought to the launch by Hancock shortly after=20=

the craft landed which read "SpaceShipOne - Government Zero."

Libertarian Party Presidential Nominee Michael Badnarik expects to be=20
on the ballot in all 50 states, more than Ralph Nader. [For third party=20=

verification contact Richard Winger, Editor, Ballot Access News - (415)=20=

<bold><bigger>Libertarian presidential candidate: private space launch
shows the Libertarian solution in action</bigger></bold>


AUSTIN, TEXAS =96- Libertarian presidential nominee Michael Badnarik
points to SpaceShipOne=92s successful flight as an example of the power
of the Libertarian solution.


=93SpaceShipOne=92s successful flight shows the world a dramatic example
of how private enterprise outperforms government,=94 declared Badnarik.
=93NASA=92s space plane designs cost enormous amounts of money and took
decades to develop. Free enterprise did the same job better with only
$20 million dollars -- because government is profoundly inefficient
whereas the free market is amazingly efficient.=94


SpaceShipOne=92s launch story perfectly illustrates the Libertarian
principles of strictly limited government, protection of private
property, and the power of free enterprise. Built by famed aircraft
designer Burt Rutan=92s company Scaled Composites, and funded by $20
million from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, the completely reusable
SpaceShipOne is designed to compete for the $10 million Ansari X
Prize. The contest organizers modeled their challenge after the Orteig
Prize that spurred aviator Lindbergh=92s famous flight. The X Prize
mission statement reads, in part:


=93We believe that spaceflight should be open to all -- not just an
elite cadre of government employees or the ultra-rich. We believe that
commercial forces will bring spaceflight into a publicly affordable
range. We will use our best efforts to achieve this goal.=94


Badnarik also noted how the SpaceShipOne project illustrates the
economic drag of government regulation. =93We had the first space planes
many decades ago. We didn=92t have commercial space flight until today
because of government interference. =46rom harassing high-power rocketry
enthusiasts, to trying to stop Dennis Tito=92s private flight on a
Russian rocket, jealous government bureaucrats have stifled innovation
in space. SpaceShipOne=92s launch shows what private enterprise can do
when government gets out of the way.=94


Former Libertarian presidential candidate Barry Hess and Libertarian
talk radio host Ernest Hancock attended the launch. Rutan reportedly
handed the pilot a sign brought to the launch by Hancock shortly after
the craft landed which read "<italic>SpaceShipOne</italic> -
Government Zero."


Libertarian Party Presidential Nominee Michael Badnarik expects to be
on the ballot in all 50 states, more than Ralph Nader. [For third

Hey, that kinda reminds me of this!

<http://www.astronomia-carj.com.br/circulares/image001.jpg>

Yuri Gagarin's manned space flight was hailed by many as a triumph of
communism over capitalism. I wouldn't be too quick to say that a single
event like this resolves such a complex issue.

Cheerio,

I always wanted my own Airworlf. Just leave the drunkard pilot out of the
picture next time. If it came down to a choice between Airwolf and a time
machine I would have to take the time machine. Just imagine being able to go
back in time and prove religion right or wrong and answer some of history's
most pressing questions. =D

I'll be at Otherworld.

I love me some breaks - but I often wonder why it's cool all of a sudden for 
breaks scenesters to jock the punk rock meet clubber look. I'd rather sink 
my $$ into vinyl, not clothing, lol.

Whatever works tho - I just want the damn beats!

Cyberonics' Neuroelectronics Device to Relieve Depression

<http://www.corante.com/brainwaves/archives/003842.html>Neuroelectronics 
device manufacturer <http://www.cyberonics.com/>Cyberonics received 
preliminary approval for a surgical implant to 
<http://www.cyberonics.com/5whatsnew_fs.html>treat severe depression. It is 
the first time an implanted device has been recommended for the treatment 
of a psychiatric disorder.

Using a technique known as <http://www.vnstherapy.com/aboutvnsfs.html>vagus 
nerve stimulation, the implanted device uses electrodes implanted in the 
neck to activate brain regions that are believed to regulate mood. The 
involves connecting a wire to the left vagus nerve in the side of the neck; 
a battery is implanted high in the left chest or under the armpit, and the 
amount of current can be regulated externally. Typically, the implant sends 
a 30-second pulse of current followed by a five-minute pause, 24 hours a day.

The 
<http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/cdrh04.html#NeurologicalDevices>Neurological 
Devices Panel of FDA's Medical Devices Advisory Committee voted 5 to 2 to 
recommend approval with conditions of Cyberonics' VNS Therapy™ System "as 
an adjunctive long-term treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for 
patients over the age of 18 who are experiencing a major depressive episode 
that has not had an adequate response to four or more adequate 
antidepressant treatments. The stock, CYBX, 
<http://biz.yahoo.com/fool/040616/1087418820_1.html>surged 70% on the news.

While it is clear from the committee's recommendation that several 
<http://www.corante.com/brainwaves/archives/cat_emoticeuticals.html>emoticeuticals 
to treat depression must first be tried, the recommendation highlights an 
important trend in the emerging neurotechnology industry: neuroceutical 
makers and 
<http://www.corante.com/brainwaves/archives/000236.html>neuroelectronics 
manufacturers will increasingly compete for market share as they strive 
towards developing for better tools to treat mental illnesses. Indeed, 
Cyberonics already has pilot studies underway to evaluate 
<http://www.vnstherapy.com/>VNS Therapy as a potential treatment for 
anxiety disorders, Alzheimer's disease and chronic headache/migraine.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

i say, keep wearing what you're wearing.  fashion is cool, but functionality 
is tops for me.  and yes, i'm still wearing the $2 tshirts that i bought in 
china and knock-off shoes and you can't stop me.

Hey, you can get $2 t-shirts here; 5 for $9.99, all over the place. :)

Oh, and keepin on keepin on is fine, but it's a slow influence for
change I'd say.  And the flamability issue is probably on point, but
then you really haven't changed the direction of the other peeps, you've
just removed them from the equation.  I'm still trying to figure out how
to accomplish REAL change.  Maybe the OG equation of having a drag queen
at the door is the answer.  I didn't think of running that one by Sister
Gina Tonic last Sunday.

Slow ticket sales, huh?  Well, when you exterminate the middle class,
you've got to expect some consequences.

there should be a hit out on him by now.

maybe a few deck-jumpers for hire?  we could sabotage his sets and 
spread the word of his spamming ways.

In all fairness (and you guys know how I love to bash peeps), DJ 7 is a
pretty nice guy. However his email habits are inexcusable; I hear you on
this Chris; 7 is one of the biggest pains-in-the-arse when it comes to
unsubscribing.

I just think Chris should unless some Techno fury on 'em.

Lollapalooza has allways been a quality event. I would much rather go
to lolla than any other big event.

Danny Howell's cd is a masterpiece - a great dj to begin this new GU series.

For those who like Danny's compilation, Lee Burridge just released his 24:7
comp also.

Lee Burridge's mix isn't all that great, IMO. The "day" CD is good, a
nice selection of well-mixed house and tech-house, but the "night" CD
does absolutely nothing for me. Progressive crap.

> Speaking of which - when the fuck is TYRANT coming through? They are
> so damn good live.

Fuck yeah, though I prefer Craig Richards on his own. His Fabric 15
double CD mix (actually titled "Tyrant") is THE SHIT. Glitchy, abstract,
deep tech on one disc, and dirty funk and electro on the other. Tracks
by Michael Mayer, Carsten Jost, Falko Brocksieper, Morgan Geist, Joakim,
Ectomorph... you just can't go wrong.

And what's really great about this mix is that all the tracks aren't
limited-release promos that won't be out for years. Most of the stuff is
from the last 4 years, but there are a couple of pre-2000 gems as well
(check the Morgan Geist and Minimal Man tracks--both from '97, but still
*so* relevant!). Highly recommended mind-expanding material, this mix.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] CD review Danny Howell's 24:7

I picked up this CD when it first came out being a howells fan and I have to 
say I was less then impressed. Of Course the mixng and production was tight 
but the tracks just didnt move me that much. I have the earlier works buy 
him and all his old CD's are just running.. I know this was a bit more 
"Artistic" in the respect of the ambient downtempo-esque house tunes but 
even those are boring (IMO) a good downtempo breaks ambient core type shit 
is Nick warren live in Raykejvit (SP)? GU series. I was a bit disappointed 
with the howells 24/7 matter of fact I only listened to it about 3 times and 
have never played it again. But he is no doubt still the man.

Has anybody heard the double CD by Kazell (sp)? that dood out of LA that is 
supposed to be pretty wicked. Most of the prog boards gave it good reviews 
but I still have not picked up my copy yet.

But the old/new Jedi mind tracks album is ok.. Violent by desing.. Not as 
good as visions of gandhi but ok.

That is about it on the CD front for me thus far..

I have heard the same.  However, if I were to save your life then decide to
take a big $hit on your pillow, the fact is that I still took a big ass smelly
$hit on your pillow.

We all play the same game as far as promoting goes, but mailing list abuse is
one of the more annoying things that one can do.  Kind of like taking a
greasy, green/brownish-green dump on my pillow.

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Bush administration wants to screen all U.S. citizens for mental illness

Source: http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=3D39078


Bush To Screen Population For Mental Illness

Sweeping initiative links diagnoses to treatment with specific drugs
Posted: June 21, 2004 5:00 p.m. Eastern


=A9 2004 WorldNetDaily.com

President Bush plans to unveil next month a sweeping mental health
initiative that recommends screening for every citizen and promotes
the use of expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs favored
by supporters of the administration.

The New Freedom Initiative, according to a progress report, seeks to
integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community by providing
"services in the community, rather than institutions," the British
Medical Journal reported.

Critics say the plan protects the profits of drug companies at the
expense of the public.

The initiative began with Bush's launch in April 2002 of the New
Freedom Commission on Mental Health, which conducted a "comprehensive
study of the United States mental health service delivery system."

The panel found that "despite their prevalence, mental disorders
often go undiagnosed" and recommended comprehensive mental health=20
screening
for "consumers of all ages," including preschool children.

The commission said, "Each year, young children are expelled from
preschools and childcare facilities for severely disruptive behaviors
and emotional disorders."

Schools, the panel concluded, are in a "key position" to screen the
52 million students and 6 million adults who work at the schools.

The commission recommended that the screening be linked with
"treatment and supports," including "state-of-the-art treatments"
using "specific medications for specific conditions."

The Texas Medication Algorithm Project, or TMAP, was held up by the
panel as a "model" medication treatment plan that "illustrates an
evidence-based practice that results in better consumer outcomes."

The TMAP -- started in 1995 as an alliance of individuals from the
pharmaceutical industry, the University of Texas and the mental
health and corrections systems of Texas -- also was praised by the=20
American
Psychiatric Association, which called for increased funding to
implement the overall plan.

But the Texas project sparked controversy when a Pennsylvania
government employee revealed state officials with influence over the
plan had received money and perks from drug companies who stand to
gain from it.

Allen Jones, an employee of the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector
General says in his whistleblower report the "political/pharmaceutical
alliance" that developed the Texas project, which promotes the use of
newer, more expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs, was
behind the recommendations of the New Freedom Commission, which were
"poised to consolidate the TMAP effort into a comprehensive national
policy to treat mental illness with expensive, patented medications
of questionable benefit and deadly side effects, and to force private
insurers to pick up more of the tab."

Jones points out, according to the British Medical Journal, companies
that helped start the Texas project are major contributors to Bush's
election funds. Also, some members of the New Freedom Commission have
served on advisory boards for these same companies, while others have
direct ties to TMAP.

Eli Lilly, manufacturer of olanzapine, one of the drugs recommended
in the plan, has multiple ties to the Bush administration, BMJ says. The
elder President Bush was a member of Lilly's board of directors and
President Bush appointed Lilly's chief executive officer, Sidney
Taurel, to the Homeland Security Council.

Of Lilly's $1.6 million in political contributions in 2000, 82
percent went to Bush and the Republican Party.

Another critic, Robert Whitaker, journalist and author of "Mad in
America," told the British Medical Journal that while increased
screening "may seem defensible," it could also be seen as "fishing
for customers."

Exorbitant spending on new drugs "robs from other forms of care such
as job training and shelter program," he said.

However, a developer of the Texas project, Dr. Graham Emslie, defends
screening.

"There are good data showing that if you identify kids at an earlier
age who are aggressive, you can intervene ... and change their
trajectory."

Hmm let's see... He spams the fuck out of people, and he's "pushy with
the ladies". That doesn't sound like somebody worth "getting to know".
Unless, of course, you need some help with direct marketing, or you're a
rapist.

Or you're one of those chicks that needs an overly dominant male figure in
their life due to a weak or absent father figure while growing up...

Pushy with the ladies == egotistical fuck with small prick.

I'm imagining that but it's not really doing anything for me. Too Bill
& Ted's Excellent Adventure. But time travel probably is the better
choice all the same, because if you get a time machine, all you have
to do is go back in time to about 1600 or so, to the founding of some
extremely long-lived Swiss bank or whatever, and open an anonymous
numbered checking account with an initial deposit of like one guilder
(or some other penny-equivalent deposit). Then you can come back to
the present day and voila, the magic of compound interest means you
are a multi-gazillionaire. Then you can just buy a helicopter.

look out everybody. Mercury is trine Uranus, and I don't have to tell
you what that means.

admittedly, telling you what that means would probably be the
neighborly thing to do, since you probably don't know, and I'm the one
who brought the topic up in the first place, but I don't have to, so I
don't think I will. good luck, and watch out for flying hamsters.

(not that I'm saying you're actually gonna see any.)

  That would be the shit if Lee and Craig came out together...... but it probably won't happen any time soon.   
 
 I guess if I want to see them play together I'll have to get my ass over to London and hit up Fabric........ But since I'm pretty much dreaming anyways as that  isn't going to happen anytime soon it would be even better if Tyrant was playing in one room and Tyler Stadius and Terry Francis were playing in the other room. Not too realistic, but hey I can dream can't I ?

"Unfortunately Carl Cox was recently taken ill and the Doctor has told him 
he
cannot fly and to rest. This means that 3 weeks of gigs have now been 
cancelled
to give him time to recover, in order for him to be fighting fit for the 
summer.

Carl would like to express his sadness at this situation and he hopes to
make up the cancelled shows in the near future."

-&e->Bush To Screen Population For Mental Illness
-&e->
-&e->Sweeping initiative links diagnoses to treatment with specific drugs
-&e->Posted: June 21, 2004 5:00 p.m. Eastern
-&e->
-&e->
-&e->=A9 2004 WorldNetDaily.com
-&e->
-&e->President Bush plans to unveil next month a sweeping mental health
-&e->initiative that recommends screening for every citizen and promotes
-&e->the use of expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs favored
-&e->by supporters of the administration.
-&e->
-&e->The New Freedom Initiative, according to a progress report, seeks to
-&e->integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community by providing
-&e->"services in the community, rather than institutions," the British
-&e->Medical Journal reported.
-&e->
-&e->Critics say the plan protects the profits of drug companies at the
-&e->expense of the public.
-&e->
-&e->The initiative began with Bush's launch in April 2002 of the New
-&e->Freedom Commission on Mental Health, which conducted a "comprehensive
-&e->study of the United States mental health service delivery system."
-&e->
-&e->The panel found that "despite their prevalence, mental disorders
-&e->often go undiagnosed" and recommended comprehensive mental health
-&e->screening
-&e->for "consumers of all ages," including preschool children.
-&e->
-&e->The commission said, "Each year, young children are expelled from
-&e->preschools and childcare facilities for severely disruptive behaviors
-&e->and emotional disorders."
-&e->
-&e->Schools, the panel concluded, are in a "key position" to screen the
-&e->52 million students and 6 million adults who work at the schools.
-&e->
-&e->The commission recommended that the screening be linked with
-&e->"treatment and supports," including "state-of-the-art treatments"
-&e->using "specific medications for specific conditions."
-&e->
-&e->The Texas Medication Algorithm Project, or TMAP, was held up by the
-&e->panel as a "model" medication treatment plan that "illustrates an
-&e->evidence-based practice that results in better consumer outcomes."
-&e->
-&e->The TMAP -- started in 1995 as an alliance of individuals from the
-&e->pharmaceutical industry, the University of Texas and the mental
-&e->health and corrections systems of Texas -- also was praised by the
-&e->American
-&e->Psychiatric Association, which called for increased funding to
-&e->implement the overall plan.
-&e->
-&e->But the Texas project sparked controversy when a Pennsylvania
-&e->government employee revealed state officials with influence over the
-&e->plan had received money and perks from drug companies who stand to
-&e->gain from it.
-&e->
-&e->Allen Jones, an employee of the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector
-&e->General says in his whistleblower report the "political/pharmaceutical
-&e->alliance" that developed the Texas project, which promotes the use of
-&e->newer, more expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs, was
-&e->behind the recommendations of the New Freedom Commission, which were
-&e->"poised to consolidate the TMAP effort into a comprehensive national
-&e->policy to treat mental illness with expensive, patented medications
-&e->of questionable benefit and deadly side effects, and to force private
-&e->insurers to pick up more of the tab."
-&e->
-&e->Jones points out, according to the British Medical Journal, companies
-&e->that helped start the Texas project are major contributors to Bush's
-&e->election funds. Also, some members of the New Freedom Commission have
-&e->served on advisory boards for these same companies, while others have
-&e->direct ties to TMAP.
-&e->
-&e->Eli Lilly, manufacturer of olanzapine, one of the drugs recommended
-&e->in the plan, has multiple ties to the Bush administration, BMJ says. T=
he
-&e->elder President Bush was a member of Lilly's board of directors and
-&e->President Bush appointed Lilly's chief executive officer, Sidney
-&e->Taurel, to the Homeland Security Council.
-&e->
-&e->Of Lilly's $1.6 million in political contributions in 2000, 82
-&e->percent went to Bush and the Republican Party.
-&e->
-&e->Another critic, Robert Whitaker, journalist and author of "Mad in
-&e->America," told the British Medical Journal that while increased
-&e->screening "may seem defensible," it could also be seen as "fishing
-&e->for customers."
-&e->
-&e->Exorbitant spending on new drugs "robs from other forms of care such
-&e->as job training and shelter program," he said.
-&e->
-&e->However, a developer of the Texas project, Dr. Graham Emslie, defends
-&e->screening.
-&e->
-&e->"There are good data showing that if you identify kids at an earlier
-&e->age who are aggressive, you can intervene ... and change their
-&e->trajectory."

"consumers of all ages".  Says it all right there.

Sometimes I think I live in bizarroland, where up is down, left is
right, and Bush is in the Whitehouse.

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Damn.... that's a bummer.

I wasn't looking exactly looking forward to this Lollapalooza revival.  
That lineup is resoundingly mediocre, so far as I'm concerned.  But I 
have fond memories of Lollapaloozas past.... with lineups that included 
the likes of The Smashing Pumpkins, Rage Against the Machine, The 
Ramones, Rancid, the MMBTs, and so on.

Anyone know more; like WHO exactly is the asswipe who is suing them to 
stop the tour?

its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

oh shit that's funny!

i used to live across the street from Brain Wash, and after seeing some 
of the wacky shit that goes down in that place, the thought of someone 
in a Batman costume doing their laundry there seems pretty normal.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: no lollapalooza :(

I think the lineup is way too backward looking for a festival show. The
old folks (ahem) don't want to battle the crowds all day to see bands
they've most likely seen before. When Lollapalooza started in 91, the
headliners were Jane's Addiction, Ice-T, Nine Inch Nails, Rollins Band...
all acts that were in their prime back then.

This year's headliners were mostly bands from that same era, ie. more than
10 years ago! Even Modest Mouse, whose new album has finally broken
through, have been around since 93. This lineup was put together by
promoters who booked their favorite bands, but they missed the demographic
boat IMO. The fact that Coachella sold out both days for the first time
(50,000 a day @ $75 a pop) goes to show that people will go to big shows,
if you give them something special.

I speak from the heart when I say I am truly sad that you're going, as 
you're one of the nicest guys I have met here, you've always treated me with 
the utmost respect, helped me out getting gigs and whatnot, and been a 
sincere friend. You've also contributed to the "scene" we all love, and that 
is always admirable - as you're a doer, not a talker.

I wish you and Jenny all the best in the great Southwest, and hope to see 
you again (after Thursday night) real soon!!!!

Jack the DJ pirate is leaving me!!!!

Just letting you know that you'll be missed by me, but I'm sure that =

close and we're both destined to be the number one American progressive =
dance DJ(you) and producer(me) someday soon. No, really.

Party on!

Its not just the crowds, its the bands themselves.  yeah, I used to be
a huge Morrissey fan, never missed his concerts, ect.  Then I got
out of high school and realized that life doesn't suck.

Do you know what I would go to now?  A hip-hop-alooza.  I think hip-hop
is the new Alternative.

Good luck with the punctuation! And to commemorate your new life
adventure, here's a collection of classic Jack Triumph quotes.

On women:

On dancing:

> agree is awesome. Other than that, dancing makes me envy cripples.

> I like to dance, and I dj.

On the state of American government:

> 8 years of trickle down politics, open borders, failed social
> programs, focusing on bj's instead of work, and overall bleeding heart
> liberalism got us in this spot folks; Bush didn't create this, he
> inherited it.

On the Iraqi war:

> The UN is a socialist organization hell-bent on passing their own
> agenda.

> I have no problem turning countries into huge Wal-Mart's

> We are not citizens of the world, we are American's. 

On social welfare:

Thanks for the good times, Jack!

Peyote Case Decided by Utah Supreme Court

Peyote is a psychotropic cactus that has been used as a religious sacrament 
for centuries. Today, the Utah Supreme Court ruled that a federal exemption 
for peyote-using members of the Native American Church must be interpreted 
as applying to non-Indians and Indians alike. Utah's Controlled Substances 
Act incorporates the federal exemption, ruled the court, and because the 
plain language of the federal exemption is not limited to Indians, it must 
be read as applicable to Linda and James Mooney, both of whom are 
non-Indian members of the Native American Church.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: no lollapalooza :(

i respectfully disagree toy - hip hop is the new "Hair Metal"....and as hair 
metal fell, so shall commercial hip-hop.  and frankly, i can't wait.

mark my words, in 10 years MTV will have a show "It came from 1996-2006" 
where they show all the essential parts to every single lame hip-hop video 
and song.  bitches, bling, rims, champagne, jerseys, jiggling, precious 
metal orthodontia, and mansions, cars, boats, and helicopters rented for the 
shoot.

commercial hip hop is the enemy.  viva the techno revolution!

:)

You actually saved that shit? You need a job or something - sounds like you 
have a bit too much free time on yer hands slim.

For the record, Jack and I are world's apart politically - but i know him, 
and I know that half of what you just posted (if not more ) was SARCASM.

Get a grip holmes - and lay of the haterade.

I think I love you. (no sarcasm - you summed up my thinking on the subject 
exactly)

Old school hip-hop however, is niceness. The "bling"era rappers can take a 
flying leap for all I care.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: no lollapalooza :(



I guess I am thinking of the more non-commercial hiphop.. I guess you
could almost call it the "alternative" hiphop... Jurassic 5, Blackalicious,
The Streets, Ray and Christian, ect.

Jurassic 5 was apparently one of the most successful acts of the last
lollapalooza.

Yeah, the bling-bling hiphop is certianly akin to hair metal.  

The term "hip-hop" just casts *way* too wide of a net these days...

Subject: [sfraves] taking quotes out of context  (nrr)

i had to comment on this out of context quote:

"8 years of trickle down politics, open borders, failed social
> > programs, focusing on bj's instead of work, and overall bleeding heart
> > liberalism got us in this spot folks; Bush didn't create this, he
> > inherited it."

trickle down politics is a Reaganism.  i did not shed a tear when he died.
the southern border of the u.s. is only open one way.  americans can go to
mexico.  mexicans can't come to the U.S.

i like jack too and although he kids a ton and likes to rile people up, i
think he is alot more conservative than me.  politically that is. 
musically he is much more progressive. ;)

don't worry Jack, there aren't any bleedings hearts in arizona.  it's a
state filled with workers.  in fact everyone there works on Martin Luther
King Day.

I keep all the mail I receive, disk space is cheap. And that only took
me about 15 minutes to assemble, FWIW. But you're right about one thing:
I do need to get a job. :(

Maybe the stuff about women was, but I'm pretty sure the rest of it
wasn't. Regardless, it makes for a pretty fun read.

Are you implying that I'm a "player hater, "holmes"?

Hey guys, let's not turn my last day in the bay into a flame war. Shaun was
just being funny. If you are offended too bad. I have said some of those
things, other's I did not; O-H-W-E-L-L

I take comfort in the fact Shaun gave me that much thought this morning.
Never the less thanks for sticking up for 'ol jackie.

what the deal is there? also, anyone have any good recommendations on
good breaky tech-house? (besides Layo & Bushwhacka?)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: no lollapalooza :(

I have an objection to calling bling-bling ghetto trash. First of all,
real ghetto types draw the line at wearing makeup in front of a
camera. Second, Detroit ghetto-tech is ghetto trash, and it is
goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood.

Bling-bling became the number-one selling genre in 2000, displacing
country for the first time in like thirty years. But there is a
bizarre inexplicable coincidence that makes no sense at all here,
which is that at the same time that this black music owns the
airwaves, if you took a look at black **movies** you'd think the
entire country had gone backwards in time. Soul Plane? How can a movie
like Soul Plane be made at a time when black musicians are making so
much money? Isn't economic power political power?

And why don't black musicians in England make bling-bling, too? Why
are they still churning out jungle and house and garage like everybody
else in England? Can't they see their unique opportunities? Don't they
want to be rich?

I haven't been this confused since I moved to a Chicago ghetto and
found out rap had more listeners in the suburbs of Chicago than it did
in the ghettoes...

I wonder if that's still true today...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] taking quotes out of context  (nrr)

	Although Reagan once used the phrase "trickle down," he didn't 
originate or popularize it. His critics jumped on the language as a way 
to ridicule free market concepts such as the Laffer Curve (see 
http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) that they didn't 
understand (not that Reagan always understood them that well either). 
If anything really deserves to be called "trickle-down economics," it's 
the big government welfare state itself.

	Think about it: Government sucks up a whole bunch of money in taxes, 
then after salaried officials and special interests have taken their 
cut and a certain percentage is simply lost and wasted, the remainder 
"trickles down" to the people via various dignity-destroying and 
conformity-building programs administered by soulless bureaucracies. 
This description fits not only AFDC, Medicare, Social Security and the 
like, but everything from the military to the government schools.

These labels tend to be on the techy-er side:
-Touchin Bass Recordings
-Mechanoise 
-Streetwise

Streetwise owns!!! I have a rack of shit off that label. Mechanoise is on
the darker more "jungley" tip IMO though. Techy, yes - but very subby. Not a
huge fan.

Alot of Koma & Bones newer stuff has a techy feel as well.

actually I meant bkz I'm looking for breaky tech-house and they're the
only tech-house I really know. **but** since you ask I do actually
have a breaks record they made in like 2000 or something...kinda
uninspired tho to tell the truth...

couldn't name the track but yeah, I think I had it on a CD or
something...they've always been great. dig Silencer too altho they're
not quite in the "buy on sight" category for me personally.

How could I forget some of the newer "4xBreak" stuff???

District (which is Meat Katie & Christian J) - they have a couple tracks =
out on KINGSIZE

Meat Katie - The Answer (original & Force mass Motion mixes) - Kingsize =
(really sick acidy tech-house/breaks)

Derrick Carter - Where U At? (Meat Katie & Elite Force mixes) - white =
label (funky chunky style!)

Elite Force - Jack The Joint/Melodik Hypnotik - W9Y (tech-house/breaks)

Hybrid - I'm Still Awake (Christian J/Sud mixes) - Distinctive (the =
Christian J side is a beast!)

Obviously yo can see who in the breaks world is working with =
tech-house/4x4 shit - but it's all really damn good (IMHO). Atomic =
Hooligan does some sjhit that leans more towards a 4x4 beat as well, but =
you have to look around for it (they're on Botchit & Scarper). Aquasky =
is even doing some housier shit these days as well, but often times it's =
either more "electro-house" or just plain ol' funked out house - all =
hard as shit tho.=20

Enjoy!

Maybe it's not so much about race, as it is about class... as in:  some 
people have it, and some don't.

I'm not the biggest fan of ANY of those three genres.  But I've got a 
fuck of a lot more respect for the guys producing that music, than I do 
for the ghetto-trash that you see rapping on MTV and such (And yes, 
that includes white ghetto-trash like m&m.).

	I don't know, I'm not generally a fan of "gangsta rap," but Eminem is 
quite talented imho. His style of rapping really has spawned a lot of 
imitators, and his lyrics are a lot more interesting and intelligent 
than those of the average rapper. I don't like that he still has a lot 
of the ego/tough-guy bullshit typical of the genre, but you have to 
give him credit for putting his fears, vulnerabilities and insecurities 
out there in his music too. And his movie "Eight Mile" is definitely 
worth watching. Some of the MC battle scenes in particular are powerful 
and intense.

Groove on,

Subject: [sfraves] BSP??? an epiphany of sound

I ***THINK*** I'm playing today at 9am on An Epiphany Of Sound at KZSU
90.1FM, broadcasting out of Stanford University and streamable here:

http://kzsulive.stanford.edu/
(channel KZSU-1)

I say "I think" because until about ten minutes ago I was under the
impression that today was Wednesday, not Thursday.

Anyway, tune in, you should be able to hear it. From the home page:

"On a good day, our 500-watt signal reaches from Oakland and parts of
San Francisco in the north, to Fremont and points beyond in the east,
and down to around Gilroy in the south. It's just about the whole Bay
Area -- most of the coverage of commercial stations which broadcast at
50,000 watts and more. KZSU broadcasts in full stereo, and without
much of the compression favored by most Bay Area commercial stations."

Subject: [sfraves] Re: BSP??? an epiphany of sound

PS -- I'll be playing a range of breaks records, from funky to techy,
with a good strong dose of British-Jamaican styles thrown in for good
measure, including that "Hot Stepper" Ini Kmoze bootleg I was drooling
so much about a while back. Depending on how friendly the KZSU CDJs
turn out to be, I might work in a few original tracks, including a
political hip-hop instrumental that samples George Bush, and possibly
some other material as well. Boh! And stuff.

I don't feel one way or another about Eminem's rapping - but he's a 
marketing genius (or has one working for him) - and you really can't argue 
that. He's like the Marylin Manson of hip-hop/rap.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re: BSP??? an epiphany of sound

Man - that Hot Steppa remix (once again) is SOOOOOOOOOOO slow. I played it 
the other day pitched at +8, and it was barely breaking 128 (or so it 
seemed). It took me like 3 or 4 records to get up to a good pace. Glad it 
was given to me - cuz I'd never have paid for it.

Yes, it's really great to have Giles back in town.  The freak quota has
finally notched back up a bit with his return.  Now if we could only
keep that trend happening!

Anyway, as Giles said, TUNE THE FUCK IN!  We'll try to be stupid and
stuff. :)

Sometimes I think I live in bizarroland, where up is down, left is
right, and Bush is in the Whitehouse.

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Fuck the color of your skin. That bears little meaning as to who the trashy
ass folk are out there. Hence - the most common use of trash - *white trash*
=)

Eminem is 100% white trash right up there with Kid Rock. Hell they both take
pride in it!

please, please, please, if anyone can help me out with tickets, hit me back.  I'm willing to pay more than face value, I just want to go!

Here's some info on the CAN SPAM ACT of 2003:

http://www.spamlaws.com/federal/108s877.html


The enrolled (final) text of S. 877 as it was passed by the Senate on 
November 25, 2003, and agreed to by the House of Representatives on 
December 8, 2003, appears below (also available in PDF).  The bill was 
signed by the President on December 16, 2003, and takes effect on January 
1, 2004.

The final text of the bill is very similar to that approved by the House 
of Representatives on November 22, 2003 (available here), with relatively 
minor technical corrections. The version of the bill that was approved by 
the Senate on October 22, 2003, is available here, and the original text 
of the bill as it was introduced on April 10, 2003, is here.

In a Nutshell, ...

"...Can Spam Act of 2003
>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, signed into law by President Bush on December 
16, 2003, establishes the first national standards for the sending of 
commercial e-mail and requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to 
enforce its provisions. The bill's full name is an acronym: Controlling 
the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003.

It also requires the FTC to promulgate rules to shield consumers from 
unwanted mobile service commercial messages.

The bill permits e-mail marketers to send unsolicited commercial e-mail as 
long as it contains all of the following:

     * an opt-out mechanism;
     * a functioning return e-mail address;
     * a valid subject line indicating it is an advertisement; and
     * the legitimate physical address of the mailer.

The legislation also prohibits the sale or other transfer of an e-mail 
address obtained through an opt-out request. It criminalizes the use of 
automated means to register for multiple e-mail accounts from which to 
send spam. It prohibits sending sexually-oriented spam without clear 
markings.

It pre-empts existing state anti-spam laws, and makes it a misdemeanor to 
send spam with falsified header information. It sets out civil penalties 
for a host of other common spamming practices used to obtain e-mail 
addresses, including harvesting, dictionary attacks, Internet protocol 
spoofing, hijacking computers through Trojan horses or worms, or using 
open mail relays for the purpose of sending spam..."

Troy,

	First of all, Eminem isn't always talking about bling-bling the way a  
lot of rappers are. His name came up not in connection with that, but  
with the "ghetto-trash" label -- which I thought would have provided a  
lot more fuel to anyone wanting to make a prejudice issue out of any of  
this, but anyway...

	Second, there's a whole long list of black hip hop artists whose music  
and talent I appreciate: Public Enemy, Too Short, Grandmaster Flash,  
RUN-DMC, Dr. Dre, Ice T, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, Queen Latifah, Will  
Smith, Eric B & Rakim, Notorious BIG, De La Soul, Conscious Daughters,  
etc. But we weren't talking about them.

	If someone had been dissing Eminem for being materialist while  
praising lots of black rappers pushing the same image, and you had  
reason to believe most of the folks on this list were black, I doubt  
you would have said something like "Ya'll a bunch of black boys on this  
list, dissin' white bling bling but praising black bling bling. Yeah,  
it's all cool, as long as it's a nigga making the cash."

	No, I don't think you would've have said that. But you probably think  
it's OK to say what you said, because accusing white people of racism  
is more politically correct. There's more social protection for making  
that accusation. And apparently you'd rather jump to slanderous  
conclusions than ask more and find out.

Tired of such nonsense,

Yes, people, come on now. Less making with the funny, more serious
respect for real hip-hop artists like Slim Shady and the Fresh Prince
of Bel Air.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP??? an epiphany of sound

God that was fun! Not particularly skilled on my part, but fun all the same.

Actually...self-indulgent DJ self-analysis begins here...recommend
skipping if easily bored:

Long time ago a DJ friend told me I was DJing wrong, said I needed to
get the mix right in the headphones and then bring it in with the
faders, instead of doing what I do normally, which is just play by ear
the whole time (literally), throwing a record ahead or pulling it back
whenever the hell I feel like it. Every single trainwreck I did today,
and there were a lot, came about when I followed that guy's advice,
whoever he was. (It's been a long time, I forgot who it was, all I
remember is he got more gigs than I did so I figured he knew what he
was talking abt. And actually he probably did, but true for him and
true for me are different kinds of true.)

Anyway. Self-indulgent yadda yadda over! JC thanks a ton, apologies
for getting there late but I hadn't been to the radio station in abt 5
years and I've never gotten out of bed that early in my life before!
In fact I just woke up from a nap.

Oh come on man. You can say whatever you want about them, I don't give
a fuck, but I'm not paying homage to Will Smith or Marshall Mathers in
a list devoted to music. If we were talking about actors with great
comic timing, that might be another story, but you respect your
favorite rappers and I'll respect mine.

tat...tat....tat...tat...tat.  Ah, john, Eminem is not from the "ghetto," 
although he has carefully constructed this marketable image.  I know your 
thinking well enough, I hope, to assume you don't equate ghetto with 
trash.  I'm not sure what you mean by "class."

Back to the hip hop context.  Perhaps we should make a distinction between 
what I see as pop hop and genuine hip hop.

Hip hop's origins go back to the seventies and the genre grew up right 
along with disco, punk, glam rock and, later, house.  One really can't 
equate the likes of Eminem, 50 Cent, and Nelly (MTV pop hop) with hip hop 
greats like Public Enemy, the Sugerhill Gang, Africa Bambaataa, Grand 
Master Flash, and A Tribe Called Quest to name a few.  What differentiates 
pop hop from hip hop?

Pop hop is the child of corporate marketing and "targeted" music 
programming.  This stuff arose in the nineties.   I would think that those 
of you who worship our economic system and resultant philosophy of life 
would be avid pop hop fans:)  From what I can gather from pop hop lyrics, 
the meaning of life, the good life, is:  making lots of money;  buying an 
acceptable ride;  dressing in flash clothes and esoteric shoes;  and doing 
whatever needs to be done to assure this lifestyle.  That's really the 
consensus reality of America right now for many, is it not?  The drug 
dealer is the quintessential entrepreneur -- no ethics, no compassion, a 
Darwinian money-making machine.  Then there is the sex.  Since the market 
for pop music is teenagers one layers on steamy sexuality, with a 
misogynistic, often homophobic cast that is especially appealing to teenage 
males.  Pop hop artists sell clothing lines, accessories, and must have 
footwear.  Big bucks.  Sharp marketing.

Music that arises from marketing research and corporate manipulation, 
however, becomes stale rather quickly.  Thus, the growing boredom with much 
popular music beyond pop hop and the decline of events like 
Lollapalooza.  The decline in CD sales has little to do with downloading, 
IMO.  People are tired of paying for programmed mediocrity.  One of the 
bright spots in CD and music sales, I understand, is sixties rock purchased 
by those in their early teens.

Hip hop, on the other hand, was and is not a carefully crafted marketing 
device.  Much early hip hop was politically radical and arose from the 
frustrations of an oppressed minority.  It had, and still has, the edgy 
feel of authentic punk and early rock.  For every Eminem there are hundreds 
of "underground" hip hop artists of high quality making and distributing 
music outside the system -- some literally on street corners.  There is a 
vibrant hip hop community in the Bay Area that bears no resemblance 
whatsoever to the materialistic, corporate pop hop scene.

Love,

Apollo

Your License, Your Urine




By Paul Armentano, AlterNet
Posted on June 21, 2004, Printed on June 24, 2004
http://www.alternet.org/story/19008/

Imagine if it were against the law to drive home after consuming a single 
glass of wine at dinner. Now imagine it is illegal to drive after having 
consumed a single glass of wine two weeks ago. Guess what? If you smoke 
pot, it's time to stop imagining.

Legislation weaving its way through the US Congress demands all 50 states 
pass laws granting police the power to drug test drivers and arrest anyone 
found to have "any detectable amount of a controlled substance ... present 
in the person's body, as measured in the person's blood, urine, saliva, or 
other bodily substance." Though the expressed purpose of the law is to 
target and remove drug-impaired drivers from US roadways, the proposal 
would do nothing of the sort.

Good thing I can't drive anywhere, lol.

"Lose Yourself"
by Eminem

Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?  Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's chokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life, and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

	The United States Senate voted this week to increase the penalties for  
violations by television and radio broadcasters of the prohibitions  
against transmission of "obscene," "indecent," and "profane" language.  
The bill raises the amount of fines that can be imposed not just  
against companies but against individual DJs as well up to $3 million  
per offense.

	The sole member of the Senate to vote against this disgusting attack  
on free speech was John Breaux, a conservative Democrat from Louisiana.  
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who has missed 90% of his votes  
this year in the Senate, decided not to miss this one and voted for it.  
CSPAN has the record of the vote here:

Sometimes I think I live in bizarroland, where up is down, left is
right, and Bush is in the Whitehouse.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Not by a long shot.  By "class", I mean something more nebulous than 
someone's net worth.  I know poor people who live in "the getto" who 
have far more class than many rich people.  To me, "class" is something 
more about how you conduct yourself, self-respect, and respect for 
others.  Suffice it to say, the glorification of violence, the 
misogyny, the homophobia, and a long list of other issues endemic to 
today's rap, demonstrate a total lack of "class", IMO.

Don't forget Run DMC, Biz Markie, and of course, the Beastie Boys.  
It's not that I hate ALL rap...  just what it's become today.

Come to think of it, everyone on your list, and my own additions, got 
their start in the '80s.  And I actually DO like a LOT of '80s rap.  
But there seems to be a period, somewhere in the early to mid '90s when 
rap changed.  It was no longer a good time and good music.  It was no 
longer about fighting for your right to party, busting a move, walking 
this way, and how parents just don't understand.  It was no longer 
happy and fun.

Somewhere, in those early to mid '90s, it became about who's the 
baddest MF-er, popping caps in asses, doing all the chronic you can, 
smacking the bitches and hoes, living in a gangster's paradise, and so 
on.  Not too long after, rap began to look like a bad parody of 1920's 
mafioso...  Stupid, contemptible, hateful lyrics became stupid, 
contemptible, hateful behavior.  You've got east-coast rappers shooting 
at west-coast rappers, and vice versa, rap labels being run out of 
prison cells, rap "artists" running around with big "posses" of thugs 
to beat people up FOR them, and ghetto-trash showing at rap shows with 
guns (And, oh yeah, carrying a gun in public makes them trash, 100%, no 
exceptions.), shooting at each other, and screwing things up for 
EVERYONE, even those of us who, otherwise, wouldn't give 2 shits about 
the rap scene.  (Witness the closure of that Campbell venue, and the 
cancellation of that dance-music thing at Great America a while back, 
for examples.)

For a good example of which rap groups have class, and which don't:  
Remember the Tibetan Freedom Festivals?  A project of The Beastie Boys, 
they were.  Can you imagine m&m, sugar knight, the notorious big, snoop 
doggy dog, 50 cent, or any of their ilk putting something like that 
together not for their personal gain, but to help the denizens of an 
oppressed nation that most Americans probably can't find on a map?  I 
sure can't.

Sure, put Grand Master Flash on stage with the Sugarhill Gang and 
Africa Bambaataa, follow it up with Run DMC and the Beasties, and I'll 
happily go, and scrounge my bottom dollar for the privilege.

Fill a stage with the trash that constitutes post-mid-'90s rappers?  
Not a chance.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Kerry votes to increase penalties for "obscene" speech on TV and radio

	No, I certainly would not imply that. I expect Bush will probably 
support the higher penalties on free speech. Any president who would 
keep Ashcroft as Attorney General can't care about it much. And I 
wouldn't be surprised if Kerry thinks the Bush plan to screen all U.S. 
residents for mental illness that I posted about on Tuesday is a good 
idea too. Democrats tend to like universal government health care 
measures. Birds of a feather, statists both.

little more fiscally current along with actually
holding the person saying such words or showing such
images responsible. OH THE HORROR!!!

i didn't see anything in there (thow, i don reed sew
goud, sew i kooda mist it) that changed the policies
of anything. i'm pretty sure "free speech" and "free
language" are two diffent things. if you can't get yer
point across without offending someone (based on
choice of words, rather than view), yer probably
speaking the wrong language. try french, then no one
will care what you say so you can say anything you
want anyway.

and it's not 3 million an offense, at the most it's
$500,000 per offense. i doth qoute: "the amount of
forfeiture penalty shall not exceed $275,000 for the
first violation, $375,000 for the second, and $500,000
for the third and any subsequent violation, with a
24-hour period limit of $3 million." that's 6
violations in 24 hours. oh and it: "Requires the FCC,
when determining a penalty, to consider the violator's
ability to pay."

i'm pretty sure that college radio dj's won't be
gettin jacked for 3 mil. although, if yer at stanford,
hmmmmm.

damn the french are dumb. and i get to say that since
i'm part french. i hate me.............d'j...

the FCC recently levied its highest obscenity fee ever against Howard
Stern and a number of stations broadcasting him. this stuff used to be
the reason you couldn't hear rap on the radio.

At least you can now play things that say Fuck on the air (as long as
it's not in a sexual context, which is REALLY what the regs. are all

Yes, 1015 is trying to transform. And we'll be helping. Beginning this
Friday, FREEFORM will be hosting the upstairs VIP room one Friday a
month. They're wanting to work their magic and play their part in
transforming 1015 back into a kick-ass club! As such, this Friday will
feature Iyad, Floorcraft and J.C., as well as YOU! And in the main room
it's none other than Max Graham (http://www.spundae.com/fls/sf4.html).

It's only with YOUR help that we can see 1015 return to it's days of
old! Join us Friday as we begin that journey!

There is a way for you to get on the guestlist to receive half price
admission (only $10) by emailing either floorcraft@progressiveflow.com
or iyad@progressiveflow.com no later than Friday at 4pm. The half off
price is good until 12 midnight. ALSO, it is FREE to get in B4 10:30, so
if you arrive early enough, you won't have to pay!

Hope to see lots of you there!

everyone knows that spundae is no longer hosting fridays at 1015, right?

also, on july 9th, it's drum and bass in the mainroom of 1015, breaks 
upstairs.  it's extremely rare to see dnb in 1015 anymore.

will be interesting to see how things change.  ah, the memories of old...

Subject: [sfraves] turntable help. please?

ok, so i've been noticing that my mixes at home have been majorly sucking at 
times, so i decided to blame it all on my turntables.  however, upon close 
inspection, i believe the problem IS my tables!

one of my 1210mk2s, when the pitch is set close to zero, tends to nudge 
itself forward in small, random intervals.  i noticed because i stared at 
the red LED and watched the little dots move by themselves.

anyhow, does this mean my tables need tuning?  could fluctuations in my 
electrical current be a cause (our wiring in our place is old and shotty).  
any other suggestions?

how do you feel about Final Scratch and the whole cdj/mp3j phenomenon? 
bad for vinyl diggers/collectors/producers or great for not having to lug around records and wear out a gem? 
great for more people to play out their music or destroying the dj rep? 
 
any feedback would be great. email me back, full name and city if you dont mind but not necesary.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] turntable help. please?

I have a deck that does this occasionally.  Its about 20 years old and
I'm too lazy to get it fixed so when it starts acting the fool I just
spray some lube in there.  I don't have the stuff in front of me.. but
there are a number of products designed to lubricate electrical parts
like the pitch control.  I'm sure someone on here knows the best kind to
get.  When its all lubed up it works just fine...

I've never heard of an SL12xx turntable with pitch creep. Hmmm..
Maybe the pitch slider hardware has gone foo?

I'd hit up Don Spence and ask his advice. He's local and has
a good rep for doing repairs/mods on 1200s.

The visceral hands-on interface to digital music is going to
get a lot better. The "works like a turntable" top of the line
digital players are getting close to turntable ability. At
some point, they're going to surpass and eventually blow away
turntables for their ability to manipulate sound, their ease
of use, and other features that will allow DJs to be that much
more effective.

As this happens, more and more people are going to see a lot of
advantages over vinyl, and will start using more digital formats.

Beatmatching is going to get nearly automatic. Interfaces will
improve, and allow one to dig into a huge music library with
ease. Software is going to show you a pretty track layout while
it's playing. Mixes will get a lot more creative as anticipating
that killer drop 32 measures ahead will be cake.

(Hey, anyone wanna fund me to design the killer interface??? :))

I don't think the DJ rep is going to be destroyed. Oh, yeah,
there will be a lot more "DJs", that's for sure. We'll be as
saturated with bad DJs as we currently are with bad tracks.

DJing has almost nothing to do with technical skills though,
and everything about the very black art of working a groove and a
crowd at the same time. Almost any dufus can learn to beatmatch,
but reliably making a crowd dance and scream is still something
not that many, even here in the bay area, can do.

The future...

What if a track was released in a multi-track common format that
was very amenable to remixing and other tweaking? What if you
wanted to mix in, but precisely kill the new drums and haul over
just *then*? What if a remixing console gave you the ability
to do this on the fly? What if there were several alternate
drumlines you could use? What if this was REALLY easy to use?

I think there will always be room to expand one's skills and
ability to manipulate a groove. At some point, anyone will be
able to beatmatch (I bet tracks will be released with beat
markers to make this perfect). But the people with serious
skill and creativity are going to have tools to do awesome
one-of-a-kind performances. They're going to be manipulating
tracks and your ass and good DJing will still be the art it
always was.

And there will still be vinyl :). But digital is going to be
a big wonderful world of sound and manipulation to play in.

Sean

Subject: Re: [sfraves] turntable help. please?


Probably a dirty pitch slider.

No, it's not power fluctuations.  I've run decks off of really bad power,
the sound system is browning out, the lights will stop working, but
the mix still sticks.

Hit the slider with the Caig stuff.

If it's near your 0 point, it's likely that you're drifting between the
pitch being locked and not locked (looking at the platter dots, is it
going from perfectly motionless to a slight drift?).  Basic zero adjust
(the easiest service to do on 1200s, you can do it yourself) should help
or fix it altogether.  Also, get in the habit of leaving your tables at 0
lock when not playing them.  That way, any wear at the point the slider is
left at is at a point where it's not being used.

Those things are surprisingly durable.  Mine have been to at least a 100
parties/outdoors/clubs/houseparties and never have required service.  I've
pitched them up and down again (although ALWAYS TURN OFF THE DECK WHEN YOU
TAKE OFF THE PLATTER... you can kill a 1200 that way), and they feel
better than when I brought them home new.

vinyl, whoooo!

	Actually the RAVE Act legislation you speak of came from Senator 
Joseph Biden of Delaware, a Democrat. Perhaps instead of just bashing 
Bush and his supporters, as it's so easy to do living in the Bay Area 
where most people are leftist, you should check your apparent premise 
that Bush and the Republicans are so much worse than the other 
establishment party. Look at San Francisco. Basically a one-party town 
controlled by Democrats. Is the city government friendly to ravers and 
electronic dance culture? Hell no! Shouldn't that tell you something?

Groove on,

I would say it's pretty friendly. There are lots of clubs and other venues
(Cell Space, SomARTS), not to mention street EDM themed festivals like
Howard Street Fair and now the Love Parade in the fall.

Only if you compare it to the Libertarian ideal of zero government
intervention could you call SF government unfriendly to dance culture.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: A Democrat introduced the anti-rave RAVE act (was: [sfraves] poof! nrr)

Well i have passed Biden and Hatch and several others during gigs I
get on the Hill, (i'm the guy with the glitter on my face walking the
Halls of Congress, they can't arrest me for *that,* and it's fun to
watch these people, duly elected 'representatives,' and lobbysists
squirm when we share an elevator together), and my wife is a total
C-Span junkie, and we attended the ROAR protest last September on the
Senate side of the Capitol that one massachusetts dj tried to
sabotage, so yes, I do know who these people are, and yes, i know that
Biden's a Democrat, and that's just splitting hairs as far as i'm
concerned., and to keep trotting that chestnut out  loses sight of the
bigger picture which is....

These people DON'T LIKE US and want to legislate us out of existence.

They are well on the way to doing so, and it makes no difference what
their party affiliation is

Last year at Starscape in Baltimore, where Dieselboy played at our
wedding, partygoers commented on how chill the cops were being, and i
was like, of course they are, they got that shite in their back
pocket, now, and they know it, so why get all aggro?

Now, the only way the RAVE act can be repealed, since it's on the
books, which is why last year's ROAR protest was so *pointless,* is
that somebody has to get ARRESTED and then take it all the way up to
the US Supreme Court.

Who wants to go first?

It'll be 20 years before this law goes away, unless America undergoes
a pretty radical shift, starting like, right now, and it needs to run
significantly deeper than just putting bush out of office, or going to
see Michael Moore's latest.

Funny thing is, this law could easily be applied to the NFL, major
League baseball, etc, etc, but you didn't hear George invoke its use
in this year's State of the Union Address to combat steroid use, now
did you?

That's because they want to keep the populace drugged up on their
bread and circuses.

They're so messed up, the lot of them, I didn't see a one of them,
(save biden, actually, as much as I hate the man i give him props for
talking ashcroft down, though that got missed by the reagan funeral,
nice how they used that to take the spotlight offa them for a whole
ten days, i swear these fux eat their own, never mind that the amount
of mentally ill people reagan killed is on par with how many jews got
murdered in germany), express the kind of apoplectic rage Michael
Powell did over Janet jackson's bare breast. as the prison photos....

ok this got too long, i'm out.

So what are you saying vote for bush? No political party is going to

1. Democrats vs Republicans:

I used to think they were equally bad. Then Bush got elected.

I mean come on. Schwarzenegger believes we're not killing puppies fast
enough. Republicans are EVIL.

That being said, it'd be kinda cool, in a sick and wrong way, if Bush
won the election legitimately this time, instead of stealing it like
he did last time, AND that happened because Nader ran and got a ton of
votes AGAIN. These guys lost the election because they weren't liberal
enough. Then they run another neo-conservative? What are they fucking
stupid?

2. Gay marriage:

I realize nobody actually brought it up, but we were on politics, so:
I believe the gay marriage issue is really a separation of church and
state issue. When all those anti-gay-marriage oafs go on TV spouting
this and that, the term "sanctity" is inevitably raised, by them.
Sanctity is a matter of religion, not of government. If those people
are telling the truth, and the issue for them is the sanctity of
marriage, then obviously it means that the issue is a religious issue,
and government has no place in the matter at all. If your religion or
set of spiritual beliefs sanctifies same-sex unions, then they have
sanctity; and if not, then you must simply agree to live and let live.
Since the separation of church and state is one of the founding
principles of this country, laws protecting the alleged sanctity of
specific types of marriage are probably unconstitutional and certainly
anti-American.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A Democrat introduced the anti-rave RAVE act (was: [sfraves] poof! nrr)

OK, I have to throw in on this one- to me it's not so much about
people's true intents, it's about what their party dictates that they
do.  Bush is a Republican.  The GOP is based upon a policy of sticking
to old traditions, lowered spending on social services, a
not-in-my-backyard attitude, and looking with a suspicious eye upon
youth culture.  The Democrats, liberal though they may not be at
current, are bound to a policy of tolerance, celebration of diversity,
and a more "youthful" attitude.

That doesn't mean a hip young rep couldn't come along and change all
that, or that the neo-con dems currently skulking around aren't fast
eroding what one thinks of when the term "liberal" comes to mind.

However, at the end of the day, if Bush says, "We are going to drill
for oil in Alaska and push for more clearcutting in the northwest",
nobody is surprised.  This is classic conservative policy- take what
America needs to sustain its lifestyle and worry about the
political/environmental repercussions later.  

If Kerry gets into office and immediately says, "I want to loosen
regulations on greenhouse gases and cut prisoner-for-oil deals with
hostile nations", his consituents, nay, his entire party, would jump to
counter him.  That's just "not how Democrats act", right?

So even ignoring individual actions, there is a certain amount of
security in the party of one's choice.  Tenuous though it may seem,
there's a tangible link between the graven-in-stone philosophies of
each party, and the course of action the leaders who identify with them
must take.

Can you imagine the shitstorm if Bush were to free a bunch of drug
offenders in his lame-duck period, or help to vote in a piece of
pro-abortion legislature?  He'd be absolutely toast- much the same way
a liberal candidate would be if they chose to continue on in the
current path, business as usual once they took office.

In choosing between two dishonest, dubiously-qualified people to head
my country, I'll choose the one backed by the left every time.  It's a
sad choice, but a neccesary one.

..and jesus christ, Nader..  A lesson is a lesson but if you help Bush
into office again..  Ooh boy.  A pair of pliers and a blowtorch are too
good for you. ;)

(just kidding)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A Democrat introduced the anti-rave RAVE act (was: [sfraves] poof! nrr)

	There's a political expression that says "Only Nixon can go to China." 
It means that only someone who is trusted by opponents of something has 
the political ability to get away with doing that very thing. For 
example, look at how government spending has gone up faster under Bush 
than it did under Clinton. Look how Bush has proposed spending billions 
of dollars for things like fighting AIDS in Africa. If a Democrat had 
done these things, Republicans would be raising a shitstorm, but 
because it's happened under "one of their own," they let Bush get away 
with it.

	Similarly Bush would be more likely to be criticized for the actions 
you mention below than Kerry, because the opponents of those 
environmental policies already hate Bush. If Kerry were to do something 
like propose more clearcutting, many leftists would give him a pass 
because they wouldn't want to undermine what they considered a 
"friendly" administration. He would find a clever way of justifying it 
to them, and they'd want to believe his explanation.

	Because leaders of both establishment parties put power and political 
expediency over principle, you can't really count on Kerry to act like 
an honest liberal once in office any more than Republicans have been 
able to count on Bush behaving like an honest conservative.

	If you're a leftist, you ought to vote for the Green Party candidate 
(who will probably be David Cobb). Forget Nader, he's running as an 
independent -- building the Green Party will better advance left-wing 
interests in the long term. If you're a conservative, vote for Michael 
Peroutka of the Constitution Party. He's much more of a real 
conservative than Bush. And if you want social tolerance and less 
government, vote for Libertarian Michael Badnarik.

Peace, love & liberty,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A Democrat introduced the anti-rave RAVE act (was: [sfraves] poof! nrr)

	For those who've said in the past that I promote the Libertarian Party 
too much, well, this is Exhibit A of why it's necessary. Many people 
are so fixed on thinking of Bush and Kerry as their only choices that 
even after everything I've posted, all it takes is one message 
criticizing a Democrat for me to be mistaken for a Bush supporter! For 
the record, yes I think Bush deserves a second term -- but this one in 
jail instead of the White House. Preferably with Bill Clinton as his 
cellmate.

	My recommendation is vote Libertarian -- Michael Badnarik for 
President (http://www.badnarik.org). Michael expects to be on the 
ballot in at least 48 states, more than Ralph Nader or any other 
candidate except Bush and Kerry. Hopefully he'll be on in all 50 if the 
party wins our lawsuits against the fucked-up ballot access laws they 
have in Oklahoma and Ohio which make it difficult for people to vote 
for alternative candidates in those states. Please sign the petitions 
at http://www.e-thepeople.org/petition/11367/view and 
http://www.opendebates.net/yourrole/petition/ to allow other candidates 
besides Bush and Kerry into the presidential debates.

	We shouldn't resign ourselves to the fact of no political party 
supporting rave culture. The LP may not be explicitly pro-rave so much 
as rave-neutral, but the difference between us and other parties is 
that Libertarians are not going to go after and try to shut down 
peaceful people doing their own thing, whether it's music, sex, drugs, 
or whatever. It's none of the government's damn business. Michael 
Badnarik as president would stand up for people who are getting busted, 
censored, and otherwise screwed, and try to put an end to such actions 
by the authorities. Bush and Kerry on the other hand will aid and abet 
the people trying to screw us.

Peace, love & liberty,

hello, this is a reality break from your favorite read:
 
pizza parlor: why do you buy cheese in bulk and then think that we want to eat the bulk before it goes bad? what is wrong with making a good pizza with normal amounts of cheese so that we love your pizza inside and out? please, ease up on the cheese, oh, pizza parlor with the great pizza deals. :)

doh

hit the 'send' button by accident!

one this he said at one of his campaign rallies really stuck out in my 
mind -  something about having openness, trust, and love as guiding 
values in the US.

when have you EVER heard a politician talk about LOVE as a value to 
strive for?

I on the other hand have run turntables on crapy power (40hz) and had
excatly the same problem.  We fixed the genny and the turntable went

Robert Kennedy when he was running for President.  Heard one of his 
speeches the other day and I was amazed at the difference between political 
values and ideals then, and now.  Bobby, of course, was shot and killed...

Subject: [sfraves] On Hip Hip/Bling


I know why some of you hate hip hop.  You're jealous (as Vlad would say,
"ya playa hatin")!

Well, you can have the look without smoking up all your cashish:
http://www.icedoutgear.com/CB55.php

Jokes aside, you might not like it, but some of the production you hear
from Neptunes, Premier, Timbaland, Dan the Automator, Numark, Peanut
Butter Wolf, DJ Shadow or Outkast is sick as fuck.  Sorry, but there's
creativity there you don't hear in what we gather round (being breaks,
house, techno, etc).  A lot of the fans just like to sum it up as a
difference between hip hop and rap.  Tell you the truth, I would never be
caught dead at an Eminem show (music might even be ok, but I sure as fuck
don't want to put up with the assholes in the crowd who rally behind a guy
who talks about his mom like that *oh the pain of growing up white and
misundestood*)... but one of my best times musically lately was an outdoor
free show with Del at the Berekely campus... or when I dropped some
Handsome Boy Modeling School during soundcheck at a party and someone
there hands me a phone and puts me on with Dan the Automator (who produced
the record along with Prince Paul).

Underground hip hop is accessible, human and feeling... more about a
message and not about talking shit, wearing stupid jewelry and all that
crap you see on MTV.  Same goes on the DJ aspect, having met Qbert, Yoga
Frog, Radar...  they're all mellow individuals who are successful on their
own terms, not busting their balls trying to prove it to someone else.

Hip hop definitely has some stupid rap stars in it (who tend to have the
videos, the press, and often a lion's share of the money), but throwing
out the baby with the bathwater shorts you a *lot* of great music and I
know I don't listen to music that's locked in at a hectic 140 bpm 24/7.

Try out some J5, Living Legends, De La Soul.. and know better.
andyw

p.s. In related news, I went to the warehouse of the label that put out
the first Invisbl Skratch Piklz album last night... saw some weird french
musique concrete done in ridiculous surround sound, heard some deep
hypnotic drone ambient, and of course, a member of Matmos spanking the
other member's bare ass with one hand and holding a mic with the other as
a form of percussion.  San Francisco is a damn weird town, but it's my
damn weird town.

Good to know!  We used to get such crappy power out of Gabber Dave's old
Coleman genny that you'd get a free light show (the blacklights would all
go on and off at the weirdest times from the flouro ballast going in and
out of phase with the power).  Hrm, maybe that's why I'd trainwreck at
those beach parties.... heheheheh.  But I never did notice a problem like
what he's describing from power, especially if it's specific to a part of
the slider range/just one turntable, etc.

Subject: Re: Re: [sfraves] A Democrat introduced the anti-rave RAVE act (was: [sfraves] poof! nrr)

just for the record, I'm seriously considering voting "third-party"
(ie any party other than Dem/Rep) this election, like I did last time
(Nader). my x-gf voted for Gore and told me I had wasted my vote. but
her candidate WON, and he still didn't get into office. so who really
wasted their vote? Nader's 2000 candidacy will definitely be
remembered by the Dems, and might even erode the two-party system.

but it probably won't. like I said, I thought the Ds and the Rs were
the same, then Bush got into power, and I woke the fuck up. anyway...

ICEDOUTGEAR.COM rocks my ass! I would so sport that shit if people wouldn't
be dumb enough to take it literally....lol.

But I agree with Mr.W - there's a ton of good hip-hop and solid fucking
production coming out of the hip-hop community. Of course, I seperate the
hip-hop community from the MTV rap clique. (the only exceptions being the
Neptunes, Timbaland, Missy and a few others). It's really not the same
overall....

that's not all they did! they cut a deal with the terrorists holding
Americans hostage so that the Americans wouldn't be released until
Reagan got into office. makes me seriously fucking suspicious about
those poor fuckers getting their heads chopped off in Iraq.

Doesn't matter what the popular vote is anyway - the electoral votes are
what counts. Still - the main focus really ought to be about getting Bush
out 1st - then maybe we can get someone who actually works into the white
house.

It should make you suspicious - having hostages killed drums up sentiment
amidst thje "Armchair Generals" of this country.

"Bomb them subhuman brown skinned folks" and all that. It's savage for then
to behead people - but somehow we're right and just when it comes to blowing
the piss out on tons of Iraqi civilians over oil.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015 was soooo much fun lastnight =) Oooh My Goodness man... LoL

this was a fun night, and the VIP room was definitely the highlight in
terms of crowd enthusiasm and such. I dunno abt the "asiasf" thing --
there already is a club by that name, but it's true enough that if you
have issues about dancing in a room full of beautiful young Asian
women then visiting 1015 could be fraught with peril for you.

JC gave me the usual DJ bs abt "I'm unprepared, I dunno what to spin,
I've never heard these records in my life before, hey who are you
anyway?" -- all the things DJs say before they go on. or at least all
the things they say to me. despite all that he did indeed hold it
down, the floor was packed when I left at 4am. (rave geezers like me
need to get to sleep earlier than the resta y'all.)

niceness. and hello Osby...sorry if I didn't see you...been AWOL for
the past three years, hunting bears and travelling to Vladivostok and
such...

The Phoenix Festival 2004
www.phoenixfest.com

July 1st to July 5th
The Phoenix Farm -- Trout Lake, Washington
www.phoenixfest.com/images/adams1.gif

Ticket info: www.phoenixfest.com/tickets.html

In the re:evolutionary spirit of festivals such as Burning Man, Tribal Gath=
ering, Woodstock 1 & Earthdance, PHOENIX FESTIVAL is an annual autonomous m=
usic and arts festival which takes place over the Fourth of July
weekend in the scenic Pacific Northwest.

Featuring simultaneous performances on multiple stages by regional, nationa=
l and internationally recognized performers, Phoenix Festival provides a sa=
fe
and fun environment for thousands of participants to freely express themsel=
ves through the creation of theme camps, participatory workshops, special e=
vents, performance art, and a stunning variety of audio,
video, visual & interactive art installations.

Be sure to check out the webpage (www.phoenixfest.com) to get the full skin=
ny on art projects, theme camps, the marketplace, volunteer
opportunities and other community based events.

This year we have chosen to experiment a bit with the musical format. We've=
 dropped the main stage, opting instead to hand the reigns over to the comm=
unity and foster a totally autonomous environment. You will see
that these folks really took the ball and ran with it.

Below you will find the lineups for all of the stages, each broken up into =
their respective themes.

Ahh, I missed the part about the pitch range dependence.  That does
sound like a slider
problem.  Worse case you can buy a new pitch slider from 1200s.com for
$35.   If you're not
up to doing to service on your own, as mentioned, www.deckmonkey.com
can replace for
you.

     Who won the wars? Evil liberators, did we save more than we lost? Who's 
keeping score? What's it good for when you calculate the cost? For every three 
soldiers sent to war only two come back that went, the government says 2 out 
of 3 ain't bad that's still .666 percent. We can kill a weaker enemy but we 
can't transform their base, our prediction of their strategies insinuates we'd 
do the same if in their place. We ban foreign weapons shamelessly while we keep 
inventing more, even Einstein said you cannot simultaneously prevent and 
prepare for war.   Bombs away at bullies, while we document it history, the war 
with terror metaphor, is still an utter mystery, scratch another nation off our 
never ending list to free, while we slither in circles and swallow our tail in 
idiosynchronicity...

well Erik i do not under stand your question. But i do know if you go to www.1200s.com to look for parts & Vinyl your not going to have the best of luck. i would try hard to find records out. its a UK based website but there site is rocking hard. they are the makes in London of the Mag called Mix Mag if you never heard of it befor i think looking at http://www.htfr.com/ (gosh i love that site & mag its just full of good news and sweet records.) 
 
well if you get back to me on your question i might be of some help.

Huh?  Did I ask a question?  I certainly didn't use a question mark. 
Is this some sort of funny parody that I'm not getting?

Subject: [sfraves] My latest track (collaboration) Goa/Psy Trance

Hey people,

since some of you sent me personal emails about my
previous track I thought I was going to send out a
little message to announce the latest one. It's a
collaboration with Fiery Dawn from Russia, the style
is Goa/Psy, as usual I'll be very happy of any
feedback (good or bad) that you send me.
Follow the link and select mp3 on the displayed

Peace,

-------------------------------1088444606
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I had a great time at 1999 (and also the after party nearby, "2000"). I got  
there a little after 7 and was therefore able to enjoy almost the whole event. 
 Telene opened, and it was great to see her since she hasn't been at very 
many  parties recently. All the DJs seemed to be having a great time, especially  
Denise. There were soooo many classic songs played. Of course!  Denise said  
something about having all kinds of cool obscure songs from the 1999 era that  
she could play, but this was a party for the big, best remembered songs. We 
got  to hear songs like "Save the Rave," and yes, they did play "Imagine," but 
with a  bunch of people including Duckeee on the stage, the finale seemed more 
like a  tribute to the Unity parties of days past, than an attempt to co-opt 
their good  will. 
 
It was great to see a lot of people who hadn't partied in a long  time!
 
This is just a quick mini-review, hoping to hear from some other people.  
I'll have pictures posted on Deciblast but i don't know if it'll be tonight or  
tomorrow.

Subject: [sfraves] Other world Review!!

ok so it has been FOREVER since I have been out and even longer since I have 
done  party review.
But I have slack time at my new job so I figured I would lay it out for ya..

The sound Top notch Gateway with there Mccauley Speakers were hitting just 
right not to loud or low. Well maybe a bit on the loud side since I did not 
have earplugs with me.
Decor.. Minimal yet effective the 4 screens with the visuales was pretty 
cool at several points they were synched to the live PA the guy on the 
screen would say the sample that was being played live, unless it was an 
actual voice feed via the visuals over the live PA? either way neat effect.
Full on fountain in the chill area very nice ambience to the room. No fancy 
intelligent lighting or anything like that but somehow they made it work.

Now to the music, I was a bit skeptical about the live PA thing at a party I 
didn't know it would go over and all but for the most part it worked out 
pretty cool. Some minor complaints. I think the group Cat 5 should have been 
put on at a later time. I give them the utmost props for being able to 
create music and being versatile. But there sound was not right for the time 
slot they played let alone it was not even dance floor friendly. Who wants 
to hear downtempo in the main room at like 12am. I sure don't. It was more 
like a "Jam session" which I felt detracted from the "vibe" of a party and 
it showed people were just milling around and talking it was more like a 
social gathering then a party.  Next complaint. The guy near the end playing 
Live Happy hardcore,breakscore or noise core.. Whatever it was parts were ok 
but then he would go on this expermental tangent that just killed it. Once 
again back to the "Jam session" type of sound at party goer's expense..

Highlights though. Freaky chakra and Single cell orchestra can We all say 
plays bad ass tunes breaky funky tekno weirdness at its best.. very good 
sets..

And Tino-corp rocked the Mutha fuckin house!!! there set was just insane 
buck-nutty samples galore with tekno mania I did not get to see much of them 
cause I was chit chatting with old friends that I have not seen at parties 
in ages!! but overall very good party with a wicked older ravey,hippie FnF, 
tech-geek  kind of crowd.

You will fo sho see me at the next otherworld party, gotta love that space 
too :)

Mac

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Other world Review!!

I'll just never forget seeing someone that appeared to be jack dangers run
to the front door area screaming about *a fire in the bassment* while he
tried to get into the fire hose thing on the wall. Got him to not bust the
glass out and then checked the guys bathroom to see if the basement was on
fire. Turns out he meant *bass bin* or I just heard him wrong. Apparently
Kid606 was screwing with the sound guy and basically appeared to be trying
to blow up the system. Then some water was splashed onto some gear and
apparently caused damage.

I agree 100% with the time slot placement of Cat5. Well, perhaps maybe room
placement. Had the second room been setup as a second room with independent
sound I would have surely stuck them in there. Until Freaky Chakra and
Single Cell came on people were just milling about. Rather killed things in
the beginning for me. It was great running into so many people I know. That
made things a hell of a lot better. I do have to say I loved the Little 15
remix that Cat5 did on the fly. I was in the smoking area singing along.
Hahaha.

Tino Corp stole the night. Jack Dangers was doing full visuals in time with
the music they were creating. Not often you see an act that does its own
music and live visuals. Musically the shit was awesome. I hung around that
massive sweatbox of a room just because I was hooked on what I heard. Damn
it got hot during their set. Sadly once Tino Corp was off everything turned
to noise crap.

Sorry to those that like that shit, but it licked major balls. Cleared the
fucking room pretty damn well too. Hell it cleared the party out within an
hour. That crap just plain hurt. Seemed like the noise kids were doing
everything they could to cause sound distortion on their end and the
system's end. What a fucking joke. When the sound got turned off on one of
the noise kiddies I had to yell *LOOK WHAT YOU DID. YOUR NOISE BROKE THE
SOUND* Kid just looked like a dear in headlights. Hell I was only kidding
too. But I was GLAD that the plug got pulled for a bit.

I didn't stick around much longer after that. Most of the time during the
noise shit was spent chatting it up in the halls. That was the only refuge
from the main room. All in all worth the $10 to see Tino Corp alone. It was
even better seeing friends out that night.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Shazbot Minimalism TONIGHT, 6-8pm

Hey folx,

Tonight I'll be testing out a new weekly timeslot at the In House
Records red room. Unfortunately Minimal Monday and Teknotika SF are
gone, but if you enjoyed those nights I think you'll like what I've got
in store: deep techno and house, electro, dub, and everything in
between. Labels like Playhouse, Sub Static, Mosaic, Trapez, Seasons,
Burial Mix, Poker Flat and Morris Audio. Artists like Morgan Geist,
Isolee, Villalobos, Phonique, Carls Finlow & Craig, and much much more.

So if you appreciate stuff like this, if you don't know what the hell
I'm talking about and you'd like to hear something new, or if you're
just bored out of your skull... hit this up at 6pm tonight:

<http://throwdown.com/throwdown/live/in_house_records.asp>

or tune your Windows Media Player to:

<mms://www.throwdown.com/InHouseRecords>

Then swing by the live chat and make fun of me. Or just sit back, light
one up and listen. See? Mondays don't have to suck.

Chili cheese fries,

PS: I'll be out of the town for the 4th so I won't be doing this next
week, but when I get back it will be a weekly thing. Thanks for
listening!

i heard that jack dangers was *not* present at the OW party,
and that it was incorrectly billed as tino corp.

from what i heard, the live performance was by DHS, who is tino
corp, minus jack.

jack is an old looking dude, last time i saw him he had a grey
beard.

Cactus extract lessens hangovers
Cactus extract lessened the symptoms of a hangover

If you want to drink but you don't want a hangover, a plant extract could 
be the answer, a study suggests.

US researchers at Tulane University found extracts of a prickly pear cactus 
lessened hangover symptoms such as nausea and a dry mouth.

They believe the extract works by reducing stress caused to the body by 
impurities in alcoholic drinks.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

I just looked at pictures and the guy I thought was jack was in fact Ben
Stokes. Interesting to hear that little tidbit. Regardless, the music was
fucking good and everything after it sucked ass. =)

whoever they are (be it tino/dhs/mbm/jack) they all kick ass.

a party setting is the best way to see them perform, IMHO.  i
saw tino corp at the moogfest and it was a bit of a yawner
because it was set up like a concert.

glad you guys had a good time - i was busy getting drunk on the
sunset boatparty in LA.  ;)

helps.

Subject: [sfraves] dj scion [bling bling thing]

for a short while I owned a camper. I toyed with the idea of pimping
it out, of creating the first-ever pimped-out big-rims lowrider
camper. (picture a Winnebago that can hop.)

I even imagined doing this:

http://www.djzone.net/pg/djnews/live/scion-partners-with-five-.shtml

the bit with the Pioneer mixer, the two CDJs, and the two Technics,
all on a custom rack extending using hydraulics? I really did think
about doing that.

(yet somehow I restrained myself.)

'Twas true.  I'm doing the sublet hop right now, and I realized all too
late that the records I really needed for the gig were in storage, and
my storage unit was inaccessible at that hour.  So, off to Open Mind and
Amoeba I went!!  I had just enough time to categorize my finds before
heading out for the set.

And now that I'm back in town, I'll be able to see just what I played.

Oh, and I also don't joke about what record I'm going to start a set
with. ;)

who the girl dissed because she thought he was boring. he said he had
the number one dance CD in the country and the whole time I was trying
to figure out who he was.

Lollapalooza Goes Down – Again




By Scott Thill, AlterNet
Posted on June 29, 2004, Printed on June 30, 2004
http://www.alternet.org/story/19082/

"Our plight is a true indication of the general health of the touring 
industry and it is across musical genres...We are taking Lollapalooza back 
and plan on rebuilding and recreating the festival in surroundings more 
conducive to the cultural experience we've become known for." – Perry Farrell

In 1997, Lollapalooza – Perry Farrell's alternative music and lifestyle 
road show – shut down after a strong seven-year run. The traveling festival 
ended on a dissonant note, squeezing underwhelming bands like Prodigy, 
Korn, The Orb, and Orbital onto the stage that once housed giants like 
Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth, Wu Tang Clan, Ice Cube and the Beastie Boys.

The tour was revived in 2003 with a lackluster lineup – with Farrell's 
Jane's Addiction, supergroup Audioslave, Jurassic 5 and the Donnas 
headlining. The reduced starpower contributed to weak ticket sales, but 
Farrell still carried the torch: Fast forward to 2004, and Lollapalooza 
seemed to be burning bright.

Farrell and company believed, some would argue rightly so, that a line-up 
consisting of the Pixies, Morrissey, PJ Harvey, The Flaming Lips, Modest 
Mouse, Sonic Youth (again) and Wilco would be enough to get iPod Nation up 
off its recliners this summer. Apparently, they guessed wrong. Lollapalooza 
2004, citing million dollar losses and anemic sales, had to pull up stakes 
on the two-month, cross-country sonic spree.

Whether or not this is a massive bummer depends on whom you're talking to. 
If you're talking to the MTV-addled bubble-poppers who've made tired Gs 
like 50 Cent and Us Weekly-selling starlets like J.Lo into platinum 
superstars, well, they'll get over it. And if you're talking post-slackers 
that helped explode alternative music through the Lollapalooza aorta since 
the festival took its first breath in 1991, it seems that they might not 
have the economic clout they had in the '90s.

But whomever you're talking to, either they're not interested, not aware, 
or not in possession of the ample funds it takes to gain access to a 
festival concert these days. As Perry notes above, the health of the 
touring industry is bordering on convalescent, and it's not just 
Lollapalooza that has breathed its last gasp. Last year, the diverse indie 
rock festival All Tomorrow's Parties – curated by Matt Groening (you may 
remember him from such hit TV shows as The Simpsons or Futurama) and 
featuring compelling acts like Patti Smith, The Breeders, Nick Cave and a 
host of innovative bands – had to cancel its Los Angeles date due to 
sluggish ticket sales.

Not all is lost when it comes to blockbuster package tours. Vans Warped is 
still going comparatively strong, and it's landing in just as many cities 
as Lollapalooza. But Vans Warped, as the name implies, is heavily 
sponsored; everyone from big guns like Vans, Hurley, MTV and Dodge to small 
fries like Slim Jim, Ernie Ball and Hot Topic are lending their weight and 
support to the skateboarding phenomenon. Plus, with what looks like – 
according to the event's official site – around 200 bands along for the 
ride, most of them skewed to a much younger demographic, they're arguably 
giving more bang for your buck.

But demographics don't tell the whole story. Consider OzzFest, which is 
still going strong – though Ozzy Osbourne himself has been running on empty 
for years and his TV show is a shadow of its former self. If critics of 
Lolla think Sonic Youth and The Pixies are too old, then how to explain the 
attraction of OzzFest's 2004 headliner, a reunited Black Sabbath? They've 
got the Pixies beat by two decades in the age category. True, OzzFest 
remains relevant by lumping in younger acts like Slipknot, Hatebreed and 
others, but their main stage acts in 2004 – Sabbath, Judas Priest and 
Slayer – reads like a headbanger's history book.

As usual, age doesn't explain everything. Sure, Lollapalooza fans are 
getting old, but they're still getting involved. In addition to the stellar 
headliners, the tour had partnered with MoveOn.org to provide, as the 
festival always has, discussions, solutions, and avenues for change during 
what's shaping up to be the Armageddon of election years. This year's model 
was going to be the Revolution Solution Tent, a teach-in of sorts focusing 
on environmental concerns, workers' rights, media deregulation, free speech 
and other issues vital to the arts community; they even had a solar-powered 
stage geared up for action, featuring punk veteran and Minutemen bassist 
Mike Watt as a headliner. The always engaging Watt also penned a running 
diary for Lollapalooza on their official site, but a quick click of the 
site's "Sponsors" tab tells the whole story. Blank page.

Some of the blame may lie with Farrell, who had similar problems launching 
2003's comeback Lollapalooza. Originally planning to kick off the festival 
in Ionia, Michigan on July 3rd, Rolling Stone reported that Farrell 
cancelled the date and rescheduled; in what may be debated as a symbol of 
Farrell's ego or a funny coincidence, the Lollapalooza party line argued 
that the Jane's Addiction's set simply couldn't fit on the Fairgrounds 
stage. But officials at the venue replied that Farrell's excuse was a red 
herring; the show had only sold 4,000 tickets and the Fairgrounds main 
stage had played anywhere from two to five times that capacity before. 
Making matters worse, the tour had a scheduled stop in Detroit, which, some 
asserted, cut into Ionia's sales. No matter how you slice it, that show had 
problems before the curtain ever lifted.

And they continue. The problem of "poor ticket sales" takes its place with 
the others – "too mainstream," "too old," "too masculine," "too white" – 
plaguing Lolla since it more or less ended in 1997. Which is truly a sorry 
State of the Slacker Union address, considering the impressive firepower 
Farrell amassed for 2004's old college try. After all, the Pixies have sold 
out almost all of their other reunion dates within minutes; but even they 
couldn't keep the Lolla boat afloat. Which if you ask diehard fans (like 
myself, I admit), it just goes to show that Farrell should've tabbed them 
for his journeying think piece back when they were changing music forever.

Which is another way of saying that Lolla's 2004 line-up might have caused 
a Who-like stampede had it hit the stage in 1991 or 1992, when most of the 
headliners were at their best. But now yesteryear's teenagers and 
twenty-somethings are well on their way to middle age, and shelling out a 
Trump-load of cash for water bottles and bad fries to sit in the blazing 
sun for two days straight amongst drunks and frat boys just doesn't sound 
like fun anymore.

So whether you're blaming Farrell, the aging lineup and its older 
demographic, the ailing "health of the touring industry," Clear Channel's 
stranglehold on the live show circuit, or the fact that most Americans just 
don't have the kind of disposable income they possessed last decade, 
Lollapalooza's cancellation is a wake-up call to all of those who think 
that crafting an attractive lineup is all is takes to pack them in.

Lollapalooza 2004's brilliant lineup is perhaps too little, too late. Too bad.

"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the 'Universe,' a part 
limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and 
feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion 
of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting 
us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. 
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles 
of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in 
its beauty."

Interesting read. I don't think he got it all right though. One of his
major points is that people aren't going to see concerts because they
don't have disposable income they had 10 years ago. He doesn't give any
supporting evidence for this, and I think he's wrong on this point. For
example:

Bottom line, people don't want to go to a big festival with a bunch of
indie bands from the 80s and 90s. Lollapalooza blew it on their
demographics.

I say it was purely a matter of choice in lineup. If that lineup had
rolled in back in the first years of Lollapalooza (91+) it *would*
have gone off. Fast-forward to today and it becomes a nostalgic show
for a limited audience that has since moved on. What is remarkable
about the first years of Lollapalooza is the lineups that show brought
to town at that time. I would think that Perry needs to retool
Lollapalooza and apply that formula to this day and age. Not too many
high school kids with limited income are going to shell out hard
earned cash for groups that they don't really know. Warped Tour gets
it right. The lineup of uber-popular pop-punk draws in the kids. Toss
in a media blast and you can damn well bet it's going to sell out.

I see certain parallels between raves and concerts here. Cater to the
demographic that will attend.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Lollapalooza Goes Down 
     =?iso-8859-1?Q?=96_Again?=

i'm still mad that i don't get to see Morrissey.

i don't care that he is over his prime or that his "new" music is just
re-vamped old music with hot new producers. (see "how can you possibly
know how i feel?", new cut, but classic morrissey / smiths style lyrics)

when i discovered the Smiths in '86 they were already over.  they hadn't
attained commercial success or noteriety (sp?), but their best music was
already made.

by the time a band makes it to a festival, they are already played out.

i know this.  i don't expect to goto a festival to find cutting edge new
music or to see artists that would drive ticket sales for that matter.

i just wanna see Morrissey.

heaven knows i'm miserable now,
Jonas

A sad fact widely known
How the most impassionate song
To a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs
That made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe
On the bedroom floor
And said: "Oh, smother me, Mother..." 

Morrisey said it best...

--Patrick.

Subject: [sfraves] *HAPPY TOGETHER 3! Saturday, September 4th! $1 Presales / ALL AGES  <bsp>

Yeah, we know. It's been almost 2 years since the last one. There hasn't 
been a single party we get asked more about, so here it is, the finale.. 
Liquidvinyldjs.com is unbelieveably proud to present:

HAPPY TOGETHER 3
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 4TH 2004
LABOR DAY WEEKEND
ALL AGES | 9:00pm-6:00am
2000+ CAPACITY BAY AREA LOCATION!


We've taken great pride in putting together this once in a lifetime lineup! 
Prepare for one of the biggest hard lineups the West Coast has ever seen!


SCOTT BROWN
|| Evolution Records - Scotland || *FIRST BAY AREA APPEARANCE!*
Considered by many around the world as Hardcore's #1 DJ and Producer, Scott 
Brown has achieved more in his career than many in any other genre. He's 
developed his Evolution Records label into what many reguard as the top 
Hardcore label in the world, along with releasing tracks with many of 
Hardcore's top Producers. With massive hits like "ELYSIUM", "NOW IS THE 
TIME", "TURN UP THE MUSIC", and "ICE COLD", chances are if you've been to a 
party in the past 10 years, you've heard his music. As a DJ, he is known for 
his rock solid skills on the decks, often building his sets into energetic 
frenzies that result in mayhem after it's all said and done! This will be 
Scott Brown's first Bay Area Appearance, please join us to make it 
memorable!

DJ HIXXY
|| RaverBaby / HTID / Bonkers - U.K. ||
>From his novice DJ days in 1991 to his International Hardcore Superstar 
status of today, Hixxy has worked long and hard making a name for himself in 
the Hardcore circuit. From his early releases "TOY TOWN" and "WANTING TO GET 
HIGH" to his current hits "TANTRIC" and his remix of "FALLING IN", Hixxy has 
enjoyed enormous success as a Producer. As a DJ, Hixxy helped launch the 
enormously popular "BONKERS" series on React, which continues to break sales 
records for Hardcore CD compilations. His mixes are known to be uplifting 
and energetic, so be ready as we bring Hixxy for a very rare USA appearance!

TOMMYKNOCKER
|| Traxtorm Records - Italy || *FIRST BAY AREA APPEARANCE!*
As one of the fastest rising Hardcore producers today, we are extremely 
excited to bring you Tommyknocker for his first Bay Area Appearance. Hailing 
from Italy, his unique sound has been in demand by all of the world's top 
Hardcore DJs, with hard hittin' releases like "THE AFTERMATH", "REVOLUTION", 
and "DEMOLITION". He is also an accomplished DJ, playing huge events like 
Love Parade, Hellraiser, Megarave, and Masters of Hardcore. If you like your 
Hardcore rough and rugged, Tommyknocker is your man!

DELTA 9
|| Psychotik Records / Adam Recordings - Chicago, IL || *FIRST BAY AREA 
APPEARANCE!*
Quite possibly the biggest name in American Hardcore, Delta 9 is widely 
respected and admired throughout the world of Hardcore. With his early 
releases like "HARDCORE CHICAGO", "HATE TANK", and "REAL HARDCORE", to his 
present material like "DONKEY PUNCH", "NO ESCAPE", and "PUNK LOSER", he 
continues to evolve his style to the Hardcore massive. He has appeared all 
around the globe showcasing his incredible DJ skills and crowd control, 
often taking crowds beyond their peak and back again. We are proud to 
present to you Delta 9 for his first Bay Area Appearance!

DJ VENOM
|| Volume Productions / Topaz Records - Providence, RI || *FIRST BAY AREA 
APPEARANCE!*
Looked upon as one of the most talented Hard DJ's in America, Venom's style 
and persona are only comparible to his music: wild and crazy! He goes 
seamlessly from US Hard House to Hardcore in his mixes, as showcased on such 
top-selling CD compilations as his "RAISE THE VOLUME" series, his "STRAIGHT 
BANGIN" series, and the immensely popular "HOUSE BLEND VOLUME 7-8". From his 
jaw-dropping scratching to his crowd rockin stage displays, it's no wonder 
why Venom is in such huge demand all around the country. We are hyped to 
bring you DJ Venom's first Bay Area Appearance!


CLOUDSKIPPER
|| Raw Elements / KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
The one, the only. Cloudskipper is widely recognized and respected as one of 
the top Hardcore DJ's in America. With his recent tour of the U.K. as well 
as his very busy touring here in North America, crowds all around the world 
continue to be amazed and captivated by his upfront Hardcore sets. Often 
immitated, never duplicated, Cloudskipper sets the bar other Hardcore DJ's 
will be trying to reach... next year.

DJ TRONIC
|| Resistance Recordings / Liquidvinyldjs.com / BeatSupreme.com ||
Label owner. Producer. DJ. Promoter. Is there anything he doesn't do? 
Probably not. DJ Tronic has continued to build his label Resistance 
Recordings from the ground up, watching it become one of the premiere Hard 
labels in the world with many top DJ's playing his material. All this along 
with his recent touring of France and Spain, as well as his busy touring 
schedule in the USA, it's no wonder why Tronic is such a rising talent.


THE NICE GUYS [NO LEFT TURN & DJ REESE]
|| KFA / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
When they're not out being nice somewhere, they're out getting drunk. All 
jokes aside, these two are starting to make waves in the Hardcore world, 
with their two upcoming releases on KFA, as well as other material released 
on Raw Elements and Bedlam. Prepare for the Nice Guys, dropping a 
not-so=nice set!

THE NATURAL DISASTERS [THE DOCTOR & RECLIPSE]
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com ||
The Doctor and Reclipse, forces in their own right come together to form the 
Natural Disasters. While they're not wrestlers, they drop some of the 
hardest hittin material in the Bay, ranging from DrumNBass to Hardcore to 
Gabber, these two will be shaking the dancefloor HARD!

J-MARR & CARLOS ALFONZO
|| Bayraves.com / Liquidvinyldjs.com / Soop Recordings / BeatSupreme.com || 
[/b]
Alright, the last time we had these two together during a set, they did more 
passing out of food than actually playing. While we can't promise the same 
feast, we can promise a rockin set that only these two can bring!

Delta9 used to make these videos that are a sorta low budget Jackass...
with awesome gags like having their pictures taken with big names DJs with
their cocks hanging out of their pants, interviewing kids at parties that
are puking off their E, snowboarding into bushes and faking car accidents.

Seems immature, sure... but's it's great how well these things are edited
and funny as all hell.  And shy of some weird change in the last few
years, he plays good old' american midwest warehouse/barn/legionhall paint
peeling hardcore without the happy.

whoot!

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Republicans for Nader/Democrats for Badnarik?

	If the Democrats were smart, they'd go tit for tat and start helping 
Michael Badnarik and the Libertarian Party take voters who believe in 
limited government away from the Republicans.

	The problem is, most Democrats still haven't recognized that Bush is 
all about big government, so it's hard for them to relate to the fact 
that he could lose a lot of votes on that issue.

					<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - It's a mistake to assume that everybody who votes for Nader 
would otherwise vote for Kerry. The second choice of many Nader 
supporters would be David Cobb, the Green Party candidate. Growing 
numbers of people are coming to realize that both the establishment 
parties are the problem, and won't vote for Bush or Kerry no matter 
what.

Subject: [sfraves] delta 9 changed my life

delta 9 poisoned me when i saw him play in L.A. (orange show complex) (1996)

i was horrified by his intense evil nature.

it was 6am.  i was coming down and looking fwd to some morning house.

he deprived me of such a comfort and proceeded to split my skull / psyche
/ personality until i felt like i might do things that were terribly
wrong.

i wanted the onslaught to stop, but that just made him pound me more.

i had know idea that such music existed before that.

if techno is the music of the devil, delta 9 must be the devil's own
torture dementia master.

Sound With Space and Motion

June 29, 2004


  A conversation snaps around you. A string trio plays in front of you as 
you turn your attention from cello to violin. A soprano walks across the 
stage, and you turn your head to follow her voice. Conventional sound 
recording cannot capture those experiences -- but an invention by audio 
engineers at the University of California, Davis is changing that.

  Motion-tracked binaural sound (MTB) captures cues for direction, distance 
and movement and the subtleties of natural, ambient sound that other 
systems don't. Developed by Ralph Algazi, Richard Duda and Dennis Thompson 
at the Interface Laboratory in the UC Davis Center for Image Processing and 
Integrated Computing (CIPIC), the patent-pending technique uses 
off-the-shelf equipment that won't break the bank.

For the listener, it's an eerie experience of listening to invisible people 
talking, playing music or singing around you while you can turn your 
attention from one to another.

  "Conventional audio playback doesn't reflect how you hear in real life," 
Algazi said. "Your body, the shape of your head and the room acoustics all 
affect how you hear."

  Conventional binaural recording uses microphones embedded in a dummy head 
to record sound, so that playback through headphones mimics the recording. 
That method does a fair job of reproducing sounds to the left and right but 
not to the front, where sounds appear to come from immediately in front of 
or behind your head. Furthermore, it doesn't allow for movement, Duda said.

  "The problem is that people do not keep still," Duda said.

  The new method records through multiple microphones (eight for voice, 16 
for music) spaced around a head-sized ball or cylinder. The sound is played 
back through headphones with a small tracking device attached to the top to 
follow head movements. As you turn your head while listening, the system 
mixes sound from different microphones, reproducing what you would hear if 
you were in the room.

  Listeners can move their heads to locate a sound source, turn to "face" a 
person speaking and tell when sound sources are nearby or far away. In 
addition, MTB captures the ambient sounds of the location, so you recognize 
the echoes in a church or the confines of a conference room.

The engineers have made sample recordings with musicians from the UC Davis 
music department and visiting classical and bluegrass musicians.

  "The system can capture the sound of instruments much more fully than a 
conventional single microphone. It captures changes in sound and the 
effects of a room in a way that is much closer to reality," Algazi said.

"I think they have something really wonderful," said Pablo Ortiz, chair of 
the Department of Music at UC Davis.

  "The thing that's interesting to me is the way that it records space," 
Ortiz said.

  William Beck, a composer of electronic music and lecturer in the music 
department, said that live recordings could be a major application.

  "The 'being there' feel is something people would really like," Beck said.

  The technique could also be used for teleconferencing, computer games and 
virtual- or augmented-reality systems. The work, which is supported by 
grants from the National Science Foundation, was presented at the 116th 
Convention of the Audio Engineering Society held in May 2004 in Berlin, 
Germany.

  The CIPIC Interface Laboratory is a multidisciplinary research center 
that studies human perception and its role in the interface between humans 
and machines.

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes 
me to tremble for the safety of my country.  As a result of the war, 
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is 
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-Abraham Lincoln

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

  "I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

i was horrified by his intense evil nature.

it was 6am. i was coming down and looking fwd to some morning house.

he deprived me of such a comfort and proceeded to split my skull / psyche
/ personality until i felt like i might do things that were terribly
wrong.

i wanted the onslaught to stop, but that just made him pound me more.

i had know idea that such music existed before that.

if techno is the music of the devil, delta 9 must be the devil's own
torture dementia master.

"Nearly 10 percent of contributors who have given Nader at least $250
have a history of supporting the Republican president, national GOP
candidates or the party, according to computer-assisted review of
financial records.

Among the new crop of Nader donors: actor and former Nixon
speechwriter Ben Stein, Florida frozen-food magnate Jeno Paulucci and
Pennsylvania oil-company executive Terrence Jacobs. All have strong
ties to the GOP."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] delta 9 changed my life

hahahahah this is a solid story. I'll never forget the first time I saw him, 
Invasion 2 in 1997 in SoCal at the San Bernardino Sports Arena. Absolute 
mind blowing set, I always said if I ever threw parties, I'd have him come 
play.. and low and behold, I'm having him come play.

Anyone who likes it rough and rugged, make sure to come out and see D9 rock 
it on September 4th!
