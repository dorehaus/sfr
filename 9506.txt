Rick,

I worked for 11 hours today and when I stepped outside, the sun was 
setting and something was seriously going on because the sky in the west 
was the richest shade of peach I have ever seen and I just stood there 
like a dope with my mouth gaping wide open at the intense view.  Every 
cloud in the sky had highlights of peach on one side and I decided that 
it was well worth the wait.

Or at least, it seemed like it was getting busted...

In case anybody was thinking of checking this party out, I thought i'd
let you know....

Yeah, so we were like major wussies, so we ran for some random dark
path through the woods as soon as we saw the flashlights and heard 'em
say "ok, everybody stay put". "Yeah Right" says I as we run over
bramble and under bush.

It was a very cool party location though; dark n' spooky woods and 
overgrowth gave a nice windbreak, making it completely uneccessary for
us to dress like antartic explorers. 

I kinda figured something was going to happen given the park-ranger car
i saw around midnight, and what with the location too close to the
great hwy parking lot.

Thanks to SPAZ for the party, hope all is well and that the cops
weren't unreasonable in busting the party. After we ran away, the 
music started again, and a large assembly of squad cars began to appear
on the great hwy parking lot near the party site. Looked like there
were about as many cops as there were ravers at the party. :-)

In the future, a designated sacrifical raver virgin (gets free E!
secondary virginity acceptable) should be given the task of placating
the police in order to let the party continue.... "Oh I just love the
texture on your baton.... please club me over the head with it some
more! And you're such a good listener too!" :->

PS: while all this was going on (say midnight-2AM) there were people
partying on the beach around campfires, despite signs that explicitly
stated "no fires" (and doesn't the beach close at 10PM??). Seems like
raving in the woods is somehow worse than an illegal campfire or
loitering on the beach.

     I meant to post the msg below to the group rather than just directly 
     to Brian D. re:  his msg a couple of weeks ago asking "If anyone had a 
     good time at 1015?".  After reading Tracy's msg, I thought I should 
     dig it up to reiterate how we wear different masks (sometimes 
     unconsciously) and how it can be deceiving to people.  Heck, last week 
     Friday, I wore my Pollyanna-ish flouncy white shirt directly from work 
     to 1015 and Mo' Funk (or whatever that was) and then to the End-Up.  
     Some people looked at me in amazement to this ol' gal getting down and 
     some came up to me telling me that I didn't look like a raver.  Yet, 
     here I was schmoozing with the regulars.  What's up with that, they 
     wanted to know?  The bottom line, I told them was not what you were 
     wearing on the outside but what was going on inside.  Then your true 
     light will shine.  
     
     Hugs and kisses,
     Diane
     ----
     Brian,
     
     I'm sorry you had a bad time at 1015.  Yes, there were lots of 
     different folks at the gig but by 2-3pm many of the "clubbers" had 
     left and the regulars were going off.  True, this was the first time I 
     was at Brothers & Sisters, but I've gone out enough to know faces in 
     the scene and they were there.  Also, could it have been a result of 
     netters getting a freebie?  Hey, look I even made it there ;)
     
     Regardless, if we rave (for me at least), isn't part of it about 
     accepting everyone for where they're at and appreciating the 
     individual way they get off through music and dance?  Again, for me 
     it's the acceptance that leads us to connectedness.  So whatever you 
     wear and how old you are shouldn't make a difference.  I always feel 
     that if I come with a positive vibe and project it, more will come to 
     you.
     
     I know my brother (a "retired" old-time raver) and I go through 
     discussions about keeping the scene underground.  He's all for it and 
     I have mixed feelings.  Yet he and I were amused the other day when I 
     told him that driving back from Basics, we got some strange looks from 
     people at a gas station/market because "a small Asian Woman wearing a 
     black leather jacket (wannabe tough chick) driving a spanking new 
     _family_ car (yuppie-$$) w/a crashed out hippie (peace, love & rasta) 
     and a tall black man (potentially threatening to red necks)" was such 
     a cross section, that they couldn't figure out what brought us 
     together.  Where else would you get this?  Antioch, Fairfield or 
     wherever we were was probably as amused as us 8) [Hey, I know I'll 
     probably get flamed for my descriptions but 1) they're meant 
     tongue-in-cheek; and 2) think about it...how do we look at others if 
     we didn't know eachother and we were passing on the street?  Now, 
     think about how differently we react when we know the person or their 
     vibe...]
     
     And _YES_, I did invite some friends of mine who have always been 
     curious about raves but didn't know how to get to one.  From what I've 
     heard about Brothers & Sisters, it would be a good middle-ground place 
     to introduce them so I had a couple of them come out this weekend.  If 
     you multiply this by a few, then there'd be a good percentage of 
     newbies to either infuse the scene w/more energy or to drive it 
     underground.
     
     Hope the rest of your weekend was better.
     
     Diane

Thanks to all who came down to Brothers and Sisters last week.

This week's line-up is:  Tracy
Spun
Jan Cooley
As usual anyone from SF Raves gets in free on our guest list.
Just tell the girl at the door that you are from SF Raves and it will 
be all good.
Thanks for all the support, hope to see you all this Friday at 1015.
And to all of those that are worried about the vibe for one reason or 
another. The club always gets better when the bar closes because 
shortly after that the gold room closes, since that seems to be the 
one that apalls certain individuals.  

I think that we all need to drop out pre-conceived notions that 
because someone is wearing a suit or dressed nice means that there is 
something wrong with them.  I have been the resident dj for Brothers 
and Sisters, formally Soundsystem for six months now.  I must admit, 
at first I thought they were dorks but after meeting a few of them I 
discovered that alot of them are cool people that have never 
experienced a good groove.  There are several so called "suits" that 
come to Brothers and Sisters regularly that are really good people 
just trying to unwind with their friends.  I think that it is about 
time that we drop the negitive stereotypes and start communicating.  
That way rather than judging people based on what they look like, 
take the time to find out what they are about, you may be surprised, 
there are a lot of subversive individuals out there you just have to 
get past fear and introduce yourself.
If we want our scene to grow and maintain diversisty we need to start 
being less closed-minded and judgemental of people that we have never 
met.  There are good people and bad people.  Anyway, what were you 
like before you discovered the House Movement?  Sometimes we all seem 
to forget our past.

Just a few kind words.

dj Tracy, Brothers and Sisters

and what they wear, their color or whatever really is unimportant

I hardly go out to anything anymore, last night was a very positive exception.
I went to see the hip-hop group the Roots @ DNA.
All I can say is that the place was bumpin', and the crowd was more positive
than I had come to expect.

One thing that I noticed, right off, were the multitude of colors present in the audience.  Amazing, and everybody was all about getting a groove on, smoking some green, and listening to a slammin set!  
Kinda reminded me of the old days of rave.  Kinda reminds me that the only way this thing we call rave will survive in any relevant form is thru diversity.

People I saw: DJ Mark Farina, DJ Josh, Ron C. of Nitty Gritty, Adria.
Fights arguments disturbances: ZERO
Diversity: 100%
Music:  I thought people playing real instruments were passe.  I've now been informed ;).

Style: 100% hip-hop freestyle in da booty wit no vaseline!

Ain't seen such fine sistahs of all colors from all over in a long time.  

Late,
John

I have (1) 1200 in mint condition for sale for $300. It has a Stanton

I would prefer to sell it in San Franciso Bay Area.

It's Thursday night, and my housemate's under-21 daughter is in town, 
and I'm wanting to show her some of the ole vibe.  Any raveish 
gatherings happening in/around SF tonight that she could get into 
without needing to hassle with proof of drinking age?

All clues appreciated!  Is Eighth House (at 1190 Folsom) 18+?  
Somehow I doubt it... plus that sounds like the SPAZ posse and does 
anyone know if all their gear got confiscated last night?  Sure as 
hell hope not....

Hello All.  I'm throwin a phat little  hip-hop/deep house party in my SOMA 
wharehouse this friday night. The problem being that these partys get too big 
for the space (otherwise I'd love to invite all you SFRAVERS), so we thought 
it might be good to get someone to help maintain the door. So if anyone is up 
for 2-3 hours (11:30-2:30) of door work in exchange for $$ or other 
incentives, and a good party, let me know via email  
ASAP. 
 
Thanks and thanks.....Aaron (aedsinge@us.oracle.com)

Yeah...I want to take this thing slowly and carfully.  I realize that to 
accomplish what I want accomplished at this rave (a great event with 
hopefully a big soundsystem and a lot of people just enjoying the vibe of 
the forrest and the music) that I cannot afford it all myself.  I decided 
a while ago that I wil NOT charge anything for this event.  NOTHING will 
make me change my mind about that.  However if I can get some people to 
put up some money up front and then give whatever I get in donations back 
then hopefully this thing will really thump.  Like I said in my previous 
post, this guy as far as I know, does not plan on getting any of his 
money back, he just wants to see a good rave go off (which seems to be 
directly in line with me views).  Also I hope that all the DJs will do it 
for free since I will not pay any of them....not enuff $$$, besides the 
whole essence of this is to return to the forrest and not have to worry 
about the pressures of society and money.  So if I can get some big name 
DJs who will do it for free I would really appreciate it (hopefully some 
of these numbers I got will work out), if not, there is nothing wrong 
with new talent.   Unknowns are somtimes better, the only prob is it 
won't attract as many people...

does anybody have any comments, criticizms, or praise for this idea?  I 
am perfectly welcome to take ANY advice constructively as long as it 
doesn't have the words "fuck" and "yourself" in it.  8-)  Oh well, I 
guess I better go.

I just wanted to thank everyone for a wonderful weekend!  It was one of 
the best I've had in quite some time.  Stompy on Friday night was slow 
getting going (or maybe I just got there early), but after a few hours it 
went off!  There was a great core crowd of very positive people that made 
it impossible not to smile.  The sound system was great, excellent 
visuals and great music.  Best of all it was at the Townsend.  This is a 
great space...I wish it were used more often.  
	Sunset on Sunday was no less than perfect.  Great weather, music 
and friends.  It was great to see some very familiar faces, and get some 
great hugs (thanks Brian).  After washing off the dust from all 
that dancing at sunset we headed over to Spundae.  A clubby crowd, but an 
absolutely wonderful time.
	Thanks again to everyone that put on these parties and everyone 
that went to them and made them so special.  I have a great feeling about 
this summer... 

big smiles,
Andrew

I think DJs should be eager and willing to:

 o work for free
 o carry speakers and amplifiers
 o help set up and clean up
 o behave like caring, considerate human beings while engaged in the above

DJs that won't do the above, I would disconsider as a matter of principle.
But that's just my opinion =)

I guess that is pretty much how I see it too.  Definitely the first and 
the last!  However the middle two are somewhat negotiable.  I am glad to 
see that so many people on all the lists are in the sam frame of mind as 
me.  It is really encouraging.  Well gotta go...

Until the forrest pumps...

Christian -

If the forest is as you have descibed it (and I believe you fully) and you
get a sound system and all the works up there, I don't think you'll have
any problem getting people to go.  Whether you have huge name DJs or
locally known DJs.  You are going to attract ravers that will want to be
outside for a couple days.  That in itself will filter out those that say,
"Hell man, I hate so-in-so and he's spinning."  Or the raver that say, "I
can't believe they're going to have three days of outdoor raving for free
and there isn't one DJ I want to hear.  Fuck that!"

My point is, I don't think you're going to have to "hire" a big name DJ to
pull in the people.  If anything it's as much who's helping to put it
together as it is who's spinning.  Plus this would be such a great
opportunity to mix so many different raving communities.  Right there is a
problem in finding a DJ universally known to Southern California and SF and
Davis and wherever else people would be coming from.  One community's spin
God is another community's unknown.  Capice'?

Gotta go!

Tony

Yes herbal extasy is weaker then it's sythetic counterpart.  Which is all 
fine and good if you have never taken the genuine article because your 
body does not know what to expect.  Herbal E is for people who people who 
have never taken MDMA; it's kind of like the idea that gurana (in 
large amounts) used to put me off my nut until I started taking speed 
then it was like no buzz at all.  Personally a good strong cup of coffee 
and a few big bong hits is the same as E anyway so whats th epoint?

In the July issue of Playboy there was this short blurb 

(From "Playboy After Hours" 7/95 issue)

                             WILD OATS

Looks like a young mover and shaker at Quaker Oats knows a thing or two about 
acid trance. Packages of Instant Quaker Oatmeal now sport bits of pop trive on 
such subjects as hip-hop, rave, fanzines and grunge. One demanding 
multiple-choice question asked kids: "What's the difference between house 
music and rave music?" Fortunately for the parents, the answer was listed on 
the same packet: "House music is generally 120 beats per minute, rave is 132 
beats per minute."


I thought it was kinda funny.

Courtesy of the Super I-way , I'm sending this from southern California :).
The line isn't that fast though, so I may have missed something someone
has sent during the week (I haven't read all of my mail).  Editing at this
speed is too frustrating, soeveryone else can send their recomendations out
over sfraves...

two friends of mine took the herbal e found in pill form (i believe like they
have at the natural foods store in upper haight) and went to epcot center in
florida. they said the recommended dose of 8 pills was fine, but then they
decided to take more (total intake 15) and it was way too much of whatever it
is. they were stomache sick for 2 or three days and while at the epcot center
went through all these head trips. now these are people who get along fine
with mdma and even some bastard cousins of it. so...

Having done the herbal E thing I was most disappointed. However I have 
heard that it can really potentiate a real E trip. Can anyone 
verify/debunk this(from actual experience please...)

That spot has been used and busted many times.
It's a cool spot but the police and rangers allways drive by at night.

I took herbal E before I ever tried *real* e.  It felt like minithins, except
even a little less potent which is odd because it doesn't take much to get me
f*cked up.  At least i didn't have to pay for it!

I didn't make it to the S.P.A.Z. party, but I remember going to a party 
in GG Pk last July or August where the police showed up and told 
everyone to go down on the beach.  (Unfortunately, this was my early 
rave days so I don't remember whose party it was.)  But once they set up 
the sound system there, the party went off until 5 or 6am, with no 
further hassles from the cops.  Does anyone remember this?

here i am, late at night in the lab, watching those columns drip drip 
drip 

well no, really i'm sitting here in front of the computer.  duh!

right now dj minor minor is on kalx doing some fun stuff.  at the moment, 
it's a slightly disturbing "ambient" selection which i am enjoying very much.

the janitor just wandered in and wanted to know what was making that 
weird noise.  he thought it was the computer and then he saw the radio.  
right now he's mopping the floor, which is very very very dirty.

if anybody's listening and reading, you can call 510-643-KALX (or maybe 
642-KALX..uh..sorry) and say hello to dj minor minor, who is also 
involved with Dust of friday night and rude club staff (or whatever) 
fame.  this party is the only one i know of in quite some time that 
actually booked darcy (dar-cee?  DRC?) who plays kinda hard techno, i'm 
told...but then..i wouldn't know because i haven't heard her play since 
last spring at a New Moon party.

well, i guess you can tell i'm a little bored because those columns are 
taking such a long long long time to drip drip drip.

goodnight for now,

ann

It's a shame the party got busted, but it was inevitable. With the thick 
trees, the Lincoln side was completely silent. Unfortunately, only about 
ten feet of those trees were between us and the Highway. With all the 
cops going up and down hassling the people on the beach, there wasn't a 
chance. It's a shame as it's a beautiful spot. Several years back, we were 
at the very same spot with the Cacophony folks for a game of tag. The 
moon was full but still, the only real light was from the green light 
sticks strung up randomly in the trees. Probably the eeriest and most 
adrenaline-drenched night I've ever experienced in SF. Anyway, the slight 
familiarity with the terrain certainly didn't hurt when the rangers 
showed up ;) Next time someone tries this spot, I'm bringing light sticks.

So what's the deal with the amplified noise curfew anyway? I can 
understand if it's disturbing residents, but the only thing the SPAZ 
party was sonically disturbing was a hundred feet of highway. That grove 
is a haven for drinking and cruising anyway, music or not. At least with 
the music, the rangers would know where we were in case something 
happened. It's funny how public land can only be enjoyed in *approved* ways.

jmar!

I had a brief vision of the sound shutting down and everyone waiting silent 
while the rangers tried in vain to hunt us down. Perhaps a decoy with a 
boombox next time?

I know where the coolest venue in golden gate is for a party.  It's 
called the horseshoe and it is an enclosed concreated area slightly 
raised behind the green house.  A pucker sight if ever there was one.

I wasn't there, but it sounds like Transformer 2's "Pacific Symphony " from
 my favorite techno/house CD - Transformations ( Great
spirit/vibe/PLUR-filled 
stuff, highly recommended! ) The lyric "So Much Joy" sung by by a male voice
occurs prominently in this track. (The title of the track would be
appropriate for 
Sunset. :-) )

Or possibly it could be the track entitled "So Much Love" by Dubtribe,
wherein a
female voice sings "So much love in this world" over and over...

Cheers,

Not that this is a big deal or anything, but I posted a note yesterday to
come say hi to me in the ambient room at Liquid Groove this Saturday....Well
I got a call last night informing me that there isn't going to be an ambient
space there.  The space that the show is taking place in is a big warehouse
with no side rooms.  We did a socalled "ambient" space there before, by
walling off a section with thin plywood we found lying around the room.  It
sucked hard core, because the music had to be as loud or louder than the
main room so the concept of ambient went out the window.  So, bable bable
bable.... Don't look for me in the ambient space to say hi, but if for some
reason you run into me (not that any of you have ever met me or know what I
look like), say hi.  Sorry to take up a band width with seemingly useless
information.

Have fun this weekend.

Rick

Ocean Beach and just about every beach within 30 miles of SF is a bust.
The Beaches are off limits after 10pm.

imho, fewer people is bonus. that is, you definately get a better sense 
of "family" when you're not surrounded by 3,000 people. i like going to 
giant raves (ie Narnia in so.cal.) but i feel like smaller raves (ie 
friends n family with a couple hundred folks) is more conducive to a 
high "hugs-factor". 
big name djs are big crowd-drawers, but i know there are plenty of 
underworked, under-rated, ambitious djs out there who are equally 
talented and would spin with three times as much enthusiasm as some 
dude who typically pulls in $300 for a set. plus, my experience has lead 
me to believe that they have really lost the point of the rave 
scene...and somehow have acquired this condescending attitude...

thanks for listening.

I STILL like the idea of having a good FM transmitter,  broadcasting
the signal to people with Kilowatt sound systems in their car.

When the cops come,   turn UP the sound,   not down.   Then,  when the
cops come to ask you to turn it down,   say "Sure"  and set it back
where it was.

	Actually, if you set up the speakers right against the dunes 
facing toward the water you can't hear it from the highway. I've been to 
several bust free parties where the sound was set up this way. One of 
them even went well into the morning. I also went to an ocean beach party 
(was it Ananda?) where the sound was set up in the middle of the beach 
facing toward the cliffhouse. The cops came but I think it took them at 
least till daylight. Ah yes, that 10pm law doesn't apply to ocean beach 
thank god.

if any one would like to talk with mtv about herbal e for a segment called 
"healthy highs?"
please email me privately 

MTV will be in town on the weekend of the 23rd so if anyone thinks they 
can use this to reflect a positive view of rave, .... I will be out of town 
thankfully. They wanted to know where "the internet group we used was"
I told them  I didn't want to be the one to tell them and they said they have an 
internet team!? the girl allison is going to her first rave next week....
I believe this may be the start of a continued interest in S.F. rave stuff for 
them.

some report it as agony or depression.  perhaps that is why knowing
exactly who one is is not more popular.  (my deskside dictionary gives
the primary definition of "care" as "mental distress and grief";
"attention or solicitude" is only the 2ndary definition...)  confronted
with this knowledge, one is faced with the choice to accept or deny.
typically the latter is humanly easiest.

Hi everyone!

I'll be at beautiful ppl tonight and would like to meet as many sfravers as 
possible.  So if you see a tall guy (6'3") with short black hair come up and say
hi!  If it's not me, they'll appreciate it anyway!

See you all there!

Peace

Oh, my name is pronounced whore-hay  ;)

Personally I think that MTV should be banned from the SF rave scene.  I view
them as the Evil Empire of music, youth and freedom.

Having done the herbal E thing I was most disappointed. However I

        You should try moving to montreal where i am! :) Hopefully not for
long though....There really IS a chemical 'problem' that people go through
during the winter and it's tied in with wanting to 'hibernate' plus lack of
daylight. From what i've read), sunlight directly causes the pineal gland
to _stop_ the release of a hormone, melatonin, which affects mood and
supposedly retards sexual activity. (!) (thus when spring comes, the sun
follows, so do the hormones, thus spring fever..)  Then again i read this
in one of those time-life books...

KILL YOUR TELEVISION.

I'd hate to see what happens when MTV gets a hold of the rave seen like
they did to the Seattle Grung Seen. Mabye they will even write a movie
about it?

They could call it "SINGLE: Part II. TECHNO-MURDER"

NOT


Andrew does not want the corruption of MTV to see the brain of SOUNDGOD

Hello everyone!,
	This is Greg, (so you know who's writing this!) First I have to 
say thank you to all the people who came out last night. You guys were 
beautiful people! I can't even count the number of times my body went 
numb because of the vibe! All of us with Beautiful People were very, 
very happy to see everyone having such a great time! We also have to 
thank the dj's for a night of intense, beautiful music!!!! They were all 
so good!!! And thanx to the crowd, for letting them take you to higher 
levels!! I still can't get over the vibe last night!!!!!!! Special thanx 
to Randy for a beautiful chill/ambient room!! And the next special thanx 
goes to Michael Clay, for the wonderful visuals!! :)
	We put soooo much time into that party, and if you were there 
you could probably figure out why, and for what! It took us two whole 
days of busting ass, to set up that party! And it was well worth it!!! 
Also, we wanted to thank you guys for not destroying the location. We 
didn't see one tag! However I did spend the entire morning scraping gum, 
and stickers off the floor! But I didn't really mind, I was on 
afterglow!!!!! 
	We want to apologize for the over-crowding! What happened was 
that we reached a certain capacity, and then didn't let anyone else in. 
But some dishonest people broke into the party, via a different room, 
and entered the party without us counting them. So we had about 50-75 
people that got in after we stopped letting anyone in. That is why it 
was overcrowded! 
	Then we ended up with a line of I think around 150 people, that 
dispite our encouragement to go home, wanted to wait in line to get in! 
So, what were we supposed to do? The party was packed, 150 people 
outside waiting to get in, and people sneaking in some other way. Gee, 
talk about crowd control! So, for the line we let one person in every 
time one person would leave. And because they had to wait forever to get 
in, we cut the price of admission down to $5, (not $10.) So everyone was 
happy, and that is what matters!!!!! So, sorry about the wait, and we 
hope that everyone had the best time in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	In total, to everyone who came down for Beautiful People, you 
people were soooooo beautiful!!!!! Thanx!!!!! We'll see you soon!!!
	In fact, we are doing a party with MESS and Cloud Factory. That 
is this Sat., free and outdoors!!!! See you there!!!

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people!!!!!

Greg


We love you!!!

Hello all,

Me and my friends had a great time at Beautiful people.  The music was 
intense and the atmospehere was very positive.  I really liked the 
visuals.  Did anyone catch the Indiana Jones part?  What a trip!  He 
was my childhood hero.  That brought me back to when Raiders of the 
Lost Ark first came out.  I can still remember standing on line with my 
dad to see that movie.  A funny thing to be thinking about while 
tripping on LSD and dancing to trance.

love chris

it is very simple...mtv can't profit anymore on grunge cuz kurt cobian 
has been dead for over a year...so they are slowly wondering who are all 
these geeks who have been dancing to techno for years...and gee wonder if 
we can mass market/suck every cent out of those ravers....ahahhahahah

Hi all, I've been thinking: all you DJ's out there, has anyone ever thought of
mixing together rock records with a danceable beat? I think it'd be sooo cool
if someone were to take advantage of all those beautiful guitar licks, vocals,
and drumbeats that are out there on vinyl... not that I'm not already a techno 
and house fan already--the music's great--but I just wonder if anyone had ever
or does mix in non-dance records...actually, perhaps I'm just being naive, and
it goes on all the time...hmmm let me know if I'm on target here.  I'm sort of
thinking along the lines of what U2 did recently, when they let DJs remix
songs from Achtung Baby...
Love to you all (extra doses to all the great vibers at Beautiful People!)

Hello,

Well my 286 won't run Windows '95 :-) , so I'm finally going to dig into my
credit card for a new PC.

Any advice or recommendations?

(I'm a 5 hour drive from the Bay Area, so I'll be buying by mail order...)

I'm looking for thoughts along the line of, oh, " DRAM sucks, get VRAM
instead ".  :-)

It looks like I will get a Pentium-75 (a recent Pentium chip that uses a
little slower I/O that allows the manufacturers to use cheaper I/O
devices...), it's at a good performance/price point.

Thanks!

While hanging out with  some friends at the beach after a rave a 
discussion of peterpan and raving came up.
We thought peterpan was pretty trippy and thought he was pretty ravey, by 
how he encouraged others to have happy thoughts so they can fly.  Also, 
thought it was pretty cool the way he never got older (excluding that 
hook movie).  
Anybody out there feel like they are flying when your raving, and I don't 
really mean physically although if you have experienced this, it would be 
interesting to hear.  Also wondering if others feel that raving keeps you 
from getting older (captain crunch).  Once again this doesn't 
neccessarily mean physically.
This also led to a discussion on raving in the future with the 
possibility of raving in an anti-gravity room.  I thought it would be 
great for ambient music, wasn't so sure about the rest.

Alien Factory LIVE - MDMA-2
---------------------------

WOW!!  The promoters actually came through,  and I picked up the tickets
to MDMA-2.   The tickets are something to behold.   They are laminated
Mag stripe cards like ATM cards with the Alien Factory promotion artwork
on the card.    Cost of the ticket was $54 from Central records.

So,   as Sat evening approacheth,   I get word that this one was going
to be way out of the city which was a 2 hour train ride to Richmond
(Not California).

We arrive at the train station only to learn that it's going to be a
2 KM walk to the rave.

Long before we saw it,  we heard it...   "Happy Hardcore" was booming
into the cloudy night.

The line was short,  and got in very quickly.   As we approached
security they were keeping the tickets - BUMMER!!   What a great
souvenir they would make.

This place was HUGE...   No estimate of the number of people that showed
up,   but I estimate about 7000 people.   There was no chill room to
speak of,  but the people doing the lasers let us keep our stuff
backstage.

About 15 minutes later,   Alien Factory were starting up,  and played
some of the most wicked sick trance I've heard in a long time.

I was somewhat disappointed that their set was only 45 minutes long,
but what they DID okay was really great.

After  Alien Factory's set,   Paul Holden took to the turn tables and
laid down some incredible Happy Hardcore

I went off BIG TIME,  dispite that I also went out to Energy on Friday
evening as well....   I saw MANY people there who said they saw me at
"The happiest people...",  and "Smerf Village".

At one point,  I was dancing so hard literally trancing out,  that one
girl pulled me up on the stage to dance with the group.    Holy shit!!
The view from the stage,  mixed with the lasers made for some of the
most unforgettable visuals I'll experience in a long time.   To look out
there at the thousands of smiling faces was something to behold.

The energy at this rave was like nothing I've ever seen.   Here I was,
at Sydney's BIGGEST RAVE of the year,   literally going insane....

As usual,   the same happy hardcore songs were played.   I swear,  there
aren't that many Happy Hardcore songs out there,   I keep hearing them
over and over....

A little later on,   I went out to get some water,   and when I pulled
out my money to check if I had enough,   one of the security guards led
me away from the group and demanded that I show them the contents of my
wallet.   I asked what they were looking for,   but they said I had a
"baggie" - I convinced them that they were wrong.

Back to dancing...  As I returned,   people walked up to me,  shaking my
hand,  saying they have never seen anyone so old "Get off" like I was
doing.   They would say...  You're fuckin SICK!!!   As I approached the
front,   people led me up to the stage,  where there were about 3 or 4
people dancing.    Even the security guards were smiling and looking at
me dancing up there.... A couple of girls grabbed my hands and we danced
around up there on the stage like there was no tommorrow.   Even the
sound crew joined in,   as well as a few security guards..   It was
simply incredible...

The lasers,  mixed in with the smoke machines,   made for some eye
popping visual.

As dawn approached,  the crowd still stayed the same....   energy level
somewhat increased at this point.   But as late morning approached,
people were leaving,   and the last DJ spun some housey trancey stuff.
he DJ (Mr. Groove) was from the UK.

It eventually ended,  and we made it to the train station OK,   and
headed back into town....

This was the BIGGEST rave I've ever been to in my life...   What a way
to end my Australian trip..

I leave for the Bay Area on Monday,  and as I'm typing this up now,
before I leave for the USA,  I want to get in this report.    I also
went to recovery,  danced until about 2 am.

I eventually got home,   typed in this report and got it up there to
the net....

Cheers

Thank you to all you wonderful people for joining me at Liquid Groove. I
had a glorious time talkning to people and dancing with everyone.
Because I was responsible for sound I had to be very sober. Thank god I
was because the power went out twice. But being quick on my feet and
having the awsome SIMON as the dj, recovery was quick and smooth.

If anyone ever has the chance to talk to DUTCH at a party. Do so. He's
been in a real good mood lately and is looking very healthy.

All the DJ's just PHUCKED IT UP last night.

Great music from KEN, SCOTT, DUTCH, SIMON, and KARISMA my budddy. I hope
to see all of you at COME-UNITY. I can't miss SIMON and MARKIE in one
night at such a great place.

Well I just finished breaking down. I haven't slept for 39 hours but
It's such a georgeous day I'm thinking about going out and flying my
kite here at the river here in sac.

LOVE TO ALL  :() Andrew----------------------------------SOUNDGOD@iccse.com

P.S.: Hey MARY, Just hold the balloon about 2 feet from the bottom
speaker with your fingertips, very lightly. DID YOU LIKE IT?

Although my stay at Wicked was brief, I'd have to say the  beat, visuals and
general mood on the floor was some of the vest vibes I've had in a while. 
I went out with a few friends (1st. timers) and since Antioch was a tad out
of the way Wicked seemed to be the next best thing...
I learned never take 1st time ravers to a 21 and up rave. 
Maybe it's just me, I've been in the scene since late 92' and I guess the
term Rave has a whole different meaning to the new generation.  While I was
grooving on the sound and vibes (I was the one in all black & the Cuban
Gaints B-ball cap) they seemed to be interested in the people & things around
them... 
        But I had a G-r-r-r-r-eat time...

Smile o meter:

      Hugs:  (plenty O this a time)                9Smiles
    Vibes:  (never slowed a beat)                 8Smiles
    Space: (A tad bit croweded at times)     6Smiles
PLUR factor: (i've seen a lot more at other raves)
                      6.5Smiles

Overall: a sound 7.  Good tunes, good fun, pretty decent trip too
=)

Adam.

Will there be anyone spinning in the parking lot tonite?
Inquiring minds who wish to dance would like to know.

Markie's set at Wicked last night brought tears to my eyes.
It is so good to be home.

My old roommate dj Rigatony sometimes mixes some old Led Zepplin tunes with
house music.  He says it's a little difficult because the timing on rock
tunes isn't perfect like computer generated house music.  It sounded really
cool though.  I've also heard him spinning ambient and using two copies of
"Riders on the Storm" (I think that the name of it) by the Doors, and having
them perfectly sinked up, except for one is just barly slower than the
other.  He uses his finger to push the slower one til it's even with the
other then lets it slowly fall back.  The effect is a totally trippy flange
sound that is produced although the sound is not in ethier record.  I'm sure
my description doesn't do much to really describe the amazing sound this
technique produces, but I know atleast the dj's know what I'm talking about.
If I'm not clear enough, ask a dj to show you sometime.  Later.

Rick

Speaking of ambient music, peter pan, anti-gravity and what not, I spin
ambient, which is somtimes (not just including my music) known to make
people fly in thier minds, and I just got a copy of a peterpan record
complete with story book and pictures to incorporate with my sets.

This is a great way to meet SFRavers in a frendly informal way.
You don't have to worry about the "sordid rave underworld(tm)", drugs
or anything else that might make your boss or parents upset.

It's especially good for those of us who work in "the valley" to
have a chance to get together during the week.

I'm going to try my best to make it Larry.

Larry is a very kool person

I went to Wicked.

In fact if some of you did go you might have seen me.
I was the "door diva" from 11:30 to about 3:30

(For those of you who don't know, the door diva does the "guest list"
as in who is on and who is not :)

This was the first Wicked back at King Street after a long hiatus.
It seemed to me that the security was a lot mellower, they seem to remember
me from "the bad old days" (The crew had a major confrontation with this
security team in the DJ booth at Townsend about a year ago that almost came
to blows) The head guys said something to me like "It's been a long time" I 
said "Yeah, long enough to forget the past and start a fresh".  Suffice it to
say that we had a rather good party which was more or less uneventful.  
I'm sure some people who did not have proper ID were turned away but it is a
fact of like that you have to have _some_ form of ID to go to clubs in San
Francisco,  this is not true of undergrounds or renegades and there eill be
plenty of them this summer as well.

Anyway, I must say that this Wicked was definitely heading back in the
direction that the parties should be going, lots of smiles, lots of
freaky people, lots of good music and a good amount of Vibe, although
this is generally a function of the attendees so we do need to work on that.
The DJ line-up was 

		Chaulky-	He played some really good stuff, I enjoyed
				his set, still I would like to see him
				in a slot other than opening which is
				a hard slot to fill, still he got the job done
				which was to get the crowd moving.

		Spun-		Jason play a good moving set but didn't seem
				to get into the groove that I know he's capable
				of.  I was working a lot during this time so
				I didn't get to hear most of it.

		Markie-		The man of the hour for this party, he got the
				crowd moving and the Vibe flowing, It was nice
				to experience the Trade Marked Wicked Locomotive
				The type of set that urges you to "get on board"
				This train is headed "out".  And Markie, the
				engineer at the helm drove us in a good way.  
				It felt good.

		Emma-		The first time I ever heard her.  She's an
				excellent DJ, though she doesn't seem to have
				mixing abilities that we are use too at a wicked
				still this might have been an off night but
				the Music that she did play as FULL ON!  She 
				worked the crown and continued where markie
				left off.



All in all I believe this is a step in the right direction for Wicked as
a whole.  The next party will be July 8, hopefully summer will be in full
effect here :)

Larry C is one of the most vibest person's I know.  A major part of having a
good party is the energy of the people that come, when I go to a party and
see Larry there, I know it's gonna be a good party because Larry's energy
is sooo good, I don't see him often any more, neither he nor I go out
as much as we used too :)  (Well, maybe he doesn't go out that much :)
But I can tell you that Larry puts into action in his everyday life, what
some of us believe to be the essence of what it is to be a raver.

Just a short note to say thank you to all those that put on Beautiful People.  The Dj's had me dancing longer than I had for a LONG LONG time.  And the Vibe..
people were SO friendly.  Met all sorts of wonderful people :)  My only  complaint, and it isn't much of one, is that the chill room didn't have pillows or anything comfortable to sit on except for the cold hard ground.

Went to Wicked on Saturday night.  Haven't been to a Wicked in a LONG time because of some unpleasant experiences that I had had.  Well, deciding to give Wicked a second chance was the best decision i could have made.  The music was going off!  I loved the intimate space.  The visuals had my brain reeling.  But by far, what made this party for me were the people.  I couldn't tell you how many times ppl just came up, sat down and started talking to me.  How many smiles ppl gave me.  By the time i left the party (~7am) I was on a natural high.  I went to sleep with a smile and woke up with a smile.  Thanks to all those who made it a wonderful night (Bruce, Kimberly, Allison, Christina, Amy, etc.) and thanks to the Wicked crew.  I WILL be at your next party :)

Peace - Love - Unity - Respect
They are more than just words

I was there with a friend last Friday & had a -great- time.  We
showed up a little early (11:30 or so) and all that was open at the
time was the front room, so we hung out until the music started in
the middle room & basement.  The basement was frantic -- I pulled a
lot of energy from the people in that room.

Then we headed upstairs to the middle room (sorry, I don't know their
proper names :-) ) and I hit on a natural high just dancing around.
It was several hours later when I finally took a break & walked
around a bit -- my clothes looked like I had been hit by a water
cannon :-)

One minor nit to pick..

This did not work -at all-.  They had no idea what I was talking
about.  If this is supposed to work, someone needs to educate the
door staff (or just put SFRaves on the paper guest list).  They
said it was a "nice try".  :-)

It was only my 3rd time ever to 1015 and already I recognize a number
of faces from previous weeks.  I didn't meet any SFRavers (that I
know of) but hope to bump into people next time.  If you see me
there, come say 'hi'.  [A picture is in my home page so you can
recognize me :-) ]

Kudos to AJ, Kevin, Brian, and the guy doing the visuals, they were
COOL.  Also the unnamed asian-woman-in-black-atop-the-amp whose
energy kept me going for hours..

Until next week,
Allan

I get 89.7 (KFJC, Los Altos Hills CA, Foothill Jr College) in Glen Park
(well, actually Sunnyside, which is near Glen Park). The farther south
you go in the city, the better the reception is. Basically, you have
to get away from KPOO (89.5, SF??) in order to get KFJC.

Also, I have a better than average preamp/tuner and I also have
amplified antenna. This may have something to do with my ability to
hear KFJC in SF; sometimes I can only get it in mono. Other times
I have to use the high-frequency blend button to get it in stereo
w/o too much noise....

And no, I can't promise that I'll be around on fri evening from 10-2

I don't know the telephone number for KFJC, but they are on the internet.
They are at: "http://www.cygnus.com/misc/kfjc.html"  It is a pretty good
site, but it does need some help, and some updating once in a while.  Just
thought you might want to take a look.

I gotta say that Beautiful People was one of the absolute best times I've 
had in a long time now.  the vibe was at an incredible all time high.  I 
can't even remember the last time I saw so many happy people.  I guess 
the smile policy was strongly enforced at the door.  Although by the time 
I got there I had missed DRC's set, I saw the end of Graeme and he played 
some pretty cool fast acid stuff.  Then Trent came on and just blew 
everyone away.  An amazing set.The records were all so completely tweaky 
with some of the strangest and trippiest shit.  Lots of times the muzik 
slowed a bit to give people a chance to space out abit before completely 
going mental.  I hads such a good time on the dance floor that i never 
did get to experience the chill rooms.  great party!!

HAPPINESS IS BEING AMONG FRIENDS      |\__/,|   (`\

I checked out scambled on sunday for a little while.  Never been to that 
111 mina st location.  I really enjoyed it.  Nice hardwood dancefloor, 
pretty decent sound system, good music, friendly vibe.  
Could use a few more people, so if anyone is up for dancing during the 
day on sunday, check it out.  I was only there for about 2 hours, as I 
was still in recuperation mode, and felt the need to enjoy some of the 
beautiful weather outside.  There were only about 15-20 people while I 
was there.  Most were dancing, which was pretty cool and made it seem 
like more.  
I do sometimes miss those boogy buffet partys.  With sunsets soon to be 
every week, nothing will be missed.  Its nice to have some alternatives, 
if the weather is crappy and sunset gets cancelled.
Of course it doesn't compare to sunset (imo), but still nice to have if I 
get a sudden dance crave on a sunday during the day.  Thought I might 
have heard someone say, it went on sat morning as well.

That's easy.  Look at who OWNS the TV networks.

Around the time that GE bought RCA (including NBC), there was an interview
somehwhere
in which the the head of GE came out and said he was buying the network so
he could dictate
its editorial policies.  I'm sure the others are the same (though it's
unusual to see them come
right out and admit it like that).

Hey Allan,

I was there somewhere.  Blond chinese guy.  The vibe really picked up 
around 5 am don't you think?  The basement was phat.  I couldn't decide 
which I liked better; steamy subterranean groove downstairs or spacious 
booming monster bleeps upstairs.  Decisions, decisions.

I got there at midnight or so and stepped to the guest list line and got 
in no problem. The girl looked for a page for SFRaves, but then asked me 
my address and wrote it in the margin somewhere. Maybe after your 
incident she asked someone and got informed.  I felt like a big.time.star 
for slipping by all the clubbers chewing their gum and wearing those 
jeans which fit like they were made to do just that.

See you next time!

I also had an excellent time at 1015 on Friday night, caught the end of
Spun's set and then Tracy's excellent late one.  Lotsa great trax,
excellent sound, not crowded but grooving crowd.  Haven't felt that
relaxed-but-up feeling in a club for a while!

Sorry everybody for not responding to all your messages for a while.  
Between raving my butt off, finals next week, huge projects due this 
week, and getting incredibly sick, I have been really busy.  I am sure 
you don't want to hear about my problems so I will dicsuss some other 
stuff now....tee hee!

Well, a good day for Glade (or Mile High) looks like July 31 weekend.  
Yup, 3 nights of fun.  Things are starting to come together but I have 
sorta put everything off until after finals.   I thought for a minute 
about Sep 23 (I think that was the weekend) because of the Autumn 
Solstice but people will be back in school so it would prolly be better 
to have it during the summer.

I will be at Moontribe (hopefully), but I will not be able to stay the 
entire time because I have a final on Tues. at 11:00.  

Also who else is going to the June 15th Orb show?  I hope to see you all
there.  

This poor tired kid needs his rest now, I will try to respond to the mail 
you guys sent me ASAP.  But I promise nothing.  Catchya later.

Yeah I tend to agree as well.  I think big name DJ are good for their 
thing as well tho.  I would like to get a few semi-well known DJs and 
some really great and enthusiastic unknowns (or semi-knowns).  Hopefully 
we could find a peacefull mix.

Now now...don't give me any ideas...j/k

I would never do a thing like that....8=] (evil grin).

No really I am just kidding...I think it is really cool that people are 
comfortable enuff with this list to give out their numbers.  Besides you 
guys all have my number (I posted it a gajillion times) so you could 
always do the same to me.  

Catch ya later...until the bass pumps in the forrest...

hey all!

well, i haven't posted for a while, so here goes, a bit of a summary of 
parties and rave-related-in-the-broad-sense-only tidbits:

went to dust last friday.  still at the loading dock, tho' i hear they're 
moving soon.  yeah, the loading dock lounge itself doesn't do all that 
much for me (too gray), but i like the cushy dance floor (sure beats the 
cement i'm used to!) and the booths.. the space isn't bad for a friday 
night mellow party.  alex spun last friday and played an excellent set, 
but unfortunately he may have blown some speakers :( ..  it was really 
good to dance..i'd been pretty depressed (more later) and unmotivated, and 
dancing really got some creative juices flowing... i may be 
there friday, and i have shortish green hair, so if you see me, say hi...

weekend before i went to Carnival in the mission, and got some grand 
ideas in my head about a rave/dj float next year...would be fun as hell 
and hopefully easy to do!  (just hope they don't have some regulations 
about having to dance in formation!)  i figure it's really appropriate 
cuz it's a celebration of int'l musick and dance after all...
favorite part of Carnival: at the end of the Wise Fool contingent, there 
was a clown dresseed in a suit, i think, with a stick attached to his 
head, and at the end of the stick was a dollar bill, and as he kep moving 
forward reaching for the dollar, he dragged the earth (half-deflated) 
behind him in a dump truck...

so as i said i've been depressed lately, part of it  related to the fact 
that the death warrant was signed for Mumia Abu Jamal, a radical 
AFrican-Amer. activist and reporter in philadelphia who was framed for 
the death of a police officer.  he's been on death row for years, did not 
have a fair trial, and is now scheduled to be put to death and it's just 
reminding me more and more about the power of racism and the state in 
quashing dissent.  so, if anyone's interested or can make it, there's a 
rally/press conf. for mumia friday, june 9 at 4:30 at the federal bldg. 
in sf.

well, take care everyone,
with love and @,
monicat

 I found that phone number for Capt. Crunch/John Draper that I had
asked you folks for recently. My old NETCOM mail had gotten out
of sequence for some reason , and his original mail message to me
wasn't where I thought they'd be.

Not sure how many of you will be interested in this, but I feel like 
sharing it(if nothing else it should make you happier to be in SF)...

I went back to Cleveland to visit some friends and family, thinking that 
we'd go out dancing and I'd get to hear some of that hardcore and 
breakbeat that I loved so much from my undergrad days. We decided to head 
down to "The Flats" on Fri. to find a good club, and to make a long story 
short, it just plain sucked. For starters, the only club playing anything 
approaching dance music had about three people in it, including the 
doorman. Besides that and the over-abundance of drunk jock-wannabes, the 
city decided that it made sense to rip out all of the streets at once and 
cause major headaches and tensions. Ended up going home without dancing 
(heard about a hip-hop underground party too far away to go to though)

Decided to wait until "The church" on Sunday to try again. This used to 
be the greatest bastion for dancing in Cleveland (besides the few 
underground clubs that lasted about a month each). My friends and I were 
determined to have a good time, so we started dancing as soon as we got 
there. (Un?)fortunately, we were the only ones on the huge floor, so we 
got to be divas for a while (I think it's even funnier when you look 
completely normal:-) When they finally turned up the volume at midnight, 
the jocks got on the floor, along with those of us actually trying to 
dance and have fun. The music was good, but they tried WAY too much to 
mix it up: house straight into breakbeat into some weird gabber/jungle, 
back into house, etc. It ended up sounding very choppy and wore me out 
too quickly. The good part of the club was the back room, where they had 
a cool little house/acid jazz thing going. spent most of the rest of our 
time their, but the volume was overwhelming and we left early.

Overall, I think i may just have expected too much and may just be 
wasting your bandwidth, so I'll go now.

Love,
Derek (who may actually be able to go out this summer!)

I don't know I think we should avoid grassy knolls. Might get accused of

i've noticed a lot of msgs about tix for sale for BFD, so I'm wondering
if anybody  else is going (either that or you've all decided it's gonna
suck and are selling your tix)... anyways perhaps there should be an
SFR meet-up zone at BFD? I'll be at 8th row center in the seating area
in case anybody cares.

IMHO this is _very_ rave related considering what has happened
in other countries around the issues of "repetative beats", 
It has become aparent that a "culture" can be outlawed in realspace
not to mention Cyberspace also consider the current hoop-la over 
"gangsta rap", how long before "drug music" like techo/rave
is banned from the Internet by people who think it promotes sex and drug orgies.
If this bill passes with the communications decency act tacked on, it could
come to that, seriously Fax, call or write your Senator TODAY.
If just 10% of the people on all of the rave e-mail list around the country
called their senators I assure you it WOULD make a difference, 10% of sfraves
is over 40 people, better yet Fax and call, each fax is suppose to count
for at lease 100 people who have the same opinion.


						Just Do it.

THE LATEST NEWS

The Senate is ready to act on the Telecommunications Reform Bill this
week, perhaps as soon as Wednesday, June 7th.  We had thought the
Counter Terrorism bill would take all week, but the Senate changed its
schedule without consulting us. :-)

(We sincerely apologize for issuing another alert on the heels of the
prior one, but the Senate's readiness to move on this legislation was
not anticipated.  We'll watch out for such a situation again and avoid
releasing two alerts to close together in the future. We also apologize
for the length of this Alert, but it contains the entire Senate contact
info.)

Note that there are few people who don't know about the bill.  However
if you are unfamiliar with the bill, take a moment to retrieve the
materials listed in the "For More Information" section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW -- U.S. and non-U.S. citizens

The Telecomm Reform Bill, will, in all likelihood, include either the
Exon Amendment (formerly the Communications Decency Act) or the Leahy
Amendment. It is essential that the Leahy language be substituted for
Exon's, and therefore it is essential:

1. That all citizens call or fax their Senators as soon as possible.
   There is no time for written letters and email is too easily
   discounted or ignored. Non-U.S. citizens should contact Vice
   President Gore.  Note, if you decide to send a fax, you'll want to
   write an expanded version of the statement below.

   It's very important that you always be cool, collected, and polite.

   U.S. citizens:

	<call your Senators' offices, contact info below>
	"Hello, Senator ________'s office"
	"Hi, I'm a constituent and would like to register my
	 opinion on the Telecommunications Reform bill to the 		
	 Senator."
	"Hold On please.  Alright, go ahead."
	"Please vote to remove the Communications Decency Act provision
         (Title 4 of S652) from the Telecomm Reform bill and 
	 replace it with the Leahy alternative (S714).  My name and 
	 address is ________."
	"Thanks for calling." 
	<click>

   Non-U.S. citizens:
	<call, fax, or send email to Vice President Gore>
	"Dear Vice President Gore,

	 The world looks to the United States as one leader in 
	 developing a Global Information Infrastructure.  Title 4 of
	 the Telecomm Reform bill (the Communications Decency Act)
     	 imperils that leadership.  Please work to remove it from the
	 Telecomm Reform bill (S652) and replace it with Senator
 	 Leahy's sensible alternative (S714).  I'm calling from
	 ____________."


2. Send VTW a note telling us what you did. If you contacted your two
   Senators, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of
   "XX ack" where "XX" is your state.  For example:

	To: vtw@vtw.org
	Subject: OH ack

	I called my Ohio Senators and expressed my opinion.

   If you contact Senators outside your state, please let us know what
   state you're from.  

   If you contacted Vice President Gore, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with
   a subject line of "gore ack".  For example:

	To: vtw@vtw.org
	Subject: gore ack

	I called VP Gore and expressed my opinion.  I'm from France.

   An automatic responder will return an updated contact tally.

3. Forward this Alert to relevant forums on other online services and
   BBS's.  Check the letter you get back to see which Senators are
   underrepresented by citizen contacts. Forward the Alert to any
   friends and colleagues in those states.

4. If you haven't yet signed the petition to support Sen. Leahy,
   do so now.  Send mail to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of
   "send petition" for directions.

5. Congratulate yourself!  Your two-minute activism joins that of many
   thousands of others over the past two months.

     Dear all:
     
     Due to various movements (in and out of state) onwards, forwards and 
     so on, this Friday, June 9th will be the last weekly dust.  It will be 
     at the same place (loading dock), same time (10 - 3) and I hope that 
     you will join us.  Once again, a big thank you to all those who have 
     supported us through cyberspace, in person, in thought.  Doing this 
     has been an extremely gratifying experience for all of us.
     
     This week we will have Jonah Sharp (Spacetime Continuum), Lewis 
     (Vertigo) and our resident John Carel spinning.
     
     We hope to bring you other dust related events in the future, but for 
     now, Dj Minor will be joining forces with Philip (from 8th House) to 
     start a new venture -- look out for it, it will be happening soon.  
     Gateway Systems i.e. John Carel & Dave Abel, will be teaming up with 
     Clare Korich to bring you a series of summer parties entitled "Light." 
      And myself, I will be going to law school, probably on the East 
     Coast.
     
     So come down and wish us luck!  It has been great communicating with 
     all of you.  Have a great summer.
     
     (apologies for the use of bandwidth)
     
     Saira

Well I just heard it on the news boys and girls...it's snowing in the 
tahoe forrest down to the 4000' elevation mark.  UGHHH!!!!  The site is 
ALL the way up at 6000 feet.  I guess that means 6-7' snow drifts.   
Hmmm.  I still think the weekend of July 28-30 is still very doable tho.  
The snow should be melted and it will be warmer however it won't be too 
dry from the new growth yet.  How does that work for all you guys?  
September could still work but I think that it is too late in the 
season.  People will be back in school and it will be much drier up 
there.  However if all you people think you could make it for the Sept 22-24 
date (Autumn Solstice) then please tell me...if school is not a problem 
(or work) then please let me now, that way I still know it is a viable 
option.  Thanks alot and I hope to hear from you all soon.

	-Christian

I'm looking forward to Come/Unity tonite & even hope to meet some
SFravers there.  Ambitious, I know.  But my question:  what is the
music?  I am too new to the scene to know the DJ's styles "by name".

We were at Cat's Grill for Acid Jazz on Monday Night, and it was a
good time -- we arrived at 12:00 and stayed until ~3:30.  Had a few
drinks, hung out, danced, etc.  The music was sort of a bummer though
-- I had a hard time picking out any variety.  I'm used to that style
being the slow stuff they play to give everyone a breather..  :-)

But for tonight -- if you're at 1015 and see a 6' tall white guy,
glasses, dark curly hair, wearing lots of black, dancing around with
a long-haired redhead, come say hi.  :-)  [even if it's not us
they'll appreciate it]

Also, for some pre-dance pizza eats we're going to the 20 Tank
Brewery on 11th.  Should be a good night.

Generally CU are pretty much House music as in progressive, some acid
some trance, it tends to be very dancable and fun, getting trancy near
the end.

Usually CUs are "repetative beats" type of music where one DJ rollls 
into the other.

Hey all,

Looks like we got us a posse of SFRavers at 1015 tonight! Must be summer 
(or is everyone calling in sick? ;)

Since the weather has been so nice, I was thinking of getting a few souls 
together, watch the sun come up, then do breakfast. 

The place is called Corona Heights, off Roosevelt (by castro and 14th), 
and near the Randall Museum. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Diablo, the 
southbay, everything!

If you're up for it, swing by and we'll share the view.

Jonas

With all this energy tonight, we gonna blow the roof off 1015!

> Cat's Grill for Acid Jazz on Monday Night
> The music was sort of a bummer though

I like mushroom jazz.  Seems like a different crowd
everytime I go.  I agree, the music has been very "popular"
acid jazz the last few times I've gone.  Compared to the triphop
at black diamond it is completely boring.  (triphop is a new
name for acid jazz, in my mind, and this name game is 
getting So ridiculous)  Anyway, it does seem to
keep everyone happy and it is, what you might 
call, a very _friendly_ place.

I'd say CU plays House.  I've heard a fair variation of
music falling under that general description at the other CU
parties I've been to.  They don't slow it down just because
it is midweek.  My impression, also, is that this party
is on the club kid hotsheet ... "CU tonight? let's
go find us some Cute Ravers!!"

Variety is nice, no?
Dave

Ephedrine a the derivative of the ephedra (Ma Huang/Ephedra Equisetina) 
plant.  Its chemical structure looks like this (excuse my horrible ascii 
graphics):

        _____     OH
       / --- \    |  
      < \   / >---CH-CH-NH-CH3
       \_____/       |
                     CH3
                  
2-methylamino-1-phenyl-1-propanol (ephedrine)

(note it looks chemically similar to methamphetamine, which lacks the -OH)

Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (sudafed, suphedrine) is the hydrochloride 
salt of pseudoephedrine and has the same formula as ephedrine, but it is
a different enantiomer (the arrangement of the chemical bonds is slightly
different, making it the d-form of the chemical), and it reacts differently 
in your body.

The Merck index lists l-ephedrine as a bronchodilator and d-pseudoephedrine
as a decongestant.  Ephedrine and ma huang are often used as stimulants,
as well.

I hope that answers your question.  :)

I think Jonas's idea about munching down breakfast with sfravers after
come/unity is super cool... Jonas if you're out there, or anyone else, what
time do you want to meet?  Outside after the party ends? Sorry to be kinda
anal retentive; I jkust don't know any of yer faces so I won't be sure where
to look!  Also, anyone know what time come/unity should end?  I think last time
it was around 4:30?  ANyway, everybody have a great time: come on, lotsa
cheering and thick thick vibes :) :) :)!!!!!!
everybody eat breakfast afterwards too!  Rave rave rave!

christian,
i think the 28th (in terms of timing) and with snow permitting would be
better - at least here in the bay area, a lot of people are planning to make
the trek to the burning man thing over labor day weekend, so . ..
in terms of spacing out of town journees for bay area folks i think that the
28th would be better - we are willing to show up for either date!

crunchman!
we are doing a renegade on mt. tam friday nite, playing a lot of
"happy hardcore techno cyber trance" - not for the faint of heart
we could bring a tape deck and play some of your tapes if you think that
would work - we'll be playing off of regular 1200's and cd players as
well - what do you think?

Thank you everyone for a wonderful night at Come-Unity.
I got there at 11:00, stayed till the end, crossed back across
the Bay Bridge for a lovely *early* breakfast at Dave's diner
(I had the "Nutty Buck" cakes; try and say that fast). Home for a
shower, and now I'm at work - but the music's still in my
head, and I'm still raving, thinking...

Just when I thought I "understood" raves; when I feared they
could no longer surprise me - we take off last night with such
energy and grace.  Making me feel so strangely alive, like my
first time raving, but *not* the first time - somehow capturing
time in a loop, and letting me begin again!

I was helping chaperone two "acquaintances" (now friends)
who had never been to a rave, never done X (I still call it that, as
it sounds so deliciously sinister, an *always unknown* variable)...
I was so excited for them, so thrilled at their delight - I forgot to
worry about myself, forgot to implicate myself in my usual litanies
of hesitance and insecurity.

I forgot my usual expectations, and remembered how to BE.
Or, re-learned, maybe, no matter the forgetting.  It is such
freedom to be both brave and tender.  I am still tingling!

Thank you for letting me feel confident.  Thank you for letting
me move amongst you, and dance, and watch you dancing, and smile,
and look into your eyes, and touch your sweaty, glistening shoulders
with my fingertips!

I feel glorious and strong, and powerful, and grateful.

ComeUnity! Once the rave of the "devoted" hardcore (people who didn't have
jobs the next day or didn't care that they had jobs :) has now become
mainstream.  I arrived at 3:30 expecting to see things thinned out a bit,
I didn't expect a line half-way around the block.  Sometimes club-courtesy
comes in handy :) Any way the place was Choc-O--Bloc Packed with people.
The Vibe was heavy and even though I saw many a new face mixed with the old,
many received first lessons and from the look of it learned them well.

I missed everyones set but Markie but he was  "doin it" when I got there
and continued for the rest of the morning, This was one of those parties where
I can completely straight but got that contact E buzz, complete with the
fire up my spine, blurry vision , the works, I love when this happens, I just
goes to show you, it's not how much drugs you injest it's how much vibe is
generated.  Many shouts out to all that I saw.



P.S.  Poppy, if your out there please give me a call I have
a question to ask you.

I've never waited so long to get into Come-Unity; maybe I oughta stop
listing it ;).  Worth the wait for a great set by Markie and a jumpin'
crowd.  Lotsa free and cheap (and some outdoor) parties this weekend -
Frequency 8, sol y luna, Cloud Factory et al.  Hope no rain is forecast...
Friday also has a bunch of reasonably-priced weeklies now (Dust, Bros/Sistas
if you have the invite or get on the list), Bulletproof, both Freakies). 
United has a cool flyer (check it out on the web page) but will probably
cost more than the freebies on Sat. :)...

Geoff wisely says: Once the rave of the "devoted" hardcore (people who 
didn't have jobs the next day or didn't care that they had jobs :)..

Wow! What a great happening Come/Unity. The vibe was just short of 
ecstatic. Big smiles, and great grins reaffirmed my belief that the SF 
rave scene still has what it takes!

I walked into work at 10:00am , on 2 hours sleep,... tired, but shining in 
the "warm afterglow"!

It definitely was worth it :) Blinky blinky blink!

Rave on Folks... Sy

hi y'all !  
i am an seraver (south east raves) who has found myself transplanted 
all the way across the country for the summer.  the problem is i don't
know anybody, don't know where to go, and don't know how to get there
anyway, since i don't have a car.  and it's so frustrating because i
get all these posts about all these phat parties and all, and don't know
what to do about them.  so if there are any kewl people out there who
would like to take me under their wing and show me what's going on here,
i would really, really, really, really (well, you get the point) appreciate
it :).  
i'm really nice, i promise!  
thanks,
seth

...here's some food for thought :

If there's any certain philosophy that comes from spending long periods 
of time in silence among strangers in line : or spending long periods of 
time in friction among strangers in sweat :  I've found mine to be the 
idea of Creativity and Respect.

House music/culture is an unconventional, underground ((for now)) form of 
youth culture. There's a lot of freedom and the rare oppurtanity in that 
moment to do things that wouldn't be all that welcome in other areas of a 
person's life... everyone has their own unique interpataion of the Punk 
Monk Performance Art Piece... or to put it another way, you don't necesarilly 
need a prom date to go to a rave. 

Just as a person can use whatever space he has to it's fullest, there's 
also a certain amount of respect given to the people around him for their 
own space and an etiquete involved in such matters as line-jumping, threading 
through the crowd, and finding a space to move. This is one of the 
instances where I freely give respect without waiting to have it earned. 

>From my experiences in San Francisco, I've found that quite a few of the 
regulars have similar philosophies... sometimes with a twist but almost 
always compatable.

Wednsay night found me in the company of some good friends and famaliar 
faces. For that I'm grateful. 

Wendsay night also found me at times among people who seemed to have a 
total disregard for anything or anyone except for their Fabio perm. 
Smokers on the dance floor, nappers on the stage, squatters on the stairs. 
Shoves, punches, enough Vanilla Ice attitudes for an entire MTV Spring 
Break marathon.

...at times it felt like raving with the cast of 90210.

Any debate on this medium would seem like preaching to the converted...

But like I said, it's just some food for thought.

Dear All;

	Hi all, god what a day, this past Monday I totalled my Jeep and it
was my fault with only liability. I'm now vehicless and nursing a brused
rib or two. I could really use some rides in da future as its gonna be a
little while before I have my own transporation again, but hopefully not
too long. I'm also having to move again!!!, I already have a place but
really need help, its just me a another friend witha Geo Metro, yikkes!!!.
I'm planning on moving round the 16th or the 17th on dis month, June. If
you can help, you'll get yourself a free massage once I'm better and my
eternal graditude. So please contact me through my pager/voice mail if you
are available in the day, early afternoon on either of those dates,
thanks. I'm sure we can make it a bit of a party considering I don't have
that much stuff, and nothing I own requires more than one person to lift,
thats the way I'm setup, lite and fast. Hope to see ya, please!!

Have you ever been at a rave, dancing away in the wee hours of the 
morning, and suddenly become overwhelmingly depressed and wondered why 
you're even there?
That's happened to me at every rave I've gone to for quite a while now. 
It just floors you to be so incredibly sad in the midst of so much joy.
Then, a few minutes ago, I read some of the posts from the archives on 
hyperreal.com.
I got real, genuine goosebumps from some of them, especially the posts
from people sharing their wonderful experiences. It was like the     
positive energy was shooting right out of the screen. 
 It made me remember why I like Raving. :)

Hello everyone!,

	I just wanted to tell you guys about the free combo party on sat 
June 10th. Well, Cloud Factory, Mother Earth Sound System, and Harmony / 
Beautiful People, are all combining to dance in the beginning of summer! 
It will be free, outdoors, in the South Bay, and well worth checking 
out! I am not sure, but the MESS might be supplying visuals! (I don't 
want to promise anything, but it was mentioned.) We are thinking of 
starting around 12(midnight) and going wwwwaaayyy into the morning!!! It 
should be really great!!!! So bring warm clothes, tents, lots of things 
to share, and lots of energy!!! More info will be given on the Harmony 
line (408)486.9591, BP voicemail (408)450.3044, Cloud Factory's Spam 
line (408)457-SPAM, and the MESS voicemail lines (which I happen to not 
be able to find right now so if you know them call, if not you can call 
any of the above!) 
	Well, it's going to be a lot of fun, and we hope to see all the 
friendly faces that we love!!!!

See ya there!!!,

(For everybody) Greg

Every time I step into COME-UNITY I get that same feeling. As the end of
the month comes around I feel like a salmon does at spawning season,
uncontrollably drawn to a specific destination.

That urge doesn't stop when I get there though. I keep searching inside
for the answer until I hear that snare drum rattle a thousand times a
minute in my head. I open my eyes real WIDE and see a collection of
souls. Like a collauge(SP) of spirits designed into a beatiful peice of
art. That artwork will live inside all of us, permanently showing a
naked truth about collective souls. As this ever changing world makes a
permanent impression I feel as if everyone met me without even saying
"Hi".

Milton and I got there a little past 12:30. As we entered I knew that I
wasn't goin asleep until 6:00 or so.

As I found my usual spot on the stage around 2:30 I didn't stop until
the last song.

Until next time.

This was my first ComeUnity and all I can say is WOW. I had a blast and am my
poor feet are just now recovering from the non-stop dancing. I have kind of
been avoiding larger events for the last several years but couldn't resist
after hearing all the good reviews lately. 

soundgod mentioned:
>I open my eyes real WIDE and see a collection of

>beatiful peice of art. 

All night/morning it was so nice to scan around the crowd while dancing and
visually connect with so many new people. Never exchanging any words with
most but connecting in a way that we will remember the next time we meet.

The only bummer was waiting in line for over an hour to get in. The sad thing
was it was not just the wait but the observations while waiting. I was amazed
at the number of people who had absolutely no respect for others waiting in
line. It reminded me in a BIG way why I stopped going to big clubs for
several years. You would never know it once you got inside but I agree with
 dislex@mercury.sfsu.edu who said

>Just as a person can use whatever space he has to it's fullest, there's

What's up with waiting line dynamics? Was it just that night or is this
standard fare nowadays?

People don't seem to know where the end of the line is. All night long people
would just mill up and down the line looking for friends so they could cut
in. I have no problem with saving someones space while they park or something
but come on. The people in front of me let in about 30 people (I am not
exagering!)  during the hour wait and the folks behing me let in about 10 to
15. I saw the same thing going on all up and down the line. This is not just
a couple people. The whole problem snowballs when all these new people in
front of you have there own set of friends that they let in. Some amazing
displays of attitude also:(

Maybe it's just cranky old me but this realization that all these people have
a total dis-respect for others. 

Funny thing is it only took about three minutes once I got inside to totally
change my mood and I am filled with good thought of the party.

peace,
martin

I'm going to be moving back to San Francisco next month and I'm going to be 
needing
another internet service provider. Right now I'm paying $25/100 hours online 
so I would
like to find something comparable.

Thanks in advance,

Geoff declares:

For such a popular club party, ComeUnity has managed to maintain a general 
sense of togetherness and raging intensity that can compel even the most
responsible of citizens to blow off a workday for. ;)

>I arrived at 3:30 expecting to see things thinned out a bit,
>I didn't expect a line half-way around the block.

The strange thing about this was that it never seemed to get too
crowded inside.  I've been to CU's with much shorter lines and more 
people.  I thought the flesh density on Weds. was perfect.

>I missed everyones set but Markie but he was  "doin it" when I got there

I felt that Simon's set was more consistant.  Markie had some really
amazing peaks, though.  Earlier, I caught the last 1/2 of Max's set 
which was also very good.

Mike Bolger observes:
>Wendsay night also found me at times among people who seemed to have a

Yes, there was a fair amount of this.  But for the most part the
Vibesters in the house were able to overcome it with enough postivie
energy to keep things focused.  My main bitch was with the lack of
ventilation on the main floor, usually not a problem at 1015.  The 
basement chill zone was comfy though.  Did Velocette ever play live
as advertised?  I went down there occasionally to check, but all I saw
was some guy putting on a lame kung fu exhibition.

>Wednsay night found me in the company of some good friends and famaliar 
>faces. For that I'm grateful. 

Yep, me too.  All-in-all, CU delivered the goods. I heard that the 
Minna street afterparty went off as well.

Hmmm...

Could the reason that so many people showed up have anything to do with 
MTV being in town?

Hi Martin, I think we waited in line together!

> >...at times it felt like raving with the cast of 90210.
> What's up with waiting line dynamics? Was it just that night ...?

No offense to your fabulous company in line but it was fucking boring.
All the cutting in line reminded me of a bad day at Great America with
annoying packs of teenagers terrorizing families for kicks.

[Note that this week is going to be a stressful one, as the Telecomm
 Reform bill is on the Senate floor and things are moving *very quickly*.
 We're trying very hard to minimize the numbers of letters we send out,
 and the size of the alerts.

 If you feel they're coming too fast and are thinking about unsubscribing,
 please consider waiting until the end of next week, when the traffic
 will die down again. -Shabbir]

THE LATEST NEWS

First there was the Exon/Gorton Internet Censorship bill.  Then, there
was the Dole/Grassley bill, which would criminalize "profane" speech
among other things.  Then came the Lott amendment, which would make
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) liable for the traffic of their
users.  Now, Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN) has announced his intention to
introduce his very own legislation.  Since obscenity is already
illegal, it's unclear what benefits Coats' legislation will bring.

However given the tradition of the Senate's attempts at restricting the
Internet (Exon/Gorton, Feinstein, Dole/Grassley, and Lott) it's
becoming clear that few people are taking the First Amendment into
account when drafting their legislation.

As you read this, the Telecommunications Reform bill is being debated
on the Senate floor.  The Exon/Gorton Internet Censorship language
is *in that bill*.

If the net as a whole doesn't do anything, the Exon bill will become
a reality.

Even if it's found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court several years
from now, the damage it will do in terms of BBS seizures and chilling
speech in the meantime will make online systems a very different and
sad place.

A few days ago we put out an alert asking people to call Congress and
Vice President Gore.  This generated significant support and we've
even seen Senators' offices take notice of the fact that lots of computer-
literate individuals are calling to point out the problems with the
Exon/Gorton bill.

If you already called, *thank you*.  Your comments warmed the hearts of
several of us, who have been swamped trying to process all the mail
you sent.  You have done your country proud.  Just as heart-warming
have been the letters from those abroad, who took the time to email
(and even call!) Vice President Gore.  We hope we can return the
favor somehow someday.

However, many of us have not called or faxed.  If you haven't done so
yet, take a moment to do that now.  Make your voice heard in
Washington.  Remind the Senate, which is paying more attention now to
voters than it has in several years, that you care about this new
medium that enables us to communicate in such an unprecedented
many-to-many fashion.  Demand the *exact same* rights and
responsibilities for speech in the digital world as we expect in
print media, no more, no less.

________________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW -- U.S. and non-U.S. citizens

The Telecomm Reform Bill currently includes the Exon/Gorton Internet
Censorship bill.  Leahy intends to offer a swap, to remove the Exon
language in exchange for his bill which advocates a study of the issue,
with an emphasis on the preservation of the First Amendment and
parental control.  The other proposals could become involved as well.

It is essential that the Leahy language be substituted for Exon's, and
therefore it is essential:

1. That all citizens call or fax their Senators as soon as possible.
   There is no time for written letters and email is too easily
   discounted or ignored. Non-U.S. citizens should contact Vice
   President Gore.  Note, if you decide to send a fax, you'll want to
   write an expanded version of the statement below.

   It's very important that you always be cool, collected, and polite.

   U.S. citizens:
        <call your Senators' offices, contact info below>
        "Hello, Senator ________'s office"
        "Hi, I'm a constituent and would like to register my
         opinion on the Telecommunications Reform bill to the           
         Senator.  May I please speak to the technology staffer,
         _________?"
        "Hold On please.  Alright, go ahead."

        "Please oppose the Exon/Gorton bill (Title 4 of the Telecomm
         bill) and other bills for censoring the Internet.  Please
         support the Leahy alternative (S714) which examines these
         issues.  My name and address are ________."

        "Thanks for calling."
        <click>

   Non-U.S. citizens:
        <call, fax, or send email to Vice President Gore>
        "Dear Vice President Gore,

         The world looks to the United States as one of the leaders in
         developing a Global Information Infrastructure.  Title 4 of
         the Telecomm Reform bill and other Internet censorship bills
         imperil that leadership.  Please work to remove them from the
         Telecomm Reform bill (S652) and support Senator Leahy's
         sensible alternative (S714).  I'm calling from ____________."


2. Send VTW a note telling us what you did. If you contacted your two
   Senators, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of
   "XX ack" where "XX" is your state.  For example:

        To: vtw@vtw.org
        Subject: OH ack

        I called my Ohio Senators and expressed my opinion.

   If you contact Senators outside your state, please let us know what
   state you're from.

   If you contacted Vice President Gore, send a letter to vtw@vtw.org with
   a subject line of "gore ack".  For example:

        To: vtw@vtw.org
        Subject: gore ack

        I called VP Gore and expressed my opinion.  I'm from France.

   An automatic responder will return an updated contact tally.

3. Forward this alert to relevant forums on other online services and
   BBS's.  Check the letter you get back to see which Senators are
   underrepresented by citizen contacts. Forward the Alert to any
   friends and colleagues in those states.

4. If you haven't yet signed the petition to support Sen. Leahy,
   do so now at http://www.cdt.org/petition.html.  If you don't have
   WWW access, send mail to vtw@vtw.org with a subject line of
   "send petition" for directions.

5. Congratulate yourself!  Your two-minute activism joins that of many
   thousands of others over the past two months.

I use and have been very happy with "Community ConneXion: The
NEXUS-Berkeley"        the dial in number is 510-658-6376. You can login as
"guest" or http://www.c2.org. $10 per month unlimited time. Community
ConneXion is a small provider with Berkeley phone numbers only. Sameer the
Network Administrator is friendly and helpful. He has never taken longer
than 48 hours (usually less than 24) to answer my questions. Compare this
to Netcom where it takes a week to get an "answer" that is no help at all.

     Hi!  Sorry to bother everybody, but I was wondering if anyone still 
     has the date that Wicked is going to be in Boulder, CO.  My little 
     sister wants to go to her first rave =).  Also any info numbers would 
     be appreciated.  Thanks in advance!

CU waiting -

We had to wait to get in, and then wait for them to
turn up the music (even use all the speakers).  It was all show, 
all night long.  Pure party antics.  Save it for the Cow Palace.

I noticed also, that the (greatly outnumbered) people who showed up
solo tended to frown and then respectfully take a spot at the end of
the line.  Any group of 4 or more seemed to cut right in front of me.

I can't recall ever waiting that long for any party.  Anything that has
ever looked close to that, I've left.  I have no idea what possessed me 
on Wednesday to stick it out.  A great urge to go dancing??
I admit.  2 ft inside and my spirits lifted greatly.  
Their line manipulation was a success.


 
raving with the cast of 90210 -

I was struck by how very Preppy the crowd was.
Where were all the Freaks?  There were only a few.
Let me make myself crystal clear:   MORE SLEAZY FREAKS



Vanilla Ice attitude and a Fabio Perm -

I think you are refering to Me.
And I do take offense to your hair comment.
Bad Ass Vanilla Dave ... yeah, I like it, kinda
gives me goose bumps all over ...

Besides the mainstream, Very Weekend, suburban feel to the party
it was probably As Good of a Crowd like that as I've found.  They 
were happy and nice as far as I saw.  I missed any attitude.  

In a way, it was sorta fun to find yourself dancing with a very
familiar face amongst all the muck (a nice happy muck, mind you).



I don't think there was really much teaching going on at the party.  
This crowd had the Basics.  They really swamped the place, though.

Dave

Hooray!  Everything's all confirmed and paid for, I'll be arriving in your
fair city at 5:10 p.m. on Alaska Airlines flight 88!!!!  And as for a place
to stay ... the BLACK ADDER ... :) a prince among ravers and his lady have
graciously consented to let me stay with them while I am in SF.  Happy am

The last dust will be tonight and I hope to see many friends there.  My
housemate Jon Carell will be spinning the last set (after Jonah Sharpe and
either Frank or Ellen.)  I encourage any who haven't seen him to stop by and
check it out.  If I don't see you there maybe I'll see you at sol'y' luna.

hello all,

last night amy t. and I checked out the black diamond at the oddball 
lounge in the City.  

i got there about midnight and was greeted most friendily by the lovely 
and glamourous doormaven, who charged me a mere $4 and hoped i would have 
a nice time.  i assured her i would and went in.

the sight of many happy, friendly youngish-looking people greeted me once 
inside.  there were also lots of candles, a parachute suspended over the 
dance floor, a projection tv and some non-cheezy art on the walls of this 
cosy club/bar.  all the customary rave accoutrement designed to make one 
feel right at home. 

the crowd was a bit thin, but a few were really getting into the 
reggae-inspired dub of dj mike, who was pretty damn good, i thought.  
folks wandered off and on the dance floor and not much vibe was 
achieved.  but all the same, pretty good for the night after a comeunity.

then, gasp, felix went on.  well, in my opinion, he is the best dj in san 
francisco right now.  he goes beyond the usual cliches of cheezy house.  
the stuff he plays is not in category that i can think of, except maybe 
"triphop heavy dub," a phrase not-of-my-inventing.  anyway, he plays a 
lot of stuff that has a heavy hiphop beat, but which also incorporates 
trippy electronic sounds.  but in a way that gives the music power.  it 
is very very intense to listen and dance to his records, because it dips 
down into the ambient realm often and then powers right up again with a 
heavy heavy beat.  well, more than a few good records does a good dj 
make...he also has that indefinable ability to know what to give a crowd 
to take it some place emotionally.  there was a definite vibe in 
effect on the dance floor and it was not the usual "let's all dance 
until we die" kind of thing.  gone were the usual rote housey moves, i 
noted.  people were really getting into it and were developing some new 
moves, some new steps, it seemed.  cool.

the black diamond..every thursday night..as far as i am concerned is the 
happening thing right now.  the music and the vibe makes everything 
else out there look like a cliche.  if you just want to take your pill 
and zone out..which is quite fun, i admit!...go do the 1015 thing.  but 
you sfravers usually want more than that..so go check out the black 
diamond.  the afore-mentioned door-maven says they could use more 
support and said to tell you guys all about it.  


love,

Ann

I know I've posted here a bunch today but I'll be too busy this weekend
to post so I'm just stackin up.

Also I've been testing and demoing Internet today, so I've been online
for most of the day.

What I really wanted to mention was, has anyone noticed the vibe here on
SFRAVES lately. I like the direction we are going. A much better
positive attitude and more realistic approaches to problems.

I LIKE IT ALOT!

A DeadHead posted the following comment about the Saturday Dead show at
Shoreline:

> On Sat. night we went to the Disco Bus in the C lot (I think), this is a
strange feeling, classic disco blaring >from the top of a Ryder truck,
crystal clear, with a hundred people dancing disco.  

Is this his interpretation of techno/house music, or was there actually a
retro-70's-disco bus?

Cheers,

Ken

Amen.  The Vibe has gotten MUCH better on this list.  It used to be that I
would delete huge amounts of the mail 'cause it seemed OVERLY political
and very negative in focus.  As of late i've enjoyed reading most ALL
the mail i've received.

Thanks to you all!

hehe, YES..  that's right
pronounced Whore - hay  ;P

I heard about something like this happening at the Vegas dead shows a
while back. (Either that or i dreamed it). The descriptions I heard
made it sound like it really was disco, not techno.

PS: Speaking of retro, how's this for the Eye-popper of the year: Melle
Mel comes on stage w/ Duran Duran at BFD yesterday. Performs "White
Lines" and other Sugarhill Gang classics. I was exceedingly happy,
mostly because I was so pleasantly surprised... (was expecting to be
bored/nauseaus during Duran Duran). Too bad tmey couldn't get rid of
Simon le Boner and just let Melle Mel and the band do their thing....

Unquestionably Disco (with a capital D).
That bus has been following the Dead around for years.
I keep looking for Atomic Critters and finding the disco bus instead.

No, there really was a bloke playing disco from his bus and it was good 
disco too, from the 1970's.  I reckon that that guy should travel around 
town with the thing barring at all times because nothing puts your 
average Joe Blow in a good mood like a spot of good disco.  "I am aboard the 
freedom bus going to good time city, and I haven't even paid my fare!"

Thanks for all those who tried to come out to the MESS/Harmony/Cloud 
Factory party north of Santa Cruz.  We got busted right as we were 
starting.  There were several reasons for this but I think the main one 
was the amount of people that showed up.  Some of the secondary reasons 
were our fault and we are sorry about the disorganiztion that happened 
although things came togethere pretty well (I'd like to thanks Greg from 
Harmony who pulled off a lot of what needed to be done the day of).  The 
problem of too many people partly stemmed from XYZ's flawed idea of 
trying to hold their fifteen dollar bass/tickettron rave at Bonny 
Doon...what a  brilliant idea!  So about half of the crowd that stopped 
at ours thought they had paid fifteeen dollars for our party (although it 
was free =).  Needless to say hopefully everyone involved the organizing 
part of things is more aware, more conscious of the things that need to 
happen before/during a party, and we all learned/gained somethnig from 
what happeneed.  Once again thanks to those people who did come and all 
the above groups will be having parties again soon (i don't know when) 
but they will be going off like a lot of parties before these by these 
roups!!

love drenalin

Although Harmony, Mess, cloudfactory got bustsed when we were ready to dance
our happy feet off.  The night wasn't a total loss, our troupe had a lil'
shindig out in Davenport beach (out past the RR tracks).  Playing in the
sand, cold, cold ocean and bumming wood off our fellow beachcombers all night
into the early morning was actually fairly entertaining consilation prize....
Too bad no one had a box with the funky trancy toons.

My first weekend back in SF
Well,  after a really packed Come/Unity,  I had a big fat grin on my
face,  for a long time afterwards.

On Friday,  I get word of a party out in the woods in Marin County,  so
I call the info number,  feed the audio into MicMac for later playback
and transcriptions,  and transcribe the complex directions.   Of course
I won't divulge the location for this party,   because it served it's
purpose well,   and provided an excellent backdrop for some of the most
insane trance I've heard,   even coming from Australia.

It turns out that DJ Mars who used to put on the 8th and Kirkham parties
a few years ago,  have decided to scout around for some killer
underground rave sites,  and really scored on this one.

We head to the designated spot just in time for a car to drive up and a
familiar friend says "Get in,  I'll take you to the entrance trail to
the site"..   He drops us off,  and we proceed to head into the woods,
listening for the familiar thump thump of the music.   We hear nothing
from the road.

Our friend said "Look for the glow sticks marking the path".   It wasn't
hard to miss,  because someone broke open a glow stick and sprayed it
along the path.   Looked kinda trippy...    Eventually,  we hear the
music and not long after that,   was totally into some really wicked
trance.   It was almost a full moon,  and lit up the area really well.

DJ Mars eventually went on,  and upped the BPM a lot,   despite the
bitching from some people complaining about the speed.

It was the ultimate setting for some of the most insane German trance
one can imagine.   The amount of people peaked at around 70 - 80 Ppl,
and naturally wasn't one of those Mega raves.   The vibe was all smiles
as I bounced around,   or at least my body did.   My head,  however was
certainly not in the immediate vicinity.  It was probably out there
somewhere far far away.

The ground wasn't the best surface to dance on,   so I changed my dance
style to fit the conditions,  and let the music take total control of my
physical being.

The end came far too soon for me,   but the promoters thought it would
be a good idea to pack up and leave,  before a hiker discovered us.   An
hour later,   not even a cigarette butt was seen in the area.

I very stupidly took a ride with a friend who wanted to leave sooner
than he thought.   I checked and found out that DJ Mars was going to
have to pass through Mill Valley on the way back,  so I had a ride home.

After DJ Mars dropped me home,   I started making plans to go to yet
another outdoor party yet again in Marin.   WOW!!  Lucky me!!   not just
ONE outdoor party,   but TWO of them,   12 hours apart,  and even in the
same county.

Again,   out came MicMac and after transcribing the directions,
gleefully aim the car in the right direction and take off.   WOW!!  We
were treated to the most awesome scenery,  as the clouds clung on top of
the hills.  Now,  THIS site was PRIMO!!    Right along the coast,
fully permitted to go till 9 PM,  and was the ideal picnic setting with
some really slow and funky house on a lazy Saturday afternoon.

It was an absolutely perfect afternoon,   with yet more people
discovering that I've returned,  I've been busy filling them in on my
Australian trip.   Got in some great Frisbee fun in the sun,  danced my
ass off,  and hiked up and around the surrounding hills.   These
conditions make for some rather interesting acoustical effects,  as the
music reverberated through the hills.

The music lasted until about 8 PM,   after the ranger came and told us
we had to leave.   The rangers were rather pushy,  and we eventually
left.

I headed back with my friend who wanted to take me to see "Congo",
which had bad reviews.   After the flick,  I drop my friend home and
transcribe the lengthy directions,  and head out to "Friends and
Family's" free party in Bizerkeley.   Friends and Family consists mostly
of SFRvers and their friends.   These parties usually tend to GET OFF in
a very big way,   yet remain small.   Again,  there were about 70 - 80
Ppl dancing to some trancy house.   Was discovered by yet more SFRavers
who wanted to talk,   so wasn't immediately in the dance area.   Dancing
surface rather poor,  but it didn't take me long to discover the hidden
rocks and dance over them.

Alex (originally from the UK) spun a rather low energy set,   but I
didn't really care,  as I was experimenting with new movements,  trying
some of my Happy Hard-core movements with house.   It didn't take me
long to trance out and really get into the groove.

Alex's set sorta fizzled out,  so took some time out to schmooze and
stretch after 2 hours of solid dancing.

After Alex came on,  this Japanese lady took to the turntables,  I
didn't get here name,  but she was really very good.   She started with
some strange noises,  which formed into some really trancey tunes.

Minor went on,  and after a really good start,  literally started to
escalate the energy to a very high level.   I don't know what he played,
but the people literally went insane,   yelling and shouting as this
very high energy track was on.   Ethan quickly ran up (And a few of the
other DJ's) to see what record he was playing.   Minor just handed him
the album cover with a shit eatin grin on his face.   WOW!! Whatta
score!

Didn't get the name of the last DJ,   but his set was really consistent
and trancey.

I've finally figured out the reason why Calif. dudes don't like hard-
core.   It don't have Soul!!

This party went on,  totally un-molested by porkey pig.   Again,  the
site was put back exactly like it was before,   except a little neater.

I immediately went home,  and had just enough time for breakfast before
the Dypsea run started at 8:30 in the morning.   Although I'm not
running in this 8 mile race over logs, trails,  and roads from Mill
Valley to Stinson Beach,   I wanted to see what the kick off was like.

This brings us to Sunday...   Haight Street Fair...   Oh Goodie..  A
really cool place to hang out....  All of Upper Haight is blocked off,
and cars are replaced with food venders,  jewelry,  and other fine
craft,  with live music at each end.

Ameba had a van with a sound system,   but was asked to remove it,  so
the music was just played in the store.   Just after Tracy spun,  I
walked out just in time to hear Paul Kantner and the Jefferson Starship
play "Volunteers of America".    People were going insane dancing in the
streets.   The energy was awesome...

After the fair,   we run into Galen of Sunset fame,  who informs us of a
small house party at his place on the Haight.   His place was 3 blocks
from Ameba,  so we head over.    I didn't even need his address,
because he hung his speakers over the balcony,  aimed them out into the
streets and pumped up the volume.

Hanging from his balcony was an "I love House" flag,  with "love"
replaced with a heart inside a house.

This party WENT OFF!!   People stopping in front of galens house to
dance to some of the most insane trancey house I've heard in a long
time.   WOW!!  So much new music around.

Galens flat was up on the 3rd story,  overlooking the street below.
Galen's turn tables facing out the window,  gives him an unobstructed
view of the crowd below.   Just about everyone was dancing for over a
hundred feet in either direction from his flat,  as he was skillfully
working the crowd.

I was standing on the fire escape waving my arms at the crowd below...

Eventually two cops barge in and stopped the music,   but we turned off
the outside speakers,  and let in anyone who wanted to continue dancing.

We went to yet another party,  where Solar was spinning.   The energy
was awesome,   as everyone was trying to crowd in the small bedroom
where Solar has his tables.

All in all,  for my first weekend back,   I pulled a coupe....
Although I had to stay awake the entire time with NO opportunity to
meditate,   I still had the energy to enjoy myself to the fullest
possible....   Hope you all did the same...

How low can you go?
Well I guess this is pretty low.
Bonny Doon has been a site for *free* parties for over 20 years.
It amazes me the cluelessness that some folks can have, not only is
this crass but they mess the situation up for _every_one who may
want to throw a party down there in the future.  Well, I guess I won't
be going to any of these guys parties....

	When I visited the bus friday, it was 70's at first but moved to house 
after awhile.  My interpretation was that it was intended as a sort of Purgatory 
to reduce/refine the crowd (you had to know what was coming), but who knows.

This was a nice little Saturday daytime party in a great location
in the Marin Headlands, just 5 minutes past the GG Bridge.  They 
had a permit to go until sundown, which was around 8, I guess. 
One portosan, no running water or shade, but a nice big grassy field
surrounded by beautiful green hills.  This would be a great location
for a Sunset or a morning afterparty.  The permits are supposed to 
be cheap, like $35.  Amplified sound is supposedly OK because of a
nearby rifle range.

Very nice sound system with Community speakers like Ethan's, a bit
smaller perhaps.  Solor and DJ Unknown (Josh Bates) spun fairly 
relaxed sets while we were there.  The 60 or so people who showed 
up were laid back & friendly.  We only stayed for 3.5 hours and 
some folks were still arriving as we left.  The guys putting this 
on seem to be pretty cool; they brought around a really nice 
fruit spread and had plenty of garbage bags on hand.  Looking
forward to more from these folks.

Yeah, most of Friday and Saturday night was disco (Bee Gees, Village People,
Jackson Five, ect..) But on Sunday they played more house.  NO2 tanks going  
off everywhere.  It was kinda fun in a silly excessive sort of way.

That's funny cause the people putting it on haven't decided
where it's going to be yet :)


Anyway there WILL be a FMR tonight, the location HAS NOT been
determined no matter what you may have heard.


Anyway when the info does become available PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE
don't post it to the net.

That's funny...

I saw that UFO, the 70's AOR band (that's how I perceive them), is 
playing at the Edge - I think this is the same band...

On the other hand on Sunday at the 42degrees in SF, UFO, The United 
Future Organization, is performing at the One The One party. This UFO is 
from Japan - They reconstruct all sorts of jazz into acid jazz... I think 
they are great!

UFO are not performing...one of the members of UFO, Raphael Sebbag 
(sp?) will be dj'ing, along with Kruder and Dorfmeister and DJ 
Takemura..Omar will be performing.

should be a great evening of soul, acid jazz, ambient and abstract hiphop.

I know that people aren't supposed to the location of tonight's rave, but if
ANYONE sees this in time, could they possibly email me privately, or call me,
(510.649.7449), or *timothy holds his breath* maybe even give a ride to a car-
less berkeley kid?  I'd LOVE to go and I promise I'll bring lots of happy vibes!
Thank you,

I'm sorry, but I don't see at all why you told everyone "not to post" the full
moon info on the net... jesus what's the big deal?  How are we who aren't cool
enough to know a promoter supposed to find out about it?! I understand that
you don't want to get busted, or that maybe you'd like an intimate party, but
look at what F&F did this weekend--THEY had an outdoor party too, but they helpe -
ed everyone out by at least providing a phone number... and what, do you think
we'll all run off and notify the SF police department?  Trust us, we won't...
Man, sorry to vent on you Geoff, and I hate to judge your intentions from here,
and maybe this goes on all the time, but I think you could have helped every-
one out a bit more.

My roommate and fellow sfraver Jonathan Wells and I are going to be doing a pavillion at NARNIA, which is going to happen this August on an Indian Reservation in the desert outside of San Diego.  Quite a few of our friends want to go too, so we've been looking into renting a bus to take everybody down.  It would either be one of those luxury busses with a VCR, sound system and comfy seats, or a cool old hippy bus with no chairs, just pillows (!)
We've talked to quite a few bus companies and it looks like the bottom line is that it would cost around $50 to $60 per person.  That would include getting into Narnia, too.
Is there anyone else who would be interested in going?  If you are, please email me asap since we're going to have to decide whether or not to do it soon.
Also, does anyone know of a good place to rent a bus which we might not have contacted yet?

No lineup has been announced for Narnia yet but the last three have been pretty incredible.  Some of the DJ's have included Robbie Hardkiss, Soulslinger, Jon Bishop, Dmitry, Mark E. Quark (****!!) Jason Bentley and tons of other cool djs. Also last year there was an amazing live performance by CRASH WORSHIP in the bottom of a gravel quarry(!!).  There was also a cool chill area beside a small lake and a path to a secret buddhist temple far away from the site.  And there were tons of people camping out ...

Just a reminder about the "SFRaves South Bay Lunch" 

 For those who don't know , the South Bay Lunch is basically
me with a CD/Cassette/radio boom-box , ready for a nice day in
the sunshine! Attendence has varied from me/myself & I on up to
nine SFRavers , depending on people's schedules. At special times,
we've met at a restaurant ( no boom-box , tho' .... ).

 It's every Wednesday , depending on my own work schedule , the
weather , and park usage . I hope to see you folks there!

				Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com
-----------------
 By the way - I was thinking of meeting at a restaurant next
week Wednesday. There's supposed to be a Chinese restaurant
in Mountain View on Castro Street called "Rave" (!) - anybody
know anything about it? It's my leading candidate , but I've 
never been there myself.
------------------------------------------------------------------

What: The SFRaves South Bay Lunch ...

When: Wednesday  
Time: 11:55AM to 1:10PM or so ... 
Where: Greer Park, Palo Alto

Directions:

* From 101 (South or North) take the Oregon Expressway Exit
  Northbound: Past San Antonio Road 
  Southbound: Past University Avenue 

* Left at the first signal - W. Bayshore
  (it's a frontage road that takes you south again)

* Follow this road approx. 1/4 mile (pass apartment complexes on right)
  
* You will see the park on your right hand side. Turn into the first 
  driveway on your right.

* We'll meet on the grassy knoll , behind the round baseball fence.
  Next to the restrooms and ball courts.

Bring lunch, toys, yourselves!

Greetings Friends.

Many thanks to all of you who helped make sol'y'luna a very, very magic
evening. This one will be with me a long time.

The night itself was nothing short of amazing: the moon, the deep purple
sky, the massive cloudscapes, the city and bridges quietly glowing while
the stars sparkled and fell out of the heavens. =)

It is also gives me great pleasure that, with the exception of some
flattened grass, we left the site absolutely pristine, perhaps even better
than we found it. This is as it should be. People live there, animals live
there, it is anything but a dump.

Thanks too to everyone that helped lug speakers, amps, etc. down that long,
long road, the help was greatly appreciated.

I do have one small request though: please *do not* bring or support the
presence of nitrous at future F&Fs, it is not welcome.

love ya
ethan

I remember some big discussions about this, probably around the time
3000 people showed up for a Bonney Doon fmr.  I agree with you, Timothy,
I think it is pretty safe to toss out just about any renegade info to
this list.  Ultimately, if the folks throwing the party don't want
that to happen, then there isn't much more to say about it.

Given how Packed CU was, I suspect there are lots of people with more
midweek free time (summer vacation?) ... So if they have an intimate party
in mind, it is maybe understandable for them to be super-secretive about
the directions.

Dropping by one of the weeklies is considered a good way to hook up.
I don't recommend standing outside and hassling the door people or other
club-goer's though.  I've seen this before.  I recall one desperate
group of summer ravers being sent on a wild goose chase by the
less than amused Endup doorman ...

It is such a fiendy gas.  And it makes you quite a moron.  I don't think

Thank YOU Ethan!  It was an event that will stay with all of us for a very
long time. For some of us, the magic of sol'y'luna will continue to grow
and prosper for years to come...I made new friends, and possibly some
family.  ;^)

For anyone who does not know Ethan, this small request reveals his true
nature.  You see, he could easily have asked for the nitrous to be removed
immediately.  He did not.  I think that shows the mature attitude and
approach to these events that he brings.

It takes a strong person to accept and deal with something they're not fond
of, and wait to mention it at a more prudent time, in a forum where it will
be respected.  I hope his request does not fall on numbed ears....

Dance free this weekend!

And hey...Respect each other out there!

P.S.  I hope Sunset gets rained out, 'cause I can't be there!  :^p (Just

please keep in mind that this is not the band UFO, but the United 
Future Organization, just so you don't confuse the two and get 
dissappointed. I dunno about F/X and who will be spinning there. If 
it's this weekend, and it's acid jazz then i'd figure it's Raphael 
Sebbag of the United Future Org.

        Reply to:   RE>>Narnia!

NARNIA is a massive "rave" (or whatever) which is put together by Global Underworld Network and is going to be held at an Indian Reservation in Southern California in August.  I don't hink there's a definite date yet.  There have been three so far (one each summer for the past 3 years).  The last one was held on this beautiful Indian quarry/campground in the desert about halfway between San Diego and LA.  There were about 6,000 people there, so it was pretty massive, but it didn't feel like one of those huge corporate raves.  It ususally lasts from the afternoon until the afternoon of the next day.  Check out the cover of the last DEEE-LITE record, which is heavily influenced by the poster for the last NARNIA and keep an eye on URB magazine for updates as to who will be there  ...

Ahhh....Burning Man. The most amazing three days I have spent yet on this
planet.
A difficult experience to describe. Here are a couple little passages that
capture the sense of the thing:

---------------

"It is difficult to transmute into words the oddness of an image. The comic
grotesque distortions of inner time and space, the weird amalgams of feeling
that leave people perhaps a little more aware of their deepest responses to
life, and a little more unsure of the artifice with which they cover
themselves."(from Larry Harvey's((one of BM's creators))answering machine
message

---------------

Q: I've heard you describe the ritual of Burning Man as sacred.

A: Sure-if you view the experience in terms of how it works, what it does,
and how people respond to it. It's true we've never claimed it's
supernatural. We have no metaphysical doctrines that people have to believe,
but all that's unnecessary baggage. Functionally and phenomenally I'd
describe it as sacred. Consider what we do. We build this giant statue that
is larger-than-life and which glows in the dark. Then take it to the
desert-stage a pilgrimage. Our art's always playful, yet most of it is cast
in ritual form. There are torchlight processions, visionary spectacles, and
all of this culminates in an act of sacrifice. Priests and Shamans have
employed these methods since the Stone Age. I also know encounters with the
sacred inspire certain powerful emotions: awe, fear, delight, a sense of the
uncanny, and over all, a peculiar sort of transcendence.

Ahhhhh...........

Burning man this yeAr will be bigger and better then it ever has before - 
at least the rave section will be.  S.P.A.Z. will be in full effect 
featuring guest dj's such as Goa Gill.  It will be seventy two hours of 
not stop pparty time!  And then, of course, there is the deasert 
itself................................Trisan.

Not to prolong this downer thread longer than necessary, but there have been
instances where narcs go to raves to bust drug dealers.  Some friends o-mine
just almost had a run-in with them at a very recent Sacramento rave.  I
would think in that case they would just want to know about the party and
where it's located.  But really, enough....

To all those who were unfortuant  enough to miss last nights full-moon 
rave you missed what can only be described as one of the nicest full moon 
raves that I have ever been to (and I"ve been to a few!).  As with other 
cool parties/rave related issues in the bay area Mark and Tracy from 
Ameba were in full effect.  Tracy played some of the nicest music that I have
heard at a party in years; she  is with out a doubt a true master of her art.
I won't go on and on about how nice it was on the beech, or how nice the 
people were, or how beautiful the vibe was.  Those that already know I 
will respect by not preaching to the converted; for those that don't, get a 
life!
But I would like to say thank you to everyone that went especially 
those that gave me a ride there and back.
Lots of love and happiness, Tristan.

Thought for the day:
"What is your philosophy on life?"  Asked the boy to the wise man.  "To 
live it."

Well, with such a beautiful full moon, it was a bright nite everywhere 
last nite...

That's funny...

I saw that UFO, the 70's AOR band (that's how I perceive them), is 
playing at the Edge - I think this is the same band...

On the other hand on Sunday at the 42degrees in SF, UFO, The United 
Future Organization, is performing at the One The One party. This UFO is 
from Japan - They reconstruct all sorts of jazz into acid jazz... I think 
they are great!

I'm sorry, but I don't see at all why you told everyone "not to post" the full
moon info on the net... jesus what's the big deal?  How are we who aren't cool
enough to know a promoter supposed to find out about it?! I understand that
you don't want to get busted, or that maybe you'd like an intimate party, but
look at what F&F did this weekend--THEY had an outdoor party too, but they helpe -
ed everyone out by at least providing a phone number... and what, do you think
we'll all run off and notify the SF police department?  Trust us, we won't...
Man, sorry to vent on you Geoff, and I hate to judge your intentions from here,
and maybe this goes on all the time, but I think you could have helped every-
one out a bit more.

That's funny cause the people putting it on haven't decided
where it's going to be yet :)


Anyway there WILL be a FMR tonight, the location HAS NOT been
determined no matter what you may have heard.


Anyway when the info does become available PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE
don't post it to the net.

I know that people aren't supposed to the location of tonight's rave, but if
ANYONE sees this in time, could they possibly email me privately, or call me,
(510.649.7449), or *timothy holds his breath* maybe even give a ride to a car-
less berkeley kid?  I'd LOVE to go and I promise I'll bring lots of happy vibes!

My roommate and fellow sfraver Jonathan Wells and I are going to be doing a pavillion at NARNIA, which is going to happen this August on an Indian Reservation in the desert outside of San Diego.  Quite a few of our friends want to go too, so we've been looking into renting a bus to take everybody down.  It would either be one of those luxury busses with a VCR, sound system and comfy seats, or a cool old hippy bus with no chairs, just pillows (!)
We've talked to quite a few bus companies and it looks like the bottom line is that it would cost around $50 to $60 per person.  That would include getting into Narnia, too.
Is there anyone else who would be interested in going?  If you are, please email me asap since we're going to have to decide whether or not to do it soon.
Also, does anyone know of a good place to rent a bus which we might not have contacted yet?

No lineup has been announced for Narnia yet but the last three have been pretty incredible.  Some of the DJ's have included Robbie Hardkiss, Soulslinger, Jon Bishop, Dmitry, Mark E. Quark (****!!) Jason Bentley and tons of other cool djs. Also last year there was an amazing live performance by CRASH WORSHIP in the bottom of a gravel quarry(!!).  There was also a cool chill area beside a small lake and a path to a secret buddhist temple far away from the site.  And there were tons of people camping out ...

UFO are not performing...one of the members of UFO, Raphael Sebbag

Takemura..Omar will be performing.

should be a great evening of soul, acid jazz, ambient and abstract hiphop.

Just a reminder about the "SFRaves South Bay Lunch" 

 For those who don't know , the South Bay Lunch is basically
me with a CD/Cassette/radio boom-box , ready for a nice day in
the sunshine! Attendence has varied from me/myself & I on up to
nine SFRavers , depending on people's schedules. At special times,
we've met at a restaurant ( no boom-box , tho' .... ).

 It's every Wednesday , depending on my own work schedule , the
weather , and park usage . I hope to see you folks there!

				Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com
-----------------
 By the way - I was thinking of meeting at a restaurant next
week Wednesday. There's supposed to be a Chinese restaurant
in Mountain View on Castro Street called "Rave" (!) - anybody
know anything about it? It's my leading candidate , but I've 
never been there myself.
------------------------------------------------------------------

What: The SFRaves South Bay Lunch ...

Time: 11:55AM to 1:10PM or so ... 
Where: Greer Park, Palo Alto

        Reply to:   RE>>Narnia!

NARNIA is a massive "rave" (or whatever) which is put together by Global Underworld Network and is going to be held at an Indian Reservation in Southern California in August.  I don't hink there's a definite date yet.  There have been three so far (one each summer for the past 3 years).  The last one was held on this beautiful Indian quarry/campground in the desert about halfway between San Diego and LA.  There were about 6,000 people there, so it was pretty massive, but it didn't feel like one of those huge corporate raves.  It ususally lasts from the afternoon until the afternoon of the next day.  Check out the cover of the last DEEE-LITE record, which is heavily influenced by the poster for the last NARNIA and keep an eye on URB magazine for updates as to who will be there  ...

Timothy, there's a whole long history of the interaction between sfraves and
the FMR that goes back more than two years.  Check out the archives at
hyperreal if you want to see all of it.  Basically, it's a matter of trying
to keep the FMRs from getting over-run, and keep the chain-of-friends-and-
acquaintances strong so that the party will endure over time.  Quite a f ew
people on the list are willing to pass along the location info when they get
it (I don't usually have it since I live in Portland and make only maybe
two or three FMRs a year), so email is the way to make contact and make those
arrangements.  

What was true two years ago is even more true now.  Lots and lots of people
monitor this list and distribute the info.  At the last Liquid that Bryrce
organized on the Bay, lots of people we'd never met showed up just based
on the listing in the calendar.  That was fine, but handling the FMRs is
so much more arduous because of typically limited parking and so on, but
most of all the need to maintain the good vibe based on not being over-run
by a lot of people who don't know the history and sensibility of the FMR.
We're also concerned that should something not go well, the list here would
possibly get the blame.

Ultimately, we are only respecting the organizing crew's wishes, just as
we would prefer to have aour wishes concerning publicity be respected for
any events we do.  I don't know whether announcing the FMR sites here would
really pose all that much a problem, but this is the determining factor.

Moon
It has the power to turn the tides
What power must it have on us mere humans?

Moon
Rays glowing
Caressing sand, skin
Warmth

Waves curl and crash...curl and crash...
And the beat goes on...

Moon
Beauty, strength, POWER

Turning...

Technology
Power, strength..... beauty?

Salt and cloves
and the beat goes on...

Moon
Filling me full of the energy
That keeps me sane

[ To sfraves and keiper@itsa.ucsf.EDU ]

 In the last two months , I've emailed questions about S.P.A.Z. events 
and DJs to Kevin Keiper's account at keiper@itsa.ucsf.EDU . This seemed
natural to me , as S.P.A.Z. has used Kevin's account to promote their
events on sfraves. So far , I have not had one reply to any of my email
questions to them , or Kevin Keiper either.

 Has anyone else had problems getting a dialog going with either Kevin
Keiper or the S.P.A.Z. folks via his account? Maybe he has some
strange one-way email problem , although that seems unlikely.

Or was it due to Wigstock? Though amusing to see its participants roam
about 1015 like "Priscilla Queen of the Desert," this event dominated the
main room until about 3 a.m. Thanks to Tracy for laying down some great
stuff at that time and transforming the space into a world that I frequent
more regularly. :) By the time I left around 4:45 the place was taking off.
Oh. Who was that spinning before Taj down in Zendada? He was putting on
such wicked trance! He really kept me going (though Taj was so-so, IMO,
with his same old stuff) until Tracy started spinning upstairs.

BTW, it was fun at Ameba's 'mini' during the Haight Street Fair. I thought
the dancers up on the cabinets were a nice touch!! Were they paid? (hee,
hee ) ;)

san francisco police raided a hip hop party in north beach  june 3, 
arresting and 
assaulting several people,  in response, an open forum is being planned 
for this thursday evening.

i don't have all the details, but i do know that the police said they 
were responding to a complaint of drinking in the street, tho' no bottles 
were found, and that they then just went in and shut down the party.  at 
least one person who was attempting to videotape police conduct was maced 
in the face.

the reason i'm posting this to sfraves is because it's clearly an issue 
we have in common (our right to party, gather, etc.) and i think it would 
be a good idea for all those interested to attend the forum in support.

it's thursday evening, 7 - 9:00, at 435 Broadway, bet. Montgomery and 
Kearny (in north beach).  i'll be there.

take care everyone,
monicat

Sorry to post this but I couldn't resist:

>>To all those who were unfortuant  enough to miss last nights full-moon rave
you missed what can only be described as one of the nicest full moon raves
that I have ever been to (and I"ve been to a few!).<<

Well tristan I'd love to go to a "nice rave" once in a while, but, if no one
is going to give me a # or local then I guess I'll have to miss out =(

>>I won't go on and on about how nice it was on the beech, or how nice the
people were, or how beautiful the vibe was.  Those that already know I will
respect by not preaching to the converted; for those that don't, get a
life!<<

Now that hurt Tristan... We should all respect each other, even if we don't
have the right connections to all of renagades that go on.

Oh, well. I dont like to flame  (bad Karma) so till then.....

  Sol y Luna was one of those rare nights of pure inspiration that this city
has given me -- something like bicycling down to the Jack London Club in
Oakland, years ago, for Mr. Floppy's Flophouse.  It was such an idyllic &
unlikely spot, and such a lovely group of people to spend the early hours
with!  I got there around 2:30 AM to the sound of Alex's sublime & blissful
grooves.  Chizuru played a wildfire set, mixing on a dime, and pumping it
quite hard -- a tough act to follow!  In any case, I had the most ecstatic
experience I've ever had behind turntables, and on nothing stronger than
grapefruit juice.  Parafin put a nice cap on the evening, with a warm flow of
trance/house tunes.  The clouds opened up somewhere in the last few moments
before 7, and it was good.  Thanks again to everyone involved!

     It began friday at dust...  I loved the music, the people and the
lights.  The laser was awesome!!!  
     After two hours sleep I biked down to meet up with sme friends and
headed for the American river.  We were 5 rafts of good food and good
friends.  The weather was wonderfull!  The only thing that could have
improved it would have required  putting a sound system into one of the
rafts...  We ended the trip with a bar-b-que.  
     After some food and a shower the sfravers in the group went home to
change for so'y'luna and to pick up a newbie.  We all walked towards the
site looking and listening with nervous anticipation.  The first thing we
heared was the  rythmic thumping of the base  we walked in awe of the
location.  So close to the city and yet a world quite seperate from our own.  
     When we finally arrived the only light to mark the spot came form the
moon a string of x-mas lights and the dj's tables.  The music was great...
I made new friends, saw old firends and helped introduce a new comer to the
"rave" experience.  Depite lack of sleep the music kept me dancing well into
the morning.  The experience as a whoe was reminiscent of my first fmr on
panther beach back in march...   Another completely wonderfull experince.
Before crashing blissfullly at a friends place a bunch of us went to Noahs
for breakfast.  
     Thanks to The Friends and Family crew, all the dj's and especially all
the wonderfull people who attended.    

            Smiles,
                         Reza

I think I've heard of an ORB afterparty at 111 Minna by the people 
who put on the Sunday morning Scrambled weekely.  Does anyone have
their number?  	It doesn't seem to be on the calender.

I heard something about the friday night Orb after-party being
limited to a fairly small number of people and that advanced tickets 
were being sold for it.  I didn't really pay attention to the details.

I had the same after-party question, but for Sacramento's show on
Saturday night.  Anyone?

To all those annoyed about lack of information about the S.P.A.Z. tour my 
(Tristan's) reply is "your not te only one!  All information about the 
tour was posted by Aaron from S.P.A.Z. and not by me and you know as much 
on what is going on as I do.  Presumably people got the post about the 
dates and the one about the party in Oaklahoma City going off but getting 
busted at 4.00 am.  So I merely know what everyone else does which is why 
I have not posted anything on this subject (what would be the poiint?).
Yours Tristan.

It's limited to 250 and only via advance tickets. From the info I've been
given it's not at 111 Minna either.

This has been talked about on the list before, the bottom line is:

The people who put the party on request that it not be placed on the list for the
simple fact that the "fan out" is too great.  When it is posted on the list it is
in an electronic form that travels to at least 900 people simultaneously around the
world.  These people are capable of sending it to hundreds if not thousands of other
people.  We have experimented both ways with posting to the list and not posting. The
bottom line is that when the party is posted, it increases the number of participants
by generally 1000 people.  The party then generally becomes out of control but not in
a good way.  Many people come because it is the "place to be" not because they want to
experience the magic of a FMR.   The FMR is an _underground_ party.  You have to work to
find it, it's suppose to be that way.  Very often the actual location is not decided
until a couple of hours before the party is to take place.  If the location is posted
earlier in the day or people are informed a day or two in advance, they will be pretty 
disappointed to arrive at a location only to discover that the party has been moved
50 miles away. We don't not post because of the law, indeed there have been some 
indications that the police may have discovered a party or two due to the list but it
is my guess that they saw a print-out or some parent of a friend of a friend who got the
directions e-mailed to them informed the police, I don't believe the police waste their
time and energy monitoring the list looking for parties to bust.

Finding the FMR is suppose to be an adventure,  the party is underground (one of the few 
remaining free underground parties), it has the largest flyer in the solar system,
so you should know the approximate time that it is going to happen, there are many people
on this list who know how to find the info on the full moon, basically the info travels
by phone tree, it is suppose to pass among friends, I suggest that you reach out to people
that you know and get to know them better and you won't have a problem finding the FMR.
Don't bother asking 3 days in advance, the organizers are generally not that organized
that they know the location that early.  It is sort of a spontaneous thing, generally 
I have discovered that a lot of people know the general location by the afternoon before
the party.  Usually by 8 or 9 p.m. it is all over the Haight.

We are trying to keep the party a fun adventure that is enjoyable to the participants
and to the people that put it on.  It is also important that we control the crowd size
so that the location is not completely trashed.


I hope this sheds some light on the subject.

 looked for  my name in the obituary column before writing....However, some
of you know that my poor little black Beemer died last month from
"Raveritis"...that's an indigenous mileage disease that raver cars develop
due to continual party miles.  In my case, my car died, appropriately, on the
way to Sf for a warehouse party.  She went up in flames,(an electrical fire)
after logging 220,000 miles. Not exactly a viking funeral for my car, but
better to "flame out, than rust out"....

 Anyways, I was asleep this last full moon's eve, when friend Forrest comes a
"rap,tap, tapping at my chamber door," calling out---Get Up, Old person, You
Wretched, Arthitic, Poor Excuse for a Rave-Buddy, there's a
FULL.MOON!!!!"......(an those were the nice words he had for me..)

Mark from Ameba had called and said Tracy was spinning at the full moon, and
that our presence was requested...and besides, it was going to be in our neck
of the woods...Panther Beach, Santa Cruz----

So, a full moon, and memories of the Halloween Boony Doon full moon came
flooding back, I remember the beach looking like a patchwork of snowflakes in
the moonlight, ( I think I was seeing things)... as I stumbled to get my rave
warmies on..then,....Driving up the coast....Dutch's Burning Chrome blaring
and pounding away......going in rave style....across the tracks and down to
the party......Spun was playin some very danceable sand music...(did he play
all night???since markie was sick.thanks to him....until Tracy.gave it
whurl... hugs.to her!!!...) I actually left with my legs this time!!!  Great
to see Geoff, Mark, Tracy, Crunch, etc.......
Thanks to all who said hi!!!! or smiled seeing this tall grey-haired raver
with (black Goodman Theater, Chicago Baseball Cap on)....... 
         .....  dancin in the sand   again.....Robertj......monterey......

.........Look for me to back this summer, at a rave near you!!!!!

  A guy with the the Goethe Institute got ahold of me at KALX with some info
on the 'Tuetonic Techno Temple meets SF House' party at DV8 on Wednesday the
21st.  Here goes:

DJ lineup:

SF
---
Markie
Henrik
Robbie Hardkiss
Jon Williams

Germany & elsewhere
--------------------
Marusha
Westbam
Hardsequencer
Jeff Mills
Joey Beltram
Mark Spoon
Patrick Pulsinger
Lester Young
Upstart
Erdem Tunakan
Blake Baxter
Talla 2 XLC
Pascal FEOS
Dr. Motte
Davis Maas

Visuals:

Synergy
Pure
Hyperdelic
Donavan

  They're going to be using all 4 floors of DV8, from 10pm-6am, and the
Gardening Club is also going to do a special ambient installation at the
Caribbean Zone behind DV8.  This is a special event of the 95 'Making Waves:
4th Annual SF Music Day' and the German contribution to the UN-50
celebration.
   For a technohead like me, this is easily the most exciting thing to blow
through town all year!  See you there,

According to the Guardian there will be a "techno Tram driving thru 
various neighborhoods and down Market St. during the day", including a 
1-hour stint at the Safeway at market and duboce at 3pm.   Whee!

following what's happening in SF.
Could you pleased keep me updated on what is going to happen for the 21st.
Many people here would like to know a little bit more about the PLUR and
the summer solstice meeting.

thanks

The moon smiles on us
=====================

When I looked up at the moon last weekend,   it had a big phat smile on
it's face.   I thought that because of this,  maybe we were going to
have a really good FULL MOON party.

It certainly happened,  it literally WENT OFF...

As usual,  I stay home,  next to the Internet,  where I constantly get
updates and news on locations.   However,   Jeff failed to get that info
to me,  so It wasn't until WAY LATE that I actually learned it's SECRET
location.   It was very far from where I lived,   but I eventually made
it to the site.   The site was primo...  reminded me of the old full
moon parties.

When I arrived,  Dutch was spinning some funky house toons,  so I
wandered around,  saying hi to more people that noticed me back.   I
also saw Bruce Eisner there.    As expected,  a LOT of SFRavers were
there,   making the sacrifice of Monday evening to sleep,  and waking up
at 1 am to tune into the grid for loc. inf..

The moon was low on the horizon when we got there,   but the vibe was
primo to the MAX.   Ameba's Mark was dancing just about all the time,
yet another dude with AWESOME ENERGY!!

It wasn't long before the sun rose,   and by that time,  the quantity of
people peaked at about 200.   The crowd size was just about right,
given the limited area,  and the size of the sound system.

Getting the sound system down to the location was a huge monumental task
of dirty manual labor.   But somehow they made it down safely.

As I was tripping around,   the echo effects of the music against the
hillside was an amazing aural experience.

Eventually Tracy went on,  and the music even got better.   WOW!!  Heard
a whole lot of really good stuff..    As usual,  I went totally
insane,  trying to keep up with Mark...   But I also had to devote some
time from dancing to Schmoose and get caught up with the latest juicy
gossip...

Markie never did show up,  reports that he was sick,  and couldn't make
it.   Tracy eventually tired,  and somewhere mid morning,  pulled the
plug.   I could have used about another 8 hours of dancing,   but we had
to settle to just existing in this nice environment.   Late afternoon,
we started out on our trek back.  It was a wonderful and pleasant event
that left the beach and the environment in much better condition than it
was before the gathering.   This one gets a 10 on a one to ten scale,
Way to go Mark!...   You pulled off a good one....

Hey, I'm glad to hear a lot of you enjoyed the full moon.  It
sounded really great and I'm envious of those who got to go.
You know, I don't recall seeing a post for Full Moon.   Did I
just miss it or something???  My mail server has been acting up

To all those getting so exited by the Orb show a few words of warning.
Have any of you lot acctually seen the Orb before?  They don't play live 
(and yes, Techno bands can perform live in just the same way that 
rockbands do they are just using keyboeards, discks and drum machines) 
they just push a few buttons and dance around a bit.  The light and 
vissual show is really good but no better then a good light/slide show 
from Donavn or Synergy.  And the music, especially the last few releases, 
have sucked very badlly indeed.  I just want people who are getting all 
pumped for it only to read mail by lots of dissapointed punters the day after.
(Which I sincerlly hope is not the case!)
  You remember the Galaria show where Orbital played?  Now that was classic 
live techno at it's best.  Orbitall blow the Orb away anyday anyway so 
please don't expect it to be as good as that show.  I have seen the Orb 
three times when I was living in London and the first one was good but 
the other two got progressivly worse.  I am not trying to put a downer on 
the whole issue I just do not want people to be dissapointed.  In short, 
it's not worth $25.  Sorry.
Love Tristan.

 That's Tristan's reply ( thanks Tristan ) ; I'm still waiting for Kevin 
himself to reply , as my original question , as worded , concerned a 
wider concern re: S.P.A.Z. and Kevin's account than just the S.P.A.Z.
tour information....

				- traditional wiccan rhyme




	The universe operates on two governing principles,
	one is Reason,
	the other is Rhyme
	which is very close to rhythm

	Our culture is fixated on Reason,
	The Sea is fixated on Rhyme,

	This last full moon was truly stupendous for me.
	The night started early, Markie called me earlier in the
	day and said "it's on" though the exact location was not finalized
	until the evening.  By 2:00 a.m. I was cruising over the Santa Cruz 
	mountains in my hoopty of a CRX, the cell-phone rings, it's Markie
	telling me he's too sick to come and play (and boy does he sound it :)
	He say's that Chaulkie may show up but that if not, Spun and Tracy
	have to make it on their own. Oh well.  Behind me, in another
	car, is my friend Mellissa, this is her first FMR in about two years
	having almost completely dropped out of the scene, she is accompanied
	by Jessica (an old timer though she is only 19 :) and another friend
	who is about to go to her first Rave (and boy is she in for a treat :)

	We arrive in Santa Cruz, drive through the town and out to the 
	cool and the dark,  I find the appropriate hidden turn off and discover
	that there are quite a few cars already at the site, though it isn't 
	over crowded.  I find a good place to park, take out my back-pack and
	my new instrument, a didgery-do (sp?) and start the descent of the cliff
	The night is beautiful, the Moon is shining in a clear sky, the
	reflection on the sea is almost otherworldly.  This is the full moon
	before the Solstice, the most powerful full moon of the year.  As far
	as one's ability to trance and to "bridge the worlds" this is a most
	auspicious time. Perhapse that is why a certain Kind Soul choose this
	time to bless several of us with a drop or two of an absolute sacrement

	The beach was in full effect,  It was about 3:15 when the music started,
	Spun at the helm, starts off with some ambient music to set the tone and
	to dissapate some of the alcohol energy that was prominant. As
	he goes along I take some moments out to walk along the beach, the
	ultimate chill-out room, I go over by the cliff and sit up on the rocks
	playing my didgery-do to the surf.  As the music picks up, I decide that
	it's time to dance but as I do go back over to the  speakers, I began
	to experience the full on rush. I climbed up out of the beach and
	walked along the the top of the cliff, the top had been tilled
	and planted with some form of leafy green vegetable.  The whole country
	side was bathed in moonlight and it gave a silvery sheen to the
	ground and the plants.  As I walked closer to the edge I looked out and 
	saw the ocean in all it's magnificent beauty and power.  Initially, it
	was frightening, (I was up pretty high, I could look out for miles
	and the sea was so vast and some of the waves off shore were easily 
	about 30 feet in hight) as I watched, I became less afraid and realized
	the the sea has a story to tell and a song to sing, and if you listen
	carefully you can hear it.  I grew bolder and went out to the very edge 
	of the cliff, to a little power spot "between the worlds" it jutted
	out and was not more than 12 feet wide but it provided a place to stand
	or sit where you could see all of panther beach below on one side and 
	all of the  coast on the other.  As I looked down on the revellers
	and looked out into the sea, I began to realize that what we were doing
	was not particularly new at all but, in actuality it is _very_ old,
	cratures, especially sea creatures are very linked to the lunar cycle,
	and at the full moon there is more activity then at any other time.  As
	I watched the incessant approach of the waves, I finally understood
	about music and rhythm, House music in particular.  We as a species
	have a long way to go when it comes to rhythm, things like raving and
	trance dancing are just at the gate of remembrance so to speak. The sea
	and the creatures that inhabit her are far more "with it" when it comes
	to this fact of life.  At one point when Tracy  had come on, her playing
	was perfectly in sync with the rhythm of the approaching waves that
	were pounding the coast for miles in both directions, the sound of
	the music blended with the sound of the waves like an intricate fractal,
	I could feel the energy on the beach, some one screamed and then I 
	realized the lesson that our mother, the sea, was trying to tell us.

	For the sea, all there is, is Rhythm, it is the governing principle
	of ocean life, the currents and the tides are rhythmic and repetitive,
	although the song changes from hour to hour, month to month, season to
	season, eon to eon.  When we rave for 4, 5 or 8 hours we simulate 
	something that has been going on in the sea for millions of years,
	it will continue to go on for millions of years more even though we
	have to stop and do things like electronic funds transactions and
	building Web sites,  there is always a Full Moon Rave at the seashore
	whether we bring our sound boxes or not.  The sea calls to us and 
	invites us to return to the perpetual party, to the perpetual rhythm
	of her song, for some of us, (dolphins, wales) the call was so 
	inviting that we did return and remerged our lives with hers, we forgot
	what it was to "build" and make tools and reverted back to the Vibe.
	As I stood up there I could see whole weather systems come in from off
	shore, great clouds of moisture coupled with large wind-swept waves
	would roll in to the beach and the Vibe of the beach wiuld get moist
	and soggy and wet, the music would even change, but eventually it would
	drain out and and the Vibe would change again, it made me wonder about
	mood and temperment and Vibe and how much of this is generated by
	us or are we just responding to greater natural forces.  Humans are
	so vain, we think that because we are on the top of the food chain
	that that is tantamount to divinity, but it is not.  As I sat up on the
	cliff, it was almost as if the wild plants and rocks and the very shore
	around me began to speak, but not in words, more like a type of Jazz
	(or at least what Jazz is an attempt at), The conversation was sorta 
	like:
		"Hey bro, you finally come round to hang huh?"
		"Those be your people down there? That's kool, they seem kool"
		"Yeah we was checkin you all out, you be the new plankton 
		in these parts?"
		"Say what? You not plankton?, Yeah, well you be usin that 
		phospholuminescent shit, we figured you be plankton"
		"Yeah, that little sista down there, who she be?"
		"Trace-E? oh oh Tracy"
		 Yeah,she be  catchin the groove now...,
		pretty kool, yeah she got it now..., 
		"we be tryin to tell your tribe that for a while now
		good thing your gettin it."

		I had my didgery-do with me, the locals said:

		"Can you Play?" 
		"What?"
		"you Play, can you Play?"
		I make a feable attempt at playing my Didge, the sound
		resonates with the morning sunrise.
		"Yeah, that's kool, you`ll get it" (being kind :)
		"OK we Play now..."

		I listen to the sound of crashing waves, flying insects
		and calling birds and realize that all of life vibrates
		in around and through us, Tracy is throwing down some serious
		beats below on the beach, I wonder if she realizes how
		tuned in she really is.  Anyone can learn to be a DJ, many
		can become great and accomplished but very few can gain the
		ability to set aside their Ego and let Creation play through
		them, that what makes a DJ into a Shaman or Shamaness :)

		As I bid fairwell to my plant friends they invited me back,
		"Don't worry, we'll be here tomorrow and the next day, century
		and milenium. Party every night"

		If this is an indication of the summer to come it will be
		a good one.  Tracy, who played for 4 hours straight has come
		into her own and has shown the way for many of us.  The Wicked
		boys should be proud of their protege.

Recently, Susie Kameny asked about a pre-Orb get together:

> susie (:

 Sounds good to me! Is Tulan a big restaurant , or a coffeeshop , or ???
If you are facing the Warfield, is it on the right or left? When , 7:30PM
or sooner/later ?

Recently , Tristan posted a consumer warning about the upcoming Orb show:

 Many folks on SFRaves have seen the Orb the last time they came to San
Francisco , and they mostly gave it positive reviews , as I remember.
For myself, I don't need a dynamic stage show or lights. Hearing their
music LOUD on a better speaker system than my home stereo system is
another plus point for me.

 IMHO, I like their most recent release just fine , so I don't think
the concert will be very much of a disappointment for me ...
it'll be my first Orb concert .

Well, granted The ORB really isnt playin' live (just read your lates issue of
Keybord magazine). But still, isn't it (going, that is) for the experiance?
 I'm really not too hip to any techno bands, but, hey it's not The Orb that
will make it a memeorable experience in itself.  But you, dear ravers, and
the vibes that you bring.....

till then,

I've seen um before.  They played a huge, I mean huge mixing board,
turntables, and a set of conga drums (maybe a few other instruments, but I
was so out of my mind I can't remember).

I've seen Orbital twice, and each time all they did (for the most part) was
punch buttons on a mixing board.  They rarely touched the keyboards.  They
still kick ass though.  

I thought the Orb was great live or DAT, and I have no problem shelling out
$25 to see them. 

Just trying to balance out the vibe with a contrary opinion.

currently live in Indiana. Would anyone like to fill me in on the scene. 
Please, if anyone is interested in educationing a fellow raver I would 
appreciate it. I don't know anyone in the Bay area that is connected to 
the rave scene so I need to know as much as possible. I could tell you 
a lot about the scene in the midwest. Thanks.

1)i, and i'm sure, many others on this list have seen the Orb before. 
2)although Pommes Fritz sucked, the new album is most certainly worthy. 
try listening to it.
3)over 2/3 of the reviews i've read from people on the net have been 
good ones. if you read any of the electronic/dance music lists not only 
will you know the set list by now and the order they'll play the songs 
in, but what each one sounds like.
4)i don't think anyone is going to this show under false pretenses. 
5)it's $20. 
just getting things straightened out. Sorry.

The whole POINT of going to see the Orb is to have the experience with 2000
people who also enjoy them.  I know they're not going to be up there waving
guitars and inviting girls from the audience to dance on stage.  But
neither does Dub Tribe, and I see no one slagging their concerts for being
a lot of knob-twiddling.  I don't think anyone is going with any of the
sort of illusions you seem to feel are running rampant ... at least, not
here in Vancouver.

As for the last few releases sucking, well, maybe for those who don't like
this sort of extremely esoteric musical experimentation.  I only heard
Pomme Fritz for the first time last weekend myself, the reason being that a
lot of people I know said it was awful, so I hadn't bothered.  I discovered
an incredible mixture of weird and wonderful layers that wove over and
around itself in amazing and lovely ways.  So nyah, I liked it!!!!

ANYWAYS .. that's my little spark for the day.  see y'all.

Karen's points are exactly why most people are going to the show.
Also, on the issue of Pomme Fritz and FFWD: I got these two releases
when they came out and really like both of them, and am not sure
how much of the dislike around is based on actual listening 
experience.  The new album though is fantastic, as is the
new remix single.  

See you at the show,

Mohsen

Jeez, an I thought you were turning a positive leaf after the full moon.

Last time I saw the Orb they were pretty incredible, and while some stuff
may have been off DAT they put a lot of work into their live show with
massive reworkings of recorded versions and tremendous visuals. Whether the
last few releases have sucked is a matter of opinion. I actually like
Pommes Frites and some of the Oxbow Lakes mixes. Haven't decided yet on
O.T. Regardless, the versions they're likely to play live will be wildly
different from the album versions.

And the show's $20, not $25...

Joe

     (fyi, bsp and sorry for the use of bandwidth)
     
     dust and digital truth are hosting alex paterson and dj lewis keogh at 
     a special warehouse party in the city after they play the Warfield on 
     Friday June 16th.  Tickets are $7 apiece.  The party should run from 
     11:30 p.m. - 7:00 a.m.
     
     Other djs include Jon Williams, Carlos and John Carel.
     
     There are a limited amount of tickets at Ameba and Reckless Records, 
     both on the Haight in the city.
     
     Because of the location (i.e. a private warehouse) we won't be able to 
     let anyone in without a ticket.  Our vmail number i.e. 415.536.9453 
     will have more information.
     
     Thanks for all the inquiries and interest.  We hope to see plenty of 
     sf-ravers at this party which I think will be super.
     
     Cheers.

Well, that's just fine, Tristan.  Don't waste your time going to the

I just came to SF area a couple of weeks ago (live in London) and this
FMR was my First Real Meeting with Pacific Ocean and all that; so I
thought it must have been me: FMR couldn't be THAT AMAZING!

It's good to hear that other people actually shared shared the same
feeling: FMR WAS that amazing.

Mark and Tracy did a seriously great job. Tracy went on and on and on,
as if in some kind of understanding with those big slow waves.

Thanks to all,
-- Dusko

(I don't think FMRs would be better if they were bigger or easier to
access. A couple of guys stood and laughed at a dancer, until she put
on a sweater. How do you filter them out on a beach?)

The Orb is the big show this weekend; I think tickets are still available.
Also in town this weekend are Little Louie Vega (at Sound Factory), Joeski
(at Progress), jazz DJs Raphael and Takemura (at the On the One party), Moby 
at the Trocadero, and lots of European DJs at Wednesday's Making Waves 
festival and party (Teutonic Techno Temple).  Finally, the Gay/Lesbian Pride
parade has lots of floats with techno and house :)

Props to the Dust crew for going out with a bang last Friday, and the Friends
and Family crew for a great outdoor sol y luna party last Saturday...

Ah, but what buttons!  :)  Actually, according to posts on the idm list, 
they are indeed using a wide array of samplers, keyboards, tape loops, 
etc.  They also play for a *long* time this round supposedly, 2 hours or 
something.

Not to diminish any of it of course :)

Actually I was incredibly surprised by Orbus Terrarum - very rich in 
textures, very clean sound, very melodic.  They got their ya-ya's out 
with Pommes Frites, I think.

Actually, people have been posting to the ambient and idm lists about the 
orb shows, and the vast majority have been positive (though a few 
negative of course).  You can read them in the archives on hyperreal.

Ahhh-
	But when alex came to Stirling Uni a year and a half ago, he sat 
beyond all his little toys and cranked out some really good tracks, most 
of which I haven't heard on anything that has been released (now, a year 
later). There was no I-push-this-one-button-and-look-what-comes-out-
while-I-dance-round-for-a-bitness to his set then.

The Orb and "Orbital" are not the same band. (judging by post people were 
confused)  Orbital did Pome Fritz.  As far as I know there is only two
 original albums by the Orb available in 
this country.  My real thing I have about the Orb (and I don't disslike 
them, I am listening to Towers of Dub as I write) is that they do not 
write or perform all there stuff; they get in many outside writers and 
musicans such as Steve Hillage and Jah Wobble.  NOthing wrong with that 
you might say but I am old school and music that has only been made and 
produced the band themselves somehow has more sicerity asbout it then 
committee music.  This is one of the reasons I really like Orbital.  BUt 
that's just my own personal thang.
Tristan.
PS.  Please all have a good time.

	Ummm.... looking at my copy of pomme fritz, it's an Orb album. (Brought
'em all to work to listen to today).  Four available in the US, not counting
the singles (Little Fluffy Clouds, etc.).

	Given that many techno artists go out of their way to disguise their
identity (I'm thinking Basic Channel, the thread on idm).  What difference does
it make if the people involved change periodically, as long as the general 
'sound' is the same?

take good care of it,

somehow my response to this bit of Tristans letter did not get sent.  I 
have heard an Orb album that is suppose to be live.  One particular 
song, "little fluffy clouds" sounded live to me.  It was like the 
studio version but had that "live" sound to it.  Dont know the name of 
the album but it is yellow and has a lamb floating over a factory on 
it.  I'm sure most of you know which one I'm talking about.

I don't think the Orb call creating a song "writing" so much as "getting 
really stoned with a bunch of friends and jamming on anything that would 
make a noise" :)   It's not new or unique, but yeah, Orbital probably 
deserve the moniker "songwriters" more.  But it really doesn't matter to 
me.

I've always suspected it...you really *don't* know what you are talking 
about.  The ORB did Pomme Fritz. Check hyperreal for complete discogs for 
both the Orb and Orbital

The Orb has several disks you can find in the states...
Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld
UFORB
Pomme Fritz
Orbus Terranus
		as far as LPs go
many many singles
including 
Oxbow Lakes
Little Fluffy Clouds
Perpetual Dawn (may be hard to find)
and there have been about 5 other singles released in the US that would 
be pretty hard to find these days...(assassin (2 cd's) blue room (2 cd's) 
compactdisco(forget the right name...huge ever growing pulsating brain maybe)

So, according to Tristan, Orbital did "Pome Fritz".  Hate to say it, but
you're wrong on both counts -- wrong band, wrong spelling.  I'm not very
concerned about the spelling, of course.

Tristan, I just don't know what to say to you.  The more you post, the
less sense you make.

I love the work both the Orb and Orbital have done.  They've both worked
with many outside musicians, producers and what-have-you.  They both put
on renowned live shows.  I'll leave it to others to argue whether either
group does more "live" stuff on stage, both do enough to satisfy me
they're not just hand-synching :-)  

enjoy the show everyone, I'm looking forward to seeing Dr Patterson and
the crew here in Portland on Monday . . .

Hi! I'm a new SFRaver and Just finished final exams, so I'll be raving 
ALL summer! =)  Starting at Sankofa.  I just started subscribing to this 
mailing list a few weeks ago.  If anyone is going to Sankofa I would love 
to meet more sfravers.  I'm a 5'4" asian female, with straight hair half 
way down to my back.  hmm... I'm average weight and I'll probably be 
wearing a white t-shirt and jeans.  Oh to make it easier, I'll wear a 
sticker on my t-shirt.  =)  I know doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but 
I really don't know how to describe myself =).  Hope to meet some of you 
guys there.
10 hours away from my last final exam
stressed
Monique

Well , no replies to Susie Kameny's idea about meeting at Tulan , but
my wife Mary and I will be there anyway - we'll try to be there by 7:30PM.
I'll be wearing a faded red "SFR" cap , for ID purposes. I'll be wearing 
it at the ORB show too , so say hello if you see me!

The Orb is not even going on stage until midnight and the whole show is
slated to go until 4am...maybe they're not coming by this party until
afterwards?

At first I was going to make an informed correction as well, but seeing as
this is turning into a full on gang-flame, I think I'll sit back...

Careful sfravers, your resentments are showing! I knew y'all had it in ya...

 Hi all -

 What are people's recommendations for parking for events at the
Warfield? I know there's a parking lot behind the Warfield , but
will it be open all night, and can I pull out my vehicle if I
want to leave before 4am?

 I was also thinking of parking in a residential neighborhood, and
catching a taxi .

There is a big parking garage on Mission St that is within walking

best (and usually cheapest) bet for Warfield parking is the city run 
garage at 5th and mission - it's only a block and a half from the
warfield - there is a small parking lot in back of the warfield
and another lot on golden gate - about a block away - actually, 
come to think of it the 5th & mission lot may be more expensive than
one of the lots close to the warfield - you have to pay by the hour,
compared to one flat fee - anyway hope to meet you there!

Psychic TV was known for its many varied incarnations as well, from just
Genesis, Paula and Fred to full horn sections and all that. groups like
these benefit from the input of different musicians when different
influences are sought. the audience always benefits from this. 
looking forward to the show...

It's kinda iffy. I have always managed to find parking right around the 
fire station, which I consider to be a bit safer too, considering it is 
manned 24 7.... But the taxi idea would probably be much easier.

Sfravefriends,

	I am glad to be back with you again. Now being electronically 
hooked up from home rather than remotely, I hope to be a more regular 
contributor to the list.  Reading some of the recent posts, I was struck 
by some of what Geoff White wrote in his beautiful account of the Full 
Moon Rave at Panther Beach:


According to my server, on Thursday, 15 Jun 1995, Geoff White shared:

It seems to me that Geoff is alluding to several dichotomies when he 
writes of reason and rhyme:  man and nature, science and magic, logic and 
intuition, the brain and the heart/soul, the knowable and the unknowable.

But it also seems to me that these divisions are ones that we ourselves 
create.  As humans learn ever more about the nature of the universe and 
its creatures by means of our improving technology and accumulated 
understanding, the unfamiliar, the strange, the mysterious, loses for us 
some of its wonder and mystery.

Imagine if you will an Ohlone tribesman several hundred years ago taking 
part in a full moon celebration with native drums on Panther Beach, and 
standing on the very cliff Geoff White stood on last Monday evening.  How 
different his attitude toward the sea, not knowing that one day men would 
fly over it in airplanes, mine oil from its depths, sail under it in 
submarines, study the details of its creatures in aquariums, and relate 
the monthly and seasonal ebb and flow of its tides to the cycles of the 
moon and the patterns of ocean currents?  To the Ohlone it might have 
been a vast, frightening, beautiful, religious experience, a stretch of 
water of untold depth and unmeasured vastness, like space to us, populated 
with the Great Spirit only knows what alien creatures?

Thankfully, this romantic amd intensely spiritual view of the ocean may 
still be experienced by us of course, especially when we are in moods such 
as Geoff's.  However we will not have as easy a time of it, because we 
will inevitably be distracted by thoughts of Japanese cargo ships and 
weather monitoring satelites.  Because these things are familiar to us, 
and related to the "boring" world of media, commerce, contemporary 
culture and material things, we perceive them as non-magical.  I think 
this perception is a mistake.  The intricacies of how such things as the 
tides function in accordance with the laws of nature should be cause for wonder 
and appreciation for both the things themselves and the science by which 
they have become known to us, not a blind mysticism that worships nature 
and holds man and civilization in contempt.

Geoff's experience at Panther Beach was, I would guess, made more 
beautiful and memorable for him by many factors, among them:

-The sound system (perhaps carried at one point on a Japanese cargo 
	ship?) and music made possible by modern technology
-The contrast of the scene with his everyday, presumeably urban and 
	largely indoors existance, a facet of modern society
-Possibly the imbibing of one or more substances discovered through 
	modern pharmacology
-The knowledge that he would be able to share it later with the rest of 
	us by means of the net, a product of modern technology
-The fact that he (presumeably) reached the site swiftly by automobile, 
	in comfort, as opposed to trekking for many miles as the Ohlone might 
	have done...

Let's not put ourselves down.  Modern man is part of nature, and so too our 
constructions are part of nature, not in opposition to it.  The 
more we learn, the more that we learn there is left to learn, thus as our 
knowledge of science and the workings of the universe increases, so 
should increase our wonder and awe at its magic.  

The scientific is magical, and the magical has scientific explanations.  
Intuitively, I let logic guide me, and sometimes logic tells me I should 
rely on my intuition.  The heart is an organ that pumps blood, so where does 
the real "heart" or soul of each of us lie in the body if not in the 
intricacies of our brain?  When we say "mind" and "heart" and "soul", are we 
unknowingly refering to different aspects of the very same thing, like 
the blind men examining the elephant?  As for the knowable and the 
unknowable, mathematics has proven the existance of a fourth dimension, 
and mathematicians have designed representations of four-dimensional cubes, 
but from what I have heard, you can look at one and not understand it.  
We all use mundane objects such as pencils, but not one of us could make 
a #2 pencil from scratch, or even give the details of the process by 
which one is made.  Perhaps all things are individually knowable, but the 
interconnectedness of things, the big picture, is ultimately unknowable 
save by God, if such a creature exists.

I say surely if there is a Supreme Being, in such a being rhyme and 
reason would be united.  If we aspire to divinity, or at least earthly 
bliss and enlightenment, I think we must also try to achieve such a 
unity.  Some people may prefer the left or the right brain, but none of 
us can survive with half a brain.  I say embrace that which increases our 
ability to shape our environment, to know more about the universe, and to 
"do the impossible," without sacrificing our appreciation for the part of 
nature not created by humans and our delight at taking part in simple 
primitive pleasures such as dancing on the beach under the full moon.  
I want people to enjoy movies without forgetting it took a film crew, 
a director, lights, cameras, and much more to make them.  To lose 
themselves in the experience of the Pirates of the Carribean, and then 
afterwards be able to marvel at the imagination and ingenuity of its 
creators.  Leave the dichotomies behind, and we can have the best of both 
worlds.  Or, as a famous man who was both scientist and artist might have 
put it...

	"Plunged in his study of the problem of transmission of power by 
	means of blocks and levers, Leonardo (da Vinci) had forgotten the 
	machine.  He had just finished a complicated calculation.  The inner 
	necessity of reason, i.e. the law of mathematics, justified the outer 
	necessity of nature, i.e. the law of mechanics; two great secrets 
	blended into a single one that was still greater...

	"In his soul was that familiar emotion of reverent amazement 
	before the abyss into which he was peering -- an emotion which 
	has no similarity with any of the other emotions within the ken
	of man.  On the margins, alongside of the plan for the machine...
	alongside of the figures and calculations, he wrote down the 
	words which resounded in his heart like a prayer:

	"'O, that admirable justice of thine, Thou Prime Mover! To no force
	hast Thou denied the order and ability of its necessary effects; 
	inasmuch as, if it be supposed to move a body for a hundred
 	ells, and it meet an obstacle in its path, Thou hast ordained 	
	that the force of the impact produce new motion, receiving as 
	compensation for the untraversed distance divers jolts and shocks --
	oh, Thy divine necessity, Thou Prime Mover -- thus dost Thou compel
	with Thy laws all effects to flow out of the cause in the 
	shortest course. *There* is a miracle!'"

	-from "The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci" by Dmitri Merezhkovsky

If you have to, take BART to the Civic Center station. You're almost next
to it at that point when you come out of the station.

                     Little Red Raver Girl
                            by
                      Noah "juggler" Lee
              (respect to the original of course)


[ed's note: This evolved from a trip to Albuquerque for the Orbital X
rave. We had to keep ourselves entertained on the four hour drive with
no radio or tape deck. Gotta do something!!]


   Once upon a time, cuz, heck, what better time than that, there lived
Little Red Raver Girl. She was a happy little girl who loved to wear
baggy overalls and the grooviest striped shirts. Her red pigtails and
keen shoes could charm the Blow-Pop (tm) out of any raver's mouth.

   Well, it seems that Little Red Raver Girls's promoter grandmother was
not feeling so hot cuz an event she was throwing wasn't going so great.
Little Red Raver Girl decided to take a skippity trip over to her grand-
ma's house to deliver some lollipops, a new whistle, and a hit of X. She
only wanted Grandma Promoter to feel better. :)

   Little Red Raver Girl set out into the scary city with a warning from
her tired out hippy mother, who warned her of the evils of the world. As
usual it went in one ear and out the other. Little Red Raver Girl only
wanted peaz and unity and didn't like to hear about the bad people out
there because they gave off such bad vibes.

  Hippity, trippy skipping down the avenue whistling some housy, funky
toon, Little Red Raver Girl hardly noticed the Big Bad Gothic Girl come
out of the shadows of an alley.

"Whoa!" said Little Red Raver Girl, "You put quite a fright into me!"

"Yeah, whats new?" angrily replied the Big Bad Gothic Girl.

"Hey, you wanna sticker? I got heart stickers!! Or how about a
lollipop?" asked Little Red Raver Girl.

"Nah, I don't want no stinking lollipop," gothically replied Big Bad
Gothic Girl. "Where you think you're headed to in this dark, cold,
miserable world of ours??"

"Well," said Little Red Raver Girl, "i'm off to see Grandma Promoter
to deliver some goodies so she can be happy and throw the phattest event
this side of the world."

"Big event eh?" interestingly replied Big Bad Gothic Girl. She thought
to herself, "Hmmmm....you know I bet if I get those goodies I could
throw a dark, scary event the way I want it."

"Well, I best be off now. Peace, love and unity to you Ms. Gothic Girl."

"Uhh...yeah, sure."

And Little Red Raver Girl was off. But so was Big Bad Gothic Girl.
Seeing as how she hung out in dark alleys all night she happened to know
a shortcut to Grandma Promoter's warehouse. She sped ahead to beat
Little Red Raver Girl there.

[here's a plot twist in the story! Oooooohhhh!!!]

Little Red Raver Girl continued on her way wondering why someone would
paint their face chalk white and wear all black clothing on such a
beautiful day. Just as she was daytripping this she ran into a funky
phresh young man stepping from a record store.

"Yowza!" exclaimed Little Bloo DJ Guy, "Sorry about the bumping action
there."

"Oh excuse me! I wasn't watching where I was going. Would you like a
sticker? A lollipop?"

"Yeah! Sure! Thanks a lot!"

"Here ya go," said Little Red Raver Girl as she stuck on a groovy frog
sticker onto Little Bloo DJ Guy's chest. She hands him a lollipop and
asks, "Are you a DJ by any chance?"

"I certainly am! In fact i'm supposed to be spinning later at Grandma
Promoters event. You going??"

"Yesssss!!! I'm her granddaughter! I'm Little Red Raver Girl! I bet you
are Little Bloo DJ Guy then!" exclaimed she. Quite a good guess too
seeing as how he had on a bloo hoody shirt with "Bloo DJ" in holographic
type on it. She's quite the quick witted one ya know. :)

"Yep! That's me! I'm sooo happy to meet you! Hey, I gotta run but i'm
going over to Grandma Promoter's Houze of Funky Toons for the Pre-Party,
so I hope I see you there," said Little Bloo DJ Guy.

"You sure will. Be seeing you later!" happily exclaimed Little Red Raver
Girl. And off went Little Bloo Dj Guy. Little Red Raver Girl breathed
a sigh, for Little Bloo DJ Guy was sooo sweet and just the nicest guy
she had met in the longest time. She really wanted to hear him spin
and get to know him better. "Maybe at the pre-show," she excitedly
thought.

[Meanwhile...]

   Back at Grandma Promoter's Houze of Funky Toons, the bass was
bumping as Grandma prepared for the rave and was stressing hard getting
ready for the show. Then, all of a sudden a "ding, dong, boom boom boom"
came from her specially designed doorbell.

"Who is it??" asked Grandma Promoter.

"Tis me! Little Red Raver Girl" replied a slightly gruff and not quite
happy voice.

"I best let her in to help me and cheer her up. She sounds as bad as
I do!" thought Grandma Promoter to herself and opened the door.

As soon as she had in leaped Big Bad Gothic Girl and she quickly tied
up Grandma Promoter in a extra long pair of fishnet stockings and
handcuffed her to the sink in the bathroom with her handcuff belt.

"You can't do this! It doesn't promote peace and unity!" cried Grandma
Promoter. "Lemme go and i'll hook you up with a hit of X and you can
dance all night with us and feel the groove. I guarantee you'll feel
better."

"Nice try grandma. Stuff it," and Big Bad Gothic Girl promptly
crammed a black candle into Grandma Promoter's mouth to quiet her down.
She then went on to change the music to something much less happy and
got into some of Grandma's  clothes. "Ick...these are soooo bright and
happy. I think i'll throw up."

At just about the time she was done there came a sound in the warehouse,
"ding, dong boom boom boom."

"Yeah, who is it??" asked Big Bad Gothic Girl who was now dressed like
Grandma Promoter.

"It's me!! Little Red Raver Girl!!" came the reply. "Let me in Grandma!
We need to change that music and make you feel phresh!"

Big Bad Gothic Girl opened the door and let Little Red Raver Girl in.

"Why Grandma! What a pale, icky, clammy white face you have!" said
Little Red Raver Girl.

"The better to scare you with my dear." came the reply.

"Why Grandma! What morbid, black fingernails you have!" exclaimed Little
Red Raver Girl.

"The better to scratch off your face with you little happy hippie wanna
be!!" yelled Big Bad Gothic Girl and she LEAPED from her baggies and
pounced on Little Red Raver Girl.

Just at that moment the door swung open and in sped Little Bloo DJ Guy
with his patented Bag O' DJ Music. He rapidly threw on the phattest of
toons and started spinning and cutting it up as best as he could.

As he did this, a strange feeling overcame Big Bad Gothic Girl. She
felt a pumping bass shaking her body. She felt a warmth overcome her
entire soul. She wanted to stop almost, but she couldn't help herself
from getting up off of Little Red Raver Girl and dance. She got down.
She boogied. She threw massive moves. Little Red Raver Girl rushed to
the john and freed Grandma Promoter. They went out to the dancefloor
right as a large crowd had gathered at the door. The pre-party was in
full effect and at the heart of it was Big Bad Gothic Girl dancing
everyone into amazement. She gave everyone a hug and some a kiss she
felt so good. The vibe was the best they had ever felt that night.
Grandma's event went off like never before and was of legend promoter
proportions. Little Bloo Dj Guy spun his best set and fell deeply in
love with Little Red Raver Girl to everyones happiness.

And they lived happily ever after.

T h e  E n d.

For those wishing to connect my body with my postings, I will be:

1) tall
2) with long hair pulled back, samurai-style
3) wearing my Marvin the Martian t-shirt and
4) funky one-leg-red, one-leg-yellow long shorts
5) at the dinner also unless events intervene

ObRave: I would like to echo Geoff's sentiments.  Though I was not
at Panther Beach that night, I know (I think) the experience he
describes, of being really aware of the moment and one's surroundings.
We-as-humans have been walking the earth for thousands of generations,
and we-as-animals (there is no sharp line, here) for millions more.
The rhythms of moon, sun, season, and a thousand other things we have
forgotten are deeply imbedded in our consciousness.
	When we step out of our concrete, metal, stone, and tin boxes
(how often do you see box shapes in nature?) and really _see_ our
surroundings, the glow of recognition is palpable.  Clouds, sand, dirt,
plants, animals, we know these.  We have known them for hundreds of
millions of years.  Cars, buildings, roads, cops, televisions, we don't
know these.  We are like kids playing with matches; we have no experience
or understanding of them.
	Sure, we can intellectualize about techno-toys, their
effect on us, why we have them, but we are not, fundamentally, logical
animals.  Our visceral understanding of them is limited to their intersection
with experiences we already know, and we mistake the representation (TV,
movies, concerts) for the lived experience (dancing, making music, love, the
hunt).
	We _know_ all-night dance orgies, from way back.  Waaaaay back.
It's that pesky superego getting in our way, usually constructed by other
overintellectualized types to make us serve their representational desires
(more money, more stuff, a false sense of control over entropy), that keeps
us on the fringes, afraid to jump in the fire and get down with the demons
of your subconscious.
	You've got a big hindbrain.  Don't be afraid to use it >%^)

I hate to rag on anybody, who knows maybe Tristan is just having a really 
bad day...8-).  Anyway, I nominate tristan the official "little fluffy 
cloud" of SfRaves...perhaps the title will make Tristan research the Orb 
and Orbital a little better.

I hear that yes, there will be a Sunset this Sunday and it will become a 
regular weekly thing the rest of the summer.  My first rave was a Sunset 
a couple of months ago and I can't think of a better way to spend a 
Sunday afternoon.  So if any of you see me there on Sunday with red hair 
and a Rottweiler named Jake, come say "HI".

back into "rave"!

Well as most everyone's excitement lies in seeing the Orb, my excitement 
is going to Sunset this Sunday!
I don't know about the Bay Area, but Sacramento's skies have begun to 
clear up real nice, so maybe my freverant and desperate hoping may have 
done some good.  Maybe I'll perform some more sun rituals and dances to 
assure nice weather for Sunday. ;) 
Now I have to just cross my fingers that Sunset won't be too far to 
drive from Sacramento.  I've been looking forward to this for almost a 
month now, and I'd just die if it were held in Santa Cruz. :(  I'm also 
bringing 5 people along *with* me - 6 of us crammed into the raver 
wagon!  One of the people (who is toting his conga drum) has never been 
to any kind of rave event, so I thought a nice free Sunset saturated with great 
vibe will be a good first.  Doncha think so? :) 

So then for those of you sfravers how have not yet met me, I am about 
5'6" with long straight reddish-brown hair.  If it's nice and warm (pleez 
pleez) I'll be wearing my lavendar overall shorts.  Please come and say 
hi, I adore meeting fellow sfravers and their friends!  

giddy with anticipation,
Amy

Howdy all y'all-

     There's an outdoor party planned for this saturday...although a site 
is "available" we're looking for a recommendation for a "bust-free" 
environment. (Preferrably in the North Bay or East Bay).

     Please e-mail privately to: jwpjr@netcom.com

     Much obliged and hope to see you there...

Do you consider my "electro" DJ name in bad taste?
 I will be spinning at CHAOS 415.552.2398 sat 17th

My take on the electro revival is: Some funky attempts at drum programming 
were made under the guise "electro". After a long period of trying to mix 
trance and disco, I realised that its more fun to mix electro and techno. I grew 
up in Mountain View and  the electro vibe cruised the El Camino Real in low 
trucks.When I heard that bass, I was always concerned that my ass was about 
to be kicked.

On listening to LTJ Bukem's "Horizons" release again this week, I was
completely captivated by the vocal fragment on this track.  Consider
this if you think jungle isn't worth bothering with:

    Each new hour
    holds new chances
    for new beginnings.

    The horizon leans forward
    offering you space to place
    new steps of change.

Hello Everybody,
	Well, I want to know how the Orb went, but I know that I will 
have to wait until later to find out. Also, I wanted to know what 
happened at Sancofa(I don't know if I spelled it right!) Anyways, I just 
wanted to wish everyone a good morning, and to have a beautiful 
saturday. Also, if you happened to be one of those people that sent me 
mail in the past week, please send it again or call me, cause I was 
having problems with my account again, and had to erase all my messages 
before I could read them! Well, I need to go to sleep now!

Greg :)


Ps. I am really sorry about what happened last weekend with the MESS- 
Cloud Factory- Harmony party. Especially for those of you who came from 
far away! We will make it up to you!!! (Just wait!!!) I think we are 
going to be doing a party real soon!

Here I am, still on my visit in LA.  Got back a little while ago from a 
rave called nectar.  Great party!  Thank you socal-ravers who recommended 
it to me.
Things sure have turned around for me on this trip after having a ruff 
start.  Got a good dose of traffic, pouring rain, and a $55 parking ticket.
Enuff said about that stuff.
This party started at 3am, music and sound system were great.  A little 
different set up from the usual sf partys.  Rather than having most of 
the people facing the dj, here the dj was off to the side, and most of 
the people dancing were facing this wall of speakers.
Is this typical at LA partys?
This party had a nice vibe, no separate chill out music, but some spaces 
to chill out away from the dance floor with fantasia being shown on the wall.
It was great to share some of the beautiful energy at this party.
Its nice to see the sun shining today, hope its like that in sf, where 
i'm going to try and make it to the sunset party.
Hope everyone who went to the orb show in sf had a great time.  It 
sounded like the orb had quite a show down here.
speak to you all later, got to get some breakfast.


;)

Well I'd have to say that The Orb was one of the bestest concerts Ive been to
in a while.  The Visuals, the peoples, THe dance floor (If you could call it
that ;).

I don't think words are ness. to express the musical majick that transposed
that lovely friday night.....   
The traceable factor was so, that I caught that natural high vibe and am
thankful ti will be one of thoese memories that'll will be kept intact (un
like the many, many fragmented memories of other raves...).

The only down side would be that I'd assume The Warfield would be better
equipped on the H2O front.  I mean seriously out of water b-4 midnite?

Fun Factor:

            Frendz & Hugs: 9 smiles
   Funky Sample score: 9 smiles
    Light show antics:   9 smiles

Overall a resounding 9....

Seeya'll at Cosmibog or Progress (or if in any case, I can get a 411 on any
renegades)....

                         Adam =)

they whipped me around pretty good !  you had to keep keep dancing, 
cause they would trick you to thinking they were going into another
lull, but then it would kick kick back in, and if you werent still
mesmerized and moving, you would not be on it when it came down 
again :)  

what a wonderful show !  yeah, the dance floor was crampy - it's 
tough when you want to flail your arms, and cant.  those guys looked
so cool behind there boards !  is it typical for them to go from
slow to pumping to slow to pumping ?  i coulda just kept pumping,
pumping myself :)

        Hey everybody!
        I was wondering if i could ask for your help.  I'm helping out with
a party here in Montreal on July 8th and me and the others involved are
wanting to do something a bit different.  We're planning on stapling some
small info sheets to the tickets that ppl will buy in stores.  The info
sheets will be partially about the djs, their music, bios etc and a
definite emphasis on the importance of M-U-S-I-C and dancing.  We ALSO
wanted to include some short bits about PLUR, why we 'rave,' and other
ambiguous philosophical things which we feel are very important, especially
at this juncture in our scene (and, from the sounds of it, everywhere else
:( ).  So, we're going to start with a bit about 'why we're throwing this
party' which will lead to some quesitons that one would have to ask
themselves about why they are going to the party.  THis is where y'all come
in.  Because we don't want to come off as pedagogical or preachy (i
personally beleive that the best way to teach is by example but you can't
do that on paper all the time, y'know) so we're looking for input from all
of you bright, intelligent and pllurrrry people who've given ME so much
inspiration and insight in the past.
        I guess i can't specifically ask what i'm looking for: in general,
just inspirational words, ideas about why _you_ go out to parties and do
watcha do, ideas about P.L.U.R., about things that raves have to offer,
things you'd like to see more at parties, things you'd like to see less of
at parties, and so on.  The main emphasis of this will be 100% positive, as
we think that it will attract more positivity rather than DONT DO THIS or
DONT DO THAT which will usually make ppl do those things.
        Well, any help would be appreciated.  You can either reply
privately or to the list, and let me know if you'd like to be accredited by
putting your email address/name beside your thoughts or whether you'd like
to remain anonymous.  Also, if you could include your area of the west
coast (to show that there are ppl thinking the way that you do ALL OVER)
it'd be cool.
        thanks a lot for your time :)
        peace,
                brad

Freak Factor: 6

There wasn't as many really freaky people there this time. 
I remember at the '93 show the Day Glow Tribal Dancers running
through the crowd and the guy with the light suit dancing on
stage. Too bad they didn't have more DJs also. I didn't care
much for DJ Lewis, it was a bit to fast for me.  
All and all it was a pretty good show and well worth the $20.

Tristan writez:
| My real thing I have about the Orb (and I don't disslike

| write or perform all there stuff; they get in many outside writers and 
| musicans such as Steve Hillage and Jah Wobble. NOthing wrong with that 
| you might say but I am old school and music that has only been made and 
| produced the band themselves somehow has more sicerity asbout it then 
| committee music.

Uh, this is a pretty lame statement. It seems like you're actually 
dismissing a lot of great music that has come out of "committee" music,
aka sampling, remixing, dub-versions, blues, rock, or what have you. I
hate to break it to you, but this is what music is about, and has been
that way for a long time. Composers stealing and embellishing a theme
from another composer they respect/admire, Blues artists covering and
mutating "traditional" tunes of unknown origin, british rock bands
and/or the greatful dead covering these selfsame toonz, changing them
and calling them their own. And rap/hip-hoppers sampling old school
funk into boppin new songs. If it wasn't for the fact that all music is
made by a "committee" that consists of all the musics and musicians
that every musician has ever been influenced by... if it weren't for
that fact, we simply wouldn't recognize the stuff we hear as music.

With the orb, your comment is especially out of line because i see this
band as being one of the biggest promoters of the dub-influenced sound
to the techno masses. remixing and versioning was going on full well in
Jamaica in the late 60's and early 70's -- i have some of the material
and it's positively awesome, trancy, butt-moving sounds. The orb have
done a good job of transitioning the sound into the 90's, melding it
with techno sounds etc. Listen to some Lee Scratch Perry (who the Orb
sample occasionally -- a tip of the hat) and you'll hear a lot of stuff
that sounds vaguely proto-trance/techno/electro-like even though it was
all done  20 years ago in incredibly primitive studios w/ incredibly
primitive equipment (tape splicing and dubbing, live remixing and 
mastering, etc). The Orb aren't the only ones doing this and if you dig
a little deeper you can also find that dubby techno sound in Tack>>Head
and various early Adrian Sherwood On-U productsion...

Are the Orb sincere musicians? Absolutely. Was Lee Scratch Perry
sincere when he crafted (but never got recognized for) Bob Marley's
early sounds that jettisoned him to stardom and there's sincerity where
L.S.P. was creating incredibly spacy dub plates... And aren't the
Stones the Dead, and the Beatles sincere as they version classic US
blues numbers for the rock world? Yes....

(w/r/t earlier comment about the "global music committee", i do have 
problems w/ music that goes beyond musical because it stands alone and
apart from what we consider "musical"... this is essentially the
problem i had with the too-fast stuff that  DJ Lewis was playing before
the Orb show -- i get the same kinda feeling when i listen to my
computer's CPU by sticking a transistor radio up close to the box --
fast, impentetrable, and meanlingless). IMHO. ((fortunately the orb
themselves and the Dig-Truth/Dust afterparfty were *great* and even
though i tweaked long and hard last night, if feel positively bubbly
and good afterwards.)).

PS: sorry this is scattered. i'm too giddy to make this make sense.

I printed this out from a post I got from sfraves on November 2, 1994 
right after Friends and Family IV.  These inspirational words were on the 
visual screen and is a pretty good summation of why I rave:

BECAUSE WE CELEBRATE LIFE AND BATTLE
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SATISFIED
BECAUSE IT IS UP TO US
BECAUSE WE LOVE TO SING AND DANCE
BECAUSE THE PRESSURE IS UPON US
BECAUSE THERE ARE GOVERNMENTS AND BORDERS AND COPS AND COURTS
BECAUSE THE BOUNDARIES MUST BE BROKEN
BECAUSE WE ARE OUT OF CONTROL
BECAUSE THEY SAID WE COULDN'T DO IT
BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE IT

keeping it alive,
love,

[ To SFRaves mailist ]

As far as The Orb is concerned , if Tristan is the SFRaves Little Fluffy 
Cloud #1, then I guess I'm LFC #2 ...

 I actually enjoyed seeing again all the folks I know from other rave 
events more than I did listening to The Orb. Why? Well , I'll try to 
list the reasons ...

1. I had been awake since 5:30AM Friday morning , and even a nap in the
   balcony didn't get me fully rested. The late dinner at 8:30PM didn't
   help.

2. Pre-Orb/Post-Orb dj music was uninspired for the most part.

3. Too much bottom end ( Most folks are probably going HUH!??!? ). I like
   The Orb's music , but mostly for the aspects of their music apart from 
   the rythmic component. I couldn't hear what I came to hear. 

4. The $#%! strobe lights , aimed over the heads of the dancers and into
   the eyes of everyone else.

5. I didn't start dancing to The Orb until 2/3 into their set - I had 
   been listening to them upstairs. I enjoyed it more when my body was
   doing something. 

 As for pure fun, I had more of that dancing to house music at the 
1015 Folsom afterwards - that was the free admission event that Mark Ameba
was handing out flyers for. I had my choice of 70's disco or two rooms
of house music - ended up in the basement for some pure joy! (HappyHappy!).

 Congratulations to those who had a good time listening/dancing to The Orb!
See you guys at Sunset ...

 There's a Chinese restaurant in Mountain View called "RAVE NOODLE
HOUSE". I think that I am required to convene at least one South Bay
Lunch at this restaurant , for the name of it alone! 

 I've never eaten there , but I got a flyer menu today , and it looks
like a well-rounded menu , with many dishes in the $5.00 range. It's
located at 156 Castro Street , on the west side , between Villa and
Evelyn Ave/train tracks. 

 I was thinking of meeting there this Wednesday at 11:45AM - please 
reply to me if you're coming , and I'll try to reserve a table when I
have a better idea of the number of diners.

Yes it was a good light show wasn't it?  And yes they did play live.  And 
yes, I am sure that if one was on acid it would have been a very 
memorable show.  BUt music that can only be appreciated on drugs is 
exactly like people on drugs: you will only ever see superficiallity and 
stuff like covictions (remember that as a reason for getting into 
music?) go straight out of te window.  And give me the equipment and two 
fingers and I, or anybody on 
this net for that matter, can do stuff better then that.  The Orb have 
done for techno what Michael Jackson did for pop/disco: they have trivalized 
it to the point where comerciality comes way ahead of talent; but who 
gives a fuck so long as the kids by it?
In my opnion, after seeing a good live show one should feel like they know 
the mucians and composers better; that while these people are not 
personal friends at least we can relate to them as people.  I didn't 
even know which one Alex Patterson was and nothing during the show made 
me think about anything to do with him.  In short, the show had no 
concept about it bassically because the music was to week to be worthy 
of one.  When one consideres other great techno bands such as Orbital or
Caberet Voltaire or Kraftwerk one can easily answer basic thematic 
questions such as "how do you look at life?" "do you believe in love?" 
"what kind of thing's in your past made you look at life in this way?"  
"How do you look at life?"  This can be done through music, lyrics, samples, 
song titles, and live with visuals or theaterics.  After an Orbital show or 
album, for example, you can listen to a track and see the situation that it 
relates to in your minds eye ("I wish I had Duck Feet" or "Monday" for 
example).  In short, to be able to write sheer escapism music like House 
one has to be an extreamly good mucian and "The Orb" most certainly do 
not cut it in this department.
In short, the whole show represented all the worse aspects of the music 
industry.  It had loads of hype, it was extreamly short on quality and 
talent and everyone left the show thinking it was fucking amazing while 
record industry suit types were watching in the wings with $ signs in 
their eyes.  Wasn't the whole underground scene set up in the first 
place to get away from bullshit such as this?  Ah well, I guess we have 
all become victims of our own success.  And do I care?  No, I am to busy 
going out, taking drugs and having to good a time to ever think or 
care about it.
Tristan.

Here's my 2c on the Orb at the Warfield:

- The light show was good, unless you were sitting in the balcony,
  where the strobes could give you a headache quick..

- I thought the DJ was great!  It certainly wasn't SF style, but
  when I heard it, I thought, "how come nobody plays *this* shit anymore?"
  that's what i call rave music.

- Music was great, unless, again, you were sitting in the balcony.
  Up there it was mud city.

all in all, i would give it an 8.5 from the main/dance floor perspective..

        Lewis is one of my favorites, he always goes on about 'proper
techno' and how it's only made in north america, not that 'euro cheese.'
british by upbringing but north american by heart :)

Well I left LA early this morning feeling good about my visit.  It was 
nice to leave with no traffic and plenty of sunshine which was just the 
opposite coming in.  Sorry I didn't get to meet anybody from the 
socal-raves list, but I do feel closer to you all after being able to go 
to a good rave there and share the energy.
Driving back I had plenty of time to enjoy some tunes and philosiphy a 
bit as I enjoyed the nice scenery.  I thought a bit about how much I been 
gaining  by learning more about how to recognize the beingness in 
everything thus adding to my own state of beingness.  I feel I got to 
thank raving for helping me alot with this.  To me dancing is such a 
great way to show recognition in the beingness of the music the people 
and the whole enviroment.  As we all recogize the music together, there 
is then a recognition in the beauty of our togetherness which we all can 
get high  from.
This sure happened in abundance at the sunset party which i am so HAPPY i 
made it back in time for.  As usual this sunset party was GREAT!  The 
vibe was so thick you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.  A beautiful sunny 
clear day, great music and so many friendly people.  I really enjoyed the 
socializing when I did, which wasn't much away from the dance floor.  I 
felt I couldn't leave the dance area much as it was so filled with 
BEAUTIFUL energy and it felt so good to be able to share it.
So here I am still basking in the afterglow.  Feeling so good, thought I 
share some of it with all you beautiful people through in cyberspace.

Never been.

Always too groggy to go.

Today was the day.

People everywhere.

Thanks for the popsicles.

Dancing babies and inquisitive doggies.

Diet dessert spray tastes like chocolate.

C'mon.  Don't deny it! It was the  a b s o l u t e  SHIT!!

I spoke at sunset with one of the people involved with putting on the 
progress party, and I think she said that the sound guy or the the guy 
who owns the equiptment (not good on details while I'm raving) thought 
the fog was too much for the equiptment so it didn't happen.  But she did 
say they are going to put on another to make up for that one.  If your 
wondering when, uh, ( those details again), I don't know but I remember 
that its soon.  Sorry about those details, I'm sure somebody out there 
may get them details if your interested.  One detail I do remember is 
that there next scheduled progress party is at big heart city.  Its been 
awhile since i been there.  I've had some great times in that space.  
OOhh those tuesday together partys in the basement.  Anybody remember  
those.  I used to have  weds off and used to have a great time tues night in 
that sweaty basement when I went.

You know Tristan. I wasn't going to reply to any of your post about the
orb because I knew every would just delete your post anyways, after
reading them and forget what they said. But read on:

I work with musicians on a daily basis. Both with my day job and with
the business I own on the side. I would like to see you get in front of
all that equipment and churn out stuff one tenth as good. If you can
then mail it to me at:
K&D enterprises
1901 P street
Sacramento , ca 95814

I will send those songs to a couple of record companies. If one of those
songs become popular I am going to take a picture of the $$$$$$ in your
eyes and then show you a print out of this post.

I take your last post as a complete insult to the music industry. There
is no underground in music once it becomes released to the public. Even
house underground is public and popular and about money. That's why the
musicians work hard. To pay the bills. I'm sure when you go to work you
think about money! If you don't then your a gimp.

  Read your post about not liking the orb then read this next statement:

WHY THE PHUCK DID YOU GO TO THE CONCERT?

I don't mind people voiceing their opinion over sfraves but, Tristan,
you are way too predictable! Your post don't excite the senses!


Make every day a better day,
Don't make it the best,
Because you would have
nothing to look foward to
the next day!

I'm sure that the rest of Tristan's comments on the Orb show will be 
flamed and discussed at length [:)], so I feel no need to add my voice to 
the din, being less knowledgeable about the music than many here and not 
actually having experienced the show anyway.

However her closing words, sarcastic though they may have been, should 
give us all pause for thought.  After the after-party at 150 Folsom I was 
given a ride home by some kind Monterey ravers (thanx guys!) and one of 
them let me photocopy an article she had on the rave scene in England.  I 
think it illustrates quite well how much more aware, committed and 
involved our counterparts across the Atlantic are when it comes to larger 
social issues beyond simply throwing and attending parties.  The article 
is fairly long and I am too tired to type it in now, but I promise to 
post it soon.

Personally I went to this show to enjoy the music, which I did very much. 
I did not go to "see" Alex Patterson, I went to escape into the music and to
be carried to other wonderful places. I think Alex Patterson/Orb was
successful
in NOT bringing the focus to himself. This show was not about an audience all

focused on a performer (at least not for me). I was not at all interested in
someone
elses *concept* or a show *theme*.  I let this music move me at a very basic
simple 
level. 

It may be interesting to compare Orbital, the Orb, etc based on *themes*, or
*concepts*, 
or other thought based layers above the raw basic music. But when you throw
out all that
over-analysis and get down to the underlying music.. The Orb music draws me
in and
moves me at the most basic level. It takes me to some amazing places that
other, more refined, 
developed, contrived music simply can't.  I very much enjoy Orbital, but it's
more *head* music 
for me. The Orb very much is head and *body* and the show definetly moved
*both* for me. 

Just my opinion,
martin

PS. I can see how someone who was just maybe sitting in the balcony the whole
time and was not 
really  "in" the mood (and i'm not talking just drugs) to be moved could have
been dissapointed. It's funny how music is so many different things to
different people.

Anyone confirm/deny?  It was pretty unexpected.

I can't understand why anyone would go to a show like this unenhanced.
Janie and I went expecting complete sensory overstimulation and the
Orb totally delivered.  We found a great spot downstairs; the sound
swirled around us, the visuals engulfed us, we were blown away, and it 
was fabulous!
 
> BUt music that can only be appreciated on drugs is

Perhaps you speak of your own experiences in which case I can only
feel sorry for you.  But with the Orb show, I'm not sure we were supposed 
to be looking for anything deep and meaningful anyway.  It was a crazy
journey to the beyond in which sensory overload became a vehicle for a 
transcendental experience.  Now that I think of it, this kind of communal 
letting go *is* meangingful, and has always been a big part of what raving 
is all about - our ability to go beyond our limits.   As the show 
progressed, everyone around us on the main floor was going nuts in a manic
tribal celebration of perceptual insanity.  But it was also apparent that 
we were not supposed to take things too seriously as the Orb would 
periodically inject silliness into the stew to reground us.

Y'know, I couldn't disagree more with this.  I couldn't care less about 
who Patterson is as a person.  The whole point of techno is that the
creation transcends the creator; the DJ or musician becomes a shaman, a 
guide to another world.  I left the whole personal-statement-from-the-artist
trip behind a long time ago.  It even seemed silly to us that a "band" was
present at all.  Luckily we couldn't really see the live musicians in
front of the stage stupidly playing their instruments.  At one point during 
the frenzy, I wondered how many ravers thought they were at a rock show, 
and how many rock show poeple thought they were at a rave.  All I knew was 
that whatever it was, it was fantastic!

Actually, I'd say it represented the *best* aspect of the industry:
the ability to deliver PIZAZZ.  The one thing of value that the entertainment 
industies  have to offer is big production, simply because they have the 
technology and money.  Unfortunately, corporate-inspired entertainment 
rarely caters to psychedelic sensibilities like the Orb did.  In that 
regard the Orb was much better than any show I've seen, easily surpassing
the last time I saw Pink Floyd a trillion years ago.

After the Orb ended, many of the supercharged remained to be treated to
a great set by DJ Lewis who spun some tasty electrotrance on the 
Warfield's big system.   People raved pretty hard until we were thrown
out at around 3:30.  We hopped over to 1015 Folsom with free passes, but
the scene there was too much of a comedown so we decided to chill out in
anticipation of Sunday's Sunset.

Sunset, back at the Berkely Marina with the Karma Kids was, as usual, 
utterly great.  Nick Philips started out which one of the best ambient 
sets I've heard in a while.  Galen followed, picking things up a bit, then 
Loren gave us some juicy house to sink our teeth into.  Solar followed with 
one of his harder  sets and really got the crowd going.  John Howard kept 
the energy level high... Wow, we must have danced for 6 hours on Sunday 
along  with the shitload of SFRavers, old timers and new timers in 
attendance.  We didn't stay for the end, so I'm assuming everyone sang 
Happy Birthday to Galen when it was over.

We'll probably take next week off but are already looking forward to
Freedom on July 1st, which like last year will be at the Livermore
racetrack.  Nothing like a good outdoor massive.  Ahh.

Lee

I wasn't on any drugs for this show, and I had a great time.  One of the
best times I've had at a concert yet.  All I can remember from the last Orb
show, and the last Orbital show in SF, was that I had fun...but I was so
high at them that I can't remember what happened.  I'll always be able to
remember this show as one of the best.  

I liked how most of the tracks seemed to have more hard bass in them which
made them more dancy.  I was able to go places in my mind that in the past
only drugs would induce.  IN MY OPINION, the Orb is still genius.  They have
taken me on trips in my mind that no other band has.  When listing as
background music, the samples always come in at just the right time in
conversation.  IMO it is state of consciousness that determines what music
sounds like and the way it affects you.  IMO we create our own reality.  If
my opinion is correct, then my positive attitude before seeing the show had
a great affect on it.  It was a great show for me, I was totally amazed.
Regardless if everyone in the world thinked they sucked, my experience was
splended...

This is not a flame on Tristan, but he didn't seem to have a very good
attitude going into the show and just maybe, just maybe that's why he had
difficulty with it.

I was so elated to find out that Sunset would be at Berkeley Marina! :)  
That is such an ideal spot with a beautiful view of San Francisco.

I had *such* a good time and danced hard - hell, who didn't? Saw many 
familiar faces, and met about 20 new people.  I feel so happy to be a 
part of sfraves.  All of the sfravers I have met so far - and that is 
*alot* - have been absolutely WONDERFUL!! Being on sfraves has given me 
the opportunity to know so many of you - and each of you is so unique 
and special.  Everywhere I turned at the Sunset party I saw someone I 
recognized or knew, and it made me feel, even more, that I was 
surrounded by *family*.  And that is the kind of closeness and community 
that I find is so unique to raving.  I felt the warmness from EVERYONE 
and the energy was addicting. I had brought an old friend of mine who 
has never been to a "rave-type" event before and he ended up doing alot 
of dancing and feeling the energy. I love bringing "newbies" because I 
feel so proud to be a part of all this, and when I bring them to 
somethig like sunset, I can say "This is ME!!" :):):)
I'm *so* happy that Sunset will now be a weekly thing.  I took up a roll 
of film with some great shots of many sfravers I met.  I'll bring them 
on July 2nd to show 'em to ya.  

Have a great week!
love,
Amy

it's a shame you didn't share in the amazing experience that was this show.
i know it's complete flamebait, and i'm falling for it hook, line, and

Maybe you need to go attend a real rock concert, with a real star on
stage spreading his/her legs wide and trying to look cool (look at me
I'm a rock god!) while noodling up and down the guitar neck in full
masturbatory regalia. I've seen plenty of that, and it gets *old* after
a while, (but at least you'll know the names of the lead guitarist and
lead singer.)

If I wanted more cult-of-personality signer/songwriter schtick, there's
plenty out there to choose from. I don't think that's the "techno"
style, except for maybe Moby... 

And, IMHO, the Orb was much a much more interesting live performance
than Cabaret Voltaire.

I think you're being ridiculous to think that Kraftwerk or Cab Voltaire
are going to give you the answers or a theme behind life or love. If I
want life/love-themes, I'll listen to Bob Dylan lyrics -- for example
the lyrics to his "Blood on the Tracks" LP, ancient though it may be,
speaks more to love/live than any Orb or Orbital tracks. Part of that
is because Dylan's poetry is evocative, it literally speaks to you and
reminds you of lost loves, lost lives, love, anger, emotion, and
sentiment. The "evocativeness" is in the poetry and lyrics -- complete
sentences or stanzas are a lost art in the era of the sample and the
sound byte and the 10 second attention span.

There's nothing comparitively lyrical and evocative in techno, which is
fine, because it "speaks" to a more basic, less structured, and perhaps
more primitive part of the psyche. In some sense "techno" is all sound
and fury signifying nothing. And that's good and fine too.

I'd say you (Tristan) are looking for love/life in all the wrong
places. I listen to the Orb and other "techno" "dub" etc to shake my
booty and forget/escape/surpass/overview the quagmires of love and
life. Words are more often than not tinged with lies, deceit and
pretense. Techno speaks straight to the boppin' of de booty and the
mind temporarily freed from the chains of rationality and language.

Alex was the guy on the left in the black and white shirt, not the guy by
the mixing board on the right.

I thought the show was pretty good, with some nice versions of some of
their tracks, especially "Towers of Dub." The sound really disappointed me,
however. During the DJ's set it was sorely overdriven and while it was a
bit better during the live show it was still brittle and harsh.

The afterparty was amazingly good. Lee played a stellar set, the visuals
were cool, and the vibe was excellent.

Anybody that says The Orb are better the Caberet Voltaire clearly knows 
so little about (techno) music that anything they have ever to say on 
the subject in the future should be trated as if it came from the voice of 
a three year old.  No offence Neil, but you really do not have clue.

Wow!  This sure was a pretty thick weekend for me; thought I'd say hi to all
of you and let you know what transpired...
I went to the Orb show with SFRaver Reza and had a fantastic Friday night. I
think I was equally impressed by both the Orb *and* DJ Lewis, who blew me away
at the Warfield... it was so nice to hear FAST FAST music!  
We headed over to the afterparty being put on by the Dust crew around 2:30,
met up with more friends and caught the vibE and danced to more excellent spin-
ning, especially from Jon Carel, who closed the party with some of the best st            
stuff I've ever heard. 
After quite a bit of dancing and splashing about (we noticed that water can be
a lot of fun when tossed in the air), we headed back to Berkeley for some sleep,.
My roommate and I woke up around noon, had lunch with a friend, and then stopped
by some friends' house, where I listened to my friend spin some brilliantly
FAST stuff, which was so much more fun to dance to for me than the music I'm 

used to hearing. Hey all you DJ's out there!  How 'bout some slices of 180 bpm?
It tastes reeeeeallly good. Anyway, Progress was next on the agenda, but we 
bought tix for 5 dollars and then the thing was rained out. Do any Progress
people plan on giving refunds soon?  We have 9 tickets here! 
So Saturday night we crashed in the aforementioned friends' attic back in B,
and Sunday was nice and peaceful.  Sunset was the weekend's cherry-on-top, and
it was as great as it always is to bump into so many of you there.

(blissful sigh) Whew... Mondays are so hard.
See you all out there
Timothy

John Howard 
absolutely ruled my world at Sunset
to borrow a friend's phrase, it was my cup of tea

I finally, briefly, met Amy S - which was a pleasure.
Mike, the san mateo sfraver, had a nice hometown revelation. 
I felt the same way meeting another astronomer/raver the other weekend 
... we seem to share an affinity for photons *and* feather boas. 

The central dance area was in the funkiest little bowl.  It was cozy to
perfection.  From every spot you could see just about everybody else.  I like
it when you are dancing and looking around and then you momentarily lock with someone
across the crowd.  Besides the thirty yards and 200 people in between that sorta
thing tends to leave me speechless no matter what.  Note also, how much I 
adored the tragic weeping on the grass.  It was very greek amphitheatre.

After dark, there was an intense torchlit communal groove.  What seemed
to be simmering in the afternoon turned into overflow writhing.

so much fun,
Dave

	Tristan, it is an oft-repeated bit of wisdom in the country of
my people that he or she who accuses one of having no clue is quite
often the clueless one. Maybe it would behoove you to more closely
read the posts you so cleverly rip to shreds before priming the
flamethrower. Two small points:

	a) It is rather pointless to say that someone is less clueful
than one when one is discussing opinions, and in fact tends to make
one look like a bit of an ass.

	b) Niels was specifically discussing the merits of seeing the
Orb vs seeing CV _live_. Although it's not particularly germane
because it is, again, an opinion, I thought I'd point out that I've
heard plenty of live recordings of both, and I strongly prefer live
Orb stuff to live CV stuff.

yrz,

I thought the Orb were quite good. I didn't like the Warfield that much 
but the music was extremely tripped(and I wasn't on drugs). Whoever says the 
Orb does not have talent can't really know that much about music.

Alex Patterson played a great set at the Dust afterparty. I spoke to one 
of the guys from the Orb and he was totally cool, very mellow  and not 
pretentious.

All in all a good show but there is always room for improvement.

     Amy Starkey sez:
     
     "And that is the kind of closeness and community that I find is so 
     unique to raving.  I felt the warmness from EVERYONE and the energy 
     was addicting." 
     
     ------
     Not to belabor a point, but after being out of the scene for a couple 
     of weeks and going through alot of personal stuff, I have to agree 
     with Amy.  At first I thought I was going through music & dancing 
     withdrawals, and then I thought it was some other type of withdrawal 
     ;) but the reality of what I was missing in the past two weeks was the 
     connectivity and joy that I felt at Sunset.  Thanks Pacific crew for 
     bringing us together!
     
     It was truly a good time for me as I needed a release or escape from 
     day-to-day pressures and was able to let go of the negative energy 
     that's been bapping me over the head.
     
     I finally met some more sfravers, too.  I felt very much like a newbie 
     gaggling over the fact that I met so many of the people I've 
     identified with and/or appreciated for their contributions to the list 
     (or even for making it happen!).  Thanks Peter for grabbing me to the 
     "sfraves circle" and introducing me to the group.  As I started 
     conversing w/y'all, I felt a surge of energy rise in the air--a 
     definite sign for me that things were going to take off.  It was great 
     to see Lee and Jaimie again.  And to finally meet Amy, Laura, Brian, 
     Neils, Seth (Welcome!), Mike and a few others who's names I can't 
     remember right now.  
     
     Looking forward to meeting more of you as time goes on. 
     
     Warm embraces,
     Diane

     rented van to haul my water and art supplies.  If anyone's interested

     at Sunset or something less formal.  In any case, let me know.

I agree with Niels' message for the most part,

This is so different from my own feelings about techno music  -
for me, techno is the most lyrical, most evocative music I have yet found.

It has inspired my passions and thoughts, and connected me
with my emotions like no other music.  In its beat, I feel rhythm,
patterns, a cycle like life or the beat of our hearts.
The "trancey," "acidy" sounds worm through my mind with the same
intensity as my own obsessions - put to music, though, I can watch
them squirm through my mind - thoughts turned to sounds, which I can
dance with, instead of blindly follow.

The vocal samples, in their endless loops, hold for me such poignancy
and longing - they are impossible, infinite, inhuman.  Voices removed from
meaning, or any hope of meaning save than which we, the listeners,
bring to them - their digitized humanity is so plaintive,
electronicly cut-off from context, made "mute" in the face of technology,
that they become paradoxically human and inhuman at the same time.

I do not listen to music for, as Tristan stated earlier:
an "answer" to "basic thematic questions such as 'how do you look
at life?' 'do you believe in love?'"

I do not want to be fed these "answers," through the interpretations
of someone else - we get these standardized formulaic answers so often,
from everywhere, every day.  Techno/trance/ambient music
provides the soundtrack for my own internal "movie" -
my own themes, refrains, cast of characters.  The sound moves me
through my own imaginings, and doesn't limit me
to specific themes or moods like conventional songs/musical genres/
lyrics do.

Instead, techno music lets me create my own questions, and,
my own *answers* - my mind is free to move, imagine, dream with
the music to a place where my thoughts take me.  When I feel FREE,
_then_ I dance - I am SELF conscious, not self-conscious, and I can
move with joy and understanding inside my mind & body.

This process of listening, responding, interpreting, relating,
moving, dancing, *being* - is not just a way to feel about techno music,
but the best way, so far, for me to try to _live_ that I have
found...

Sorry this is so long.
Rhea

Alex was the guy on the left in the black and white shirt, not the guy by
the mixing board on the right.

I thought the show was pretty good, with some nice versions of some of
their tracks, especially "Towers of Dub." The sound really disappointed me,
however. During the DJ's set it was sorely overdriven and while it was a
bit better during the live show it was still brittle and harsh.

The afterparty was amazingly good. Lee played a stellar set, the visuals
were cool, and the vibe was excellent.

Maybe you need to go attend a real rock concert, with a real star on
stage spreading his/her legs wide and trying to look cool (look at me
I'm a rock god!) while noodling up and down the guitar neck in full
masturbatory regalia. I've seen plenty of that, and it gets *old* after
a while, (but at least you'll know the names of the lead guitarist and
lead singer.)

If I wanted more cult-of-personality signer/songwriter schtick, there's
plenty out there to choose from. I don't think that's the "techno"
style, except for maybe Moby... 

And, IMHO, the Orb was much a much more interesting live performance
than Cabaret Voltaire.

I think you're being ridiculous to think that Kraftwerk or Cab Voltaire
are going to give you the answers or a theme behind life or love. If I
want life/love-themes, I'll listen to Bob Dylan lyrics -- for example
the lyrics to his "Blood on the Tracks" LP, ancient though it may be,
speaks more to love/live than any Orb or Orbital tracks. Part of that
is because Dylan's poetry is evocative, it literally speaks to you and
reminds you of lost loves, lost lives, love, anger, emotion, and
sentiment. The "evocativeness" is in the poetry and lyrics -- complete
sentences or stanzas are a lost art in the era of the sample and the
sound byte and the 10 second attention span.

There's nothing comparitively lyrical and evocative in techno, which is
fine, because it "speaks" to a more basic, less structured, and perhaps
more primitive part of the psyche. In some sense "techno" is all sound
and fury signifying nothing. And that's good and fine too.

I'd say you (Tristan) are looking for love/life in all the wrong
places. I listen to the Orb and other "techno" "dub" etc to shake my
booty and forget/escape/surpass/overview the quagmires of love and
life. Words are more often than not tinged with lies, deceit and
pretense. Techno speaks straight to the boppin' of de booty and the
mind temporarily freed from the chains of rationality and language.

Lissen here butt-head... you're entitled to your opinion, and I'm
entitled to mine. I've seen Cabaret Voltaire live once, and I've seen
the Orb live twice. They were totally different shows, and I liked the
Orb more both times. So there.

Can you deal with that, or are you the only one entitled to opinions
(no matter how stupid or attitude laden they may be) around here? I
want to have my own stupid attitude-laden opinions too! For one if you
had a clue yourself you'd note that CV and the Orb are completely
different genres. But I'm sure it's all just one big muddle in that
confused head of yours.

Oh, and just which cabaret voltaire are you talking about, CV during
the early 80's, or CV during the late 80's or what. Nice attempt at
name dropping in either case, but i'm not impressed. Hey, I've seen
Throbbing Gristle before you were a cum stain in a peep-show
wank-booth, and spoke the hallowed name of GPO before yo momma learned
how to use a turkey baster, so would you please kiss my fetid pink
bunghole for that too?

Now go back and start diddling on yer guitar/keyboards, then when
you've paid your dues, we'll all know your name so that we can give
proper rock and roll obeisance (yessss yessssss! that's coool!) to your
purported sense of genius. Just watch out for the beer bottles
splintering into jagged shards on the chicken wire while people are
noticing how "special" you are.

I understand this, but i don't get it. you're talking in circles, none

it's a shame you didn't share in the amazing experience that was this show.
i know it's complete flamebait, and i'm falling for it hook, line, and 
sinker with this, but please, take your negative, forever cynical ass 
and jump off the bridge, because nothing is going to please or satisfy you 
and it seems that there will be no more happiness in your life. i think 
i've seen you post something positive like *once*. get over it.

I think Tristan needs a full-on dose of the famed net.raver LUV PHASER.

Tristan, you may think it's sooo coool being lame on line, but let me
assure you it's not.  Why don't you get off your high horse and just be
the real you for a change?

i hardly ever read posts about sunset's now...
but for different reasons than the normal ones (like uninteresting 
topics...flame wars...or just never reading posts some people write)

but the reason i don't read sunset posts is cause they're usually the same.
if it's not a request for the info #...it's a post saying how awesome 
sunset was and how it went off. i think that's kinda funny :)

anyways
go if you haven't.
it's easily my favorite party/event/rave/whateveryoulikecallingthem

A special thanks to everyone who respond to my post regarding Sankofa.  I 
didn't meet any SFravers, next time i'll try to be more distinctive =)
Sankofa started pretty good, but then a couple of friends and I tried to 
get some E and ended up wasting $100 on fake stuff.  Pretty bad vibes.  

We tried to get some real stuff and thanks to a couple of guys the night 
wasn't a total waste.  So thanks to Kip, Sam and Rich.  Thanks for taking 
care of us, and giving us such good vibes.  Hope to see you guys at the 
next event. =)

Peace and Love

        Thank you to all who sent me ideas to put on the little info sheets
that we're going to attatch to the tickets for this party, it's really
appreciated and i hope it goes over well :)
        Also, i'd just like to *briefly* say that i'm really amazed by the
lot of you sometimes.  When confronted with a lot of negativity (no names
mentioned) i see a lot of work at empathizing and discussing and
acceptance, with a few flames but it's only normal.  I guess i just think
that, with me at least, i confront negativity with positivity rather than
feeding the flames (no pun int.) Understanding is the only way we can all
get this culture and, i guess, this planet going along in a good direction.
y'all should be proud of yourselves.  I also wanted to say that i too used
to be kind of a bummer type of guy but, though i hate to pinpoint it so
specifically, when i got a little hElp i really REALLY began to see things
in a different way.  I used to think i was 'realistic' in being cynical and
depressive.  I realized that i was just being cynical and depressive.  So
i've been there and i know that it's not a permanent thing, you just need a
little help and support from others, be they chemical entities or not =)
        sorry, that wasn't as brief as i'd wanted to, oh well.
        peace n hugs n positivity n sunshine

I have to say yesterday was an AMAZING day.  Jake (my rottie) and I had 
 such a great day.  Being a newbie, I want to thank all the friendly 
ravers that made me feel like I belonged....especially Amy and Peter who 
came and talked to me when I was feeling like the new kid in school.  
Well I hope to see you all at many more parties and I apologize if Jake 
ran across your blanket, knocked over your drink or got in your face.  He 
was just exited at so many friendly people.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hi,

This is my first post containing real content to this list. It's kind of a
mish mash of things, but if you have the time, I would appreciate it if you
could read it.

I have been on this list since June 12th. I have only been to a few raves,
but that's changing quickly. :)

I am actually writing to the list and saying these words because I too
(like tristan?), and not that long ago, was a very cynical person. Dark
humor and cutting words ruled my world. I probably did it as some kind of
release. I don't know for sure. What I do know was that it really wore on
me, and it overshadowed my spirit, and over the years, dulled my aura, so
to speak. Upon further, honest introspection, I knew that it was not a good
thing. These deep, dark feelings reared their ugly head in conversations,
in relationships, in friendships. Deep down, I wasn't that happy with the
person I was, and people around me probably weren't that happy with me
either.

Coincidentally, about two months ago, I crashed a party down the hall from
my place that happened to be a small rave. To my benefit, a few special
friends introduced me to their rave scene (SYNTONIC!) and I feel that I
have been changed forever. After my enlightenment, I can now easily explain
to someone that you that you can tell someone to be happy, but until you
show them what it is to be happy, they will not understand. You might as
well be speaking to them in a foreign tongue, because they probably won't
get it. It's really sad, because they may even have some fleeting thoughts
about being happy, but until they have been led to it, they may never find
it on their own.

The most powerful and surprising thing I have received from this (scene and
list) is the support and major _positive vibe_ from each and every person I
have met in this scene. They (you!) have been my inspiration and my
unknowing (but willing!) 'support group' that's helped me find and keep and
remember that positive energy that I get from our experiences together. The
benefit is that I feel so spiritually cleansed, and I feel like so much of
that dark baggage of the past is gone. Often, I think back to the person I
was just a couple months ago and look at the person I am today, and also
think of the person I will become tomorrow (hopefully!) and just can't
believe what an awesome, magical force that exists in your (now our)
incredibly enlightened culture.

Anyway, I read this list not just to find out the happenings (although to
tell you the truth that's why I originally subscribed), but to also read
the words that people are writing that's coming from their hearts and their
soul, which was an unknown-to-me added bonus of the sfraves-list scene. The
poems and post-happening experiences messages are really cool. I often feel
the same way as these people do about the events we've gone to (sol y luna,
orb, dust/truth, sunset!!) and the parallels of our experiences. The
positive energy of both the events and the list are great.

Now the place where this is all breaking down for me, I have to mention
something about. Every once in a while, one of our fellow list-members pops
up his head, takes a cynical pot-shot at something and then goes away. It
brings me down. I don't want to auto-filter his messages, because in an
idealistic way, I really want to hear what _everybody_ has to say. I
actually take the time to read and ingest read each and every message, and
I feel like I learn something interesting or valuable from most all of
them. I just get the impression that our friend's 180 degrees out of sync
with the open and feeling vibe that this list and culture seems to be all
about. I don't want to preach to him, but I wish that he could be as lucky
as I have been in making a transformation to a more positive contributor
(spiritually, if nothing else!) to the scene. I think he really needs his
friends (that's you?!) to help him through this difficult time so that he
can really 'find the other side'. It's really much more fun over here where
all his friends are. That's the side I am now on, and I would not trade it
for anything.

I don't want to ramble on much longer, but those of you who have known me
for a while (some of you have known me for years, some only for hours) know
that I don't write and emote this way often, if ever. I just had to get all
of these feelings off my chest and into your brains so you may hopefully
understand me and my new perspective a little better next time we meet.

And now, as they say, 'to sum it all up:'

-I used to have a bad attitude, and it was a dark cloud that affected all
   aspects of my life.
-I got a clue to the coolness* of this scene. (*the word 'coolness' does not do
   begin to do justice but I was feeling a bit short of words. sorry.)
-I opened my mind and my heart to new friends, and learned from them.
-I cleansed my spirit through sharing, caring, and regular check-ups (sunset!)
-I feel like I have now mostly left my old self behind.
-I want to thank my old friends that made this trip before me and that acted
   as my guide for helping me get to the other side.
-I wanted to share this with all my new friends that I truly care about SO MUCH
   that have helped me change my world in all their special ways.
-I want the same magic to happen for anybody that's having a hard time shedding
   their negative energy and old ways, that really wants to grow spiritually,
   and become a better human.

Remember, each of us has our own special interests, skills, and knowledge,
and none of us knows it all. When we get together to share ourselves with
each other, collectively, we can know a lot, and that's exciting. Everybody
I have met has something special they've shared with me that has added to
my collective knowledge, and it's been exciting. It just takes a good
attitude, a lot of caring, and leaving your ego at the door. The rest seems
to all just follow.

Thanks to everybody that's been there for me, and thanks in advance to
those of you I haven't met yet.

a big hug for all of you,
Wayne

Hey Brad!
When you decide what to use on your info sheets, will you post out a copy 
to sfraves?  I'd really be interested in what you decided to print.

love,
Amy

p.s.  For those @ Sunset - did any of you get that poem about Freedom 
that was handed out?  It was really great and said alot of meaningful 
things. I love getting stuff like that and what Brad is going to do. 
Kudalini did something like that too for their party on the 24th. It 
makes me stop and ponder again what it means to rave and makes it all the 
more meaningful for me when I do.  Just my thoughts.......

Hmmmm.....I never tire of reading positive reviews - especially if I was 
at the event.  It's always interesting to see how others experienced the 
same party.  The posts may always be positive, but I equate it to a 
really good song that is in several different mix tapes:  the song may be 
the same, but each time I hear it I get chills and could never tire of 
hearing it because of the different contexts surrounding the song in each 
mix tape.  That's the way I look at it anyway....

love,
Amy

	Possibly something is being overlooked here. Tristan didn't say he
was taking their answers (or questions derived from the stated questions)
as his own. He said that was how he got to know someone and indeed to
really know someone, one knows something about how another thinks on these
topics, don't they? I came at this from one perspective because I didn't
think one could really understand what an artist put into her or his work
without sittting down with the author, but there is a lot one can learn
about someone from the music they play - the various style spawns some
emotions and feelings and the such in the listener, and thus one does get
some sense of who the artist is (Granted it is not going to be a deep
understanding and I still have doubts about whether one can decipher the
thoughts on love and death from the emotions produced by the music). I 
may be m,issing the mark totally, in which case, I assume at least one 
message will find its way to me describing just how wrong I am so that I 
will not make such a mistake again....

	Following what john had said, each post seems to include the same 
bit:
	Sunset was a great party ...... lots of smiling, friendly people,
DJ so-and-so spun the best set ever...... DJ After-so-and-so whipped the
crowd even higher!!!

	The things I see changing tend to be comments about how nice the
site was. It is a fun party, and the crowd feels quite nice, but I have 
do the same thing as john...

Wayne,
thanks for sharing about how the scene has been able to be such a 
positive influence.  I agree with you about the flaming.  I think it is 
natural for many of us to feel like flaming.  I think these are the 
times, when we really get to test our ability to use plur.  
spreading plur has allowed people like yourself to be able to spread 
plur.  What a nice thing to share. 
Thanks for that, your positive loving energy has been felt.

:)

yes folks, the day is drawing nearer and NEARER when I shall descend upon
your puny little town.  Muhahahah.  :)  What I want to know is ... is
Sunset a weekly thing?  It seems to be.  ANd how much should I budget for
the average party and er um accessories, shall we say?  Here my evenings
totals usually come to about $50 canadian .... if it's a GOOD evening.  If
it's only an okay one, they'll be from free to $10. :)

Someone promise to show me Positively Haight, please?  My best buddy needs
a toe ring from there.

I look forward MOST EAGERLY to meeting you all!

Although actually a bit dated, here are a few thoughts from that night :

My first impression was dissapointment at being ambushed with a $20 
cover charge at the door. For a show that had no price on either the 
flyer *or* the phone line, and was assumed to be somewhere around the $10 
listed price range of the failed May 12 show, I thought it to be a pretty 
bunk tactic. If you think your party's good enough to warrant such a 
steep price don't be afraid to admit it beforehand. Pull something like 
that again and I'll be forced to brand you a coward.

Once inside it seemed that there was a lack or personalities, or I guess 
you could say there was an abundance of personalities yet to be developed, 
although with time and effort and it didn't prove all that difficult to 
find neat people to bug out with. Life tends to be like that.

My biggest problem with the set up was that someone accidentally left the 
ambient room in the downstairs main floor and crammed the danceable 
material in an upstairs closet. The music that the masses were 
listening to was scictozphrenic, absent-minded, and timid...Like having 
virgin sex with your senile grandmother. Kinda fun at times but not the 
real orgasm.

I was all set to give bonus art-core points for the Naked Pagan Girls, but 
the 5th encore kind of overkilled that sentiment. Although I thought it 
was really interesting to see ((from what I saw)) that a mixed all-ages 
crowd treated the sometimes defenseless pair with quite a bit of 
respect. Call it San Francisco, call it House Music... I don't know, I 
was pretty impressed. Next time don't be afraid to parade some dick 
around as well.     

The visuals definatelly fell into the way-cool category. Finally someone 
who put a bit more effort into their trade than just running some nature 
slides or renting the mind's eye from Tower for the night. 

I still have mixed emotions about the eveaning. I think it could have been 
a far greater party than it was if the music being played was more 
appropriate for the space it was being played in. I haven't decided 
whether I'm willing to shell out $20 for a another CosmicBog party, but I 
appreciate the effort that went into their production and hope to see 
something equally creative, if not a bit more focused, from them in the 
future.

No fuckin shit...  Lets get "Hard and dirty" ..  Wait till you hear some of
the tapes I brought back with me from Australia.   I still haven't scheduled
a "tape listening party".   Do we have any volunteers for a space with a
good tape sound system?   If you like fast music,  you'll like some of the
stuff I brought back with me.

I really would like to start a scene with harder faster beats,   and I have
a good lead on this kind of music.

Sunset
======

I had planned to go to the Progress outdoor party,   but as usual,  it
was rained out.   I didn't want to pay $20 to go to "All together now",
although I hear it did go off.    I was still nauseated from the over
exposure to tobacco smoke from the Orb show,  and it's afterparty,  so
after going as far as Tam Junction,  I wisely turned around and went
home.

On Sunday afternoon,  waited for the info to be updated that was to give
out the location to Sunset.

We eventually left around 3 PM,  and discovered it had moved from where
it was last year.   After walking around for a while,   I discovered it
was closer to the water in a perfectly shaped grass bowl that was made
for this very purpose.   After scouting around for a wind sheltered
place,  I set up my blanket in time to hear some really spacy ambient
music that fit perfectly for just lying in the sun.   The day was
perfect,  although cool and windy.   There was this dude in a cart,
getting pulled around by his kite.   Lots of kite flying,  and people
just hanging out.

Later on,  Galen went on and gradually shifted the music towards the
beats and eventually people started dancing.   I had just returned from
walking around and discovered 20 people dancing already.

Galen started picking up the energy,  and it didn't take me long to
totally trance out to the music.   All through the afternoon,  the
outing was perfect in every detail.   There was a very high SFRave
quotient,  which is always a good indication of the quality of the vibe.

I don't know how many people showed up,   but it seemed to be over 200
to me,   but I wasn't really paying attention.    After Galen went on,
DJ Loren (Who I have seen around the scene,   but don't recall hearing
him spin),   spun some really good trancy house that really went off.

Then,   John Howard went on,  and really got the place hoppin.   People
cheering and really getting it on..  Then,  at the end,  we all sung
Happy Birthday to Galen,  and John spun a slower final song to end one
of the best Sunsets I've been at,  and my First since my return from Oz.

Ahhh!!  Looks like this is going to be one really killer summer.   WOW!
Solstice on Wednesday afternoon,  German trance that evening,   and who
knows what comes later...   Yowsa!!  I'm ready to rave...  and I might
just stay out of the clubs and give my lungs a break.   Lets keep these
outdoor parties churnin...

Hey look;  racism is an opinion too but as any sound person knows it a). 
a wrong and bad opnion and b). it is an opnion made by an ignorant 
person.  If someone was being racist should I just say, "that's okay he's 
just voicing an opinion?  Stupid and ignorant opinions,  or opnions that 
can not stand up to healthly argument, are obviouslly not based on deep 
held convictions by the person holding the opnion so the only person you 
are really dissing is yourself.
You say that the Orb are better then Caberet Voltaire live.  I saw a Cab 
show the other day from 1983 and the light show was very similer to the 
Orb.  In short, you can not say the Orb were better live because they 
stole all their ideas from the Cab Kraftwerk and Pink Floyd in the first 
place.  All the Orb have done is re-hashed a bunch of old ideas, given it the 
coorperate touch, and watched their bank accounts rise.  And suckers like 
you fall for it every time.

Thank you for shareing.

{snip}

and so i retort...

I like most of what comes in the mail box from s/f raves, and a few 
other lists that i'm on, it tends to give me something neat to read 
while i'm on the phone...

And all day long i talk with lazy negitive people, who whine and 
winge that they cant get things done, when a little common sence and 
reading of the manual will solve their problems.

Its a pitty that a few people on the sf raves list folow the same 
behavior. Most people who e-mail the list are positive caring 
THINKING people who realy want to leave this place better than they 
found it, thus the rave and anjoy raving.

Perhaps those who enjoy cutting things down, insted of giving an 
ailternitive, i suggest they theu go into the army, where they will 
mingle with like minded souls...
 
Or, if they also happen to be verbose, and have no real content, i 
recomend that they hang out around the state cap, or wash dc.

There are lots of list and news grps that kater to the flame bait/ 
negitive attitude that some immature people toss around.

Please if you want to bash some ones posting (like mine), e-mail the 
person directly. If you wish to bash a show/dj, how about saying 
something that you LIKEd about past perforamaces, or another 
group/person at the same show.

I DO like some of the 'negitive information' that comes acoss the 
list, places that had a chill room that was to small, 'un cool' 
locations etc etc. These people are not realy into the scene,
etc etc That is information that is usefull to us.
 

Its realy nice to see a 'review' of the partys/stuff. The more a 
reviewer posts about the partys/music /things that i goto/do the more 
i can guage 'oh this person likes concerts/sounds that i like'.If 
they think its good, perhaps ill make the effort to check it out.'

 
Please remember that all your messages to to LOTS of PEOPLES PRIVITE 
mail boxes, not just to some generic bord that we logon to, your 
opinion goes to a wide range of people, Some of how agree, or not, or 
dont care,some who dont want it.

Please try and remember that the messages are making a visit to some 
ones privite space, accurate helpfull information is (most of the 
time) allways welcome.

PRIVate feed back is welcome...

Oh you will.  you will. :)

I personally LOVE just bouncing up to ppl and getting them enmeshed in
totally screwy conversations.  I used to be really shy and withdrawn, but
over the past few years I've come to see that there's no reason for me to
be that way ... so I seem to be making up for all those lost opportunities.
There's nothing I like more than draggin a whole bunch of ppl I've just
met back to my place after a party for a nice long chill session with nice
trip hop and a joint or four ...

but I do agree that it can be tough when the music is just a-poundin'.
that's why I like a chill room!

Over the last few weeks, several different Detroit-based labels have
contacted me about doing a video or video-related projects for them.
I work for a large special effects house in LA, so I cannot take on
these jobs.  What I can do is recommend to them who might be able to
do the work.  We are looking for broadcast quality work of various
lengths.  MTV-esque videos, promotional videos, film & video performance
displays, and CD-Rom's are all possiblities being discussed.

The labels that are currently looking are +8, Planet E, and Transmat.
Please do not bombard them in regards to this, as that is specifically
what they wanted to avoid by having me screen talent.

If you are interested, please contact me and we'll talk.

Hey everyone!

I'm spinning this Saturday (June 24th) at the Rococco Showplace from 6-9pm.
The party is being put on by Oracle on behalf of the Art Teco multimedia
show at Fort Mason.  I have never seen the space, so I don't know what it's
like, but if you feel like starting your night a little early it should be
pretty cool.  I will be playing techno/trance/electro/old skool etc....  The
Rococco is located at 165 10th street between Mission and Howard..  And
there is no cover charge so....  Hope to see you there!


Jon

Don't mean to stretch an already taut thread out any further, but all this 
bickering over whether or not such-and-such a troupe is better than group s                  
so-and-so seems terribly silly to me.  If an argument about artistic merit is
to be conducted, fine.  But the only time you can pull off a discussion like
that is when both parties maintain a mutual/irreverent/playful level of respect
with each other.  If that's the case, then quibble away. But once the discussion
descends into defiant posturing, it almost never goes anywhere; both sides
just dig their heels in deeper and spit farther.  So I propose that from now on,
if an argument turns into a venom exchange, it should just be dropped                      
altogether.  Does anyone else feel that way?
I'm reminded of an old David Bowie quote: a journalist asked him who was the best
(best) band in the world at the moment, and Bowie scratched his chin and said,
"You are aware, I hope, that nobody gets any medals at the end of all this?"
Just my thoughts. 
See you all out there,
Timothy

Since everyone here is so friendly and helpful recently:-),

I have a friend coming out to visit for three weeks and was wondering if 
anyone knows of a good place where she can get cheap housing (<$100/wk). 
It would have to be in the East Bay, preferable around Rockridge. Thanks in 
advance for any advice.

        the prevailing tool of postmodernist art is pastiche, the sampling
and recontextualizing of past works to form a 'new' work.  Knowing that
there is no such thing as an avant-garde (as 'everything has been done
before') we are left to, (to paraphrase Jean Baudrilliard) 'play with the
fragments of shattered modernity.' thus, pink floyd weren't 'original' nor
were caberet voltaire and nor are the orb..there is no such thing as
'originality' anymore, just the effecting and stimulative and articulate
recontextualization of past works of art...Cabaret Voltaire, btw, got their
name from the dadaists who were some of the original non-originals.

Well I am just now starting serious work on it.  The last 2 weeks have 
been very hectic for me, what with finals, projects due, and moving out 
of my dorm to an apartment.  BTW, soundgod, you said you couldn't provide 
a system for 3 days, is it a possibility to borrow your system for as 
long as possible and then just rotate stuff in and out.  Anyway, sorry 
there hasn't been any activity lately.  However, the date is confirmed.  
The last weekend of July.  Starting around 9:00pm on Fri and going til 
Noon on Sunday (I think).  Well catch ya all later...

Just wondering if any thoughts about the breakdance circles (for lack of 
a better term) that occasionally crop up @parties.  To my displeasure, I 
saw a lot of these at All Together Now last Saturday night.  Though 
actual breakdancing doesn't usually occur, you do find w/in these circles 
a lot of bodywork and generally showy (rehearsed?) moves.  IMO, those 
performance circles are the place where hip hop (which I love) 
and house clash.  These circles, like the ones formed around the two 
half-naked, fire-breathing female performers throughout the course of the 
evening, disrupt the flow of energy on the dancefloor, focussing it in 
one specific location, instead of having it flow through everyone -- as 
equals.  The phenomenon of BD circles probably has something to do with 
the relatively young age of a lot of the party-goers -- it definitely has 
something to do with a spirit, albeit usually friendly, of one-upsmanship 
that might lead to... fire-breathing breakdancers?  Hopefully not.

Berkley Aquatic Park:

o  Hwy 80 to Berkley

o  University Ave (Blvd, St, whatever) Towards the hills

o  Right on 6th   ("                ")

o  Right on Bankroft (sp)

o  Left at deadend 

o  you should be there


I copied these directions from an answering machine recording and the woman
spoke pretty fast.  I've never been there, but I feel confident I can find
it with what I have.  Take your chances.

Dance circles have been around since the beginning of house.  Chicago
is still going strong.  There *is* a lot of attitude being thrown there,
it comes from the street.  It's a world many people can't relate to.

I enjoy watching the circles.  Some of the guys are pretty good dancers.  The
only thing I dont like about them is when I inadvertantly walk into the
middle of one as I am making my way through the dance floor.

so universal.

I have to say that from the wilds of the East Coast, I have not enjoyed
these flame wars.  However, at the risk of trolling, allow me to posit that
the depth of conviction in which one's opinions are held are no protection
against stupidity or ignorance.  There were quite a few folx who were
convinced that slavery was divinely instituted, and sadly, there are still
people who are convinced that ravers are drug-addled maniacs.  IMHO, one is
convinced less by the tenacity with which one clings to his or her beliefs,
as by the reasonableness of the arguments offered to support those beliefs.

Just my .02.

Yeah,
	I went over and tried to talk to the guy who was doing it.
	His friends agreed and he in his drunken stupor said OK I'll stop
	then when I left, he went right on doing it.  It's a difficult thing
	to police drunk people, soime people when they get alcohol in them
	get reallyu pig headed. We told him that they could draw the police,
	that the party was without permits and that he could ruin it for
	everyone, he didn't care, all he cared about was gettin his own
	kicks by setting off fireworks, it was a similar guy that caused
	the fire at the let freedom rave party two years ago.  That time
	he clearly saw the ramifications of his actions (I hear he didn't
	go out for a long time after that).  Why is it always young guys
	that seem to want to burn things down, must be testosterone poisoning :)

I know it's unhealthy to repily when not reading all of the threads but this
sorta hits close to home....

What Ya'll call break dancing circles are in reality called Firewalking...

Firewalking is essntally predefined moves that are (or at least are tried) to
be performed in sync with the tremenosly fast moves (ie. 130-180BPM).  It's a
great excersice and helps create that naturall high.

As for additudes it depends on the raver, i guess.  I've been going out since
91 or 92 and I've ALWAYS been firewalking...  Back in 92' yea I threw
additude but now it seem that I tend to show respect 4 fellow firewalkers and
actually hooked up w/them to trade moves and vice a verse....

A lot of the affronting seems to stem from not so hot dancers...

So if ya see me, ask me, I'll be more than happy to teach ya a move or
two....

Peace and peanut butter,
Adam...

Hey, I read in the Chron today, testosterone makes guys *happy* and *friendly*.
  I don't always believe the Chron or big science, but it goes to show you,
chemicals aren't bad, but people can be.

wow!
i don't know what else to say.
this was my first sunset party, and in fact my first party on 
the west coast ... and what a party!
it was without a doubt the most beautiful location i have ever seen
and was only made better by all the friendly, smiling faces everywhere.
i just moved here from north carolina, and i had heard all kinds of
rumors about how great the san francisco scene is ...
well, let me say, they are all true. :)
thank you everybody who made it such a great party, and special thanks
to mike clay for taking me - you're the greatest!
keep up the smiles!

	In fear of getting flamed, I feel I should say my opinions on 
	this subject. It is something that I think about at every party 
	I go to. Also the following comments are only my own opinions, 
	and should not be associated with anyone else from Harmony and 
	or Beautfiul People. (Cause their opinions may differ greatly.)

I feel that circle dancers have a great talent or gift of being able to 
move the way they do. I know that if I tried to do any of the things 
that they do I would probably end up with a broken back! So, I totally 
respect that! It is just like skateboarding or stunt-biking, it takes a 
lot of talent. 

However, one thing I think is a draw back to circle dancing is the 
amount of space that it takes up. I can deal with it a big huge parties, 
but not at smaller parties. Sometimes there just is not enough room. I 
just can't seem to find justification to take up half the dance floor to 
watch one dancer at a time. I feel that everyone should dance together. 
But at the same time I can understand  dancers wanting watch eachother, 
to learn new moves. Basically I feel that dancers should keep in mind 
how small or big the party is, and if there is enough room then great, 
go for it. But if not, then save it up for a later time.

*That is just something I thought should be brought up about circles. 

******Peace, love and harmony to all,*******

Dear Throck;

	If your refering to the fireworks at Sunset, I knew the person 
who hadem. The guy is over here from Scotland, and his trip got cancell 
due to a death in the family. I'm half Irish, and there are sertate 
traditions about celebrating with fire/fireworks, especially where dance 
is concerned, sorta dancing with farie fire. These tradition I think are 
more prevalent in Scotish heritage. JUst explaning the why, but I agree 
its like sending up a flare, here we are come bust us,. But I still 
respect it, and like it, something silly & frivious, farie like about it 
that just delites the hell out of me.

Greg,
I totally agree with what you said.  Personally I prefer parties without 
circle dancing.  I feel more energy on the dance floor when everyone is 
dancing rather than having alot of people standing around watching, 
focussed on one dancer, rather than the whole.  For me I get the biggest 
rush when I can let myself go enough to experience as much of the whole 
room of dancers as possible, and it really adds to the rush when I feel 
like others are doing the same.  Speaking of standing around on the dance 
floor, I'd also prefer it if people are to have LONG conversations, they 
don't do it in the middle of the dance floor.  
For me the biggest problem I have with the circle dancing is also when 
there is a lack of space.  I've felt circle dancers pushing me, so that 
they can make their circle.  I don't think all circle dancers will do 
this disrespecting of others space, and I'm pretty sure that there are 
plenty of circle dancers who choose not to do it when there isn't much 
space.  For those of you out there, thank you,

:)

This touches a really critical issue.  How much should we refrain from 
expressing ourselves and trying to create the best possible atmosphere at 
parties due to concerns about the law?  Facility owners have been known 
to throw people taking drugs out of their buildings because they didn't 
want the reputation with the cops of a place that allows drugs.  I'm sure 
if they just turned people over to the cops directly it would create even 
more of a favorable impression with the powers that be.

Wouldn't it be nice if we lived in a society where we had the freedom to 
do what we want as long as we didn't hurt anyone else?  I for one believe 
in change and am optimistic we may eventually get there.  But it won't 
happen through self-censorship.  It *will* happen through enough people 
taking a stand for freedom.  Let the fireworks begin!

Treason in the Park!

Sunday, 18th June. Glasgow Anarchist Group organise a
Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ) in Kelvingrove Park in direct
defiance of the draconian Criminal (In)Justice Act.

The TAZ, a fund raiser for the Scottish Federation of Anarchists
and the Glasgow Solidarity Centre, was an all day rave and
very well attended. The venue, a bandstand in a public park,
is under threat of being sold off by the council for private
development so the TAZ showed that the bandstand should be 
left as it is, for use by those who own it - the people of
Glasgow.

The event was very  well attended and the police kept well away.
As well as music, food was provided and anarchist stalls
did well.

A good day was had by all.

The other problem I have with these fireworks is the guys that usually set them
off have more investment in being seen as Promytheous rather than giving
the crowd a need fireworks display, so they set them off right next to the crown
where more than once I've seen the fireworks burn somebodies backpack or
land on someone's head.  Also if you are drunk or dosed YOU SHOULD NOT BE
OPERATING FIREWORKS plain and simple.  If we were at the beach and someone
who knew what they were doing wanted to put on a display and shot them up in a
responsible manner I'd be less negative about it but the bottom line is that
almost all of the fireworks experiences I have had at parties in the last
3 years have ended in  either something catching on fire or sending up
a locator flare for the Police (Pt. Richmond in '93 as an example).

although i've seen some cool circles, they usually mean this to me: 
invasion of my space, unwanted and unprovoked negative attitude, 
needless competition...they've usually happened at shitty parties where 
i've seen fights break out. but, like i said, i *have* seen cool ones 
that were just people showin' what they could do. i dug those. 

to sum up on coicles - for a good circle:

drop the attitude

smile

be friendly

do what you do

respect other dancers.


sounds good to me. :D

Just a quick note on MOBY at the Trocadero

His opening act - didn't enjoy them.  They we a thrash metal type
band from the UK.  What were they thinking when they signed them
up to tour with MOBY.

MOBY - Hmmm.  He was ok, nothing interesting.  His cover of
a Doors tune drove me out of the Troc.  Not really the $13
at the door, but that is why we have disposable incomes.

Unfortunately, people exercising their freedoms rarely allow themselves
to be aware of the hurt they inflict on others.  Too busy being "free"
to notice.  Whether it's breakdance circles destroying the sense of 
unity, or fireworks bringing on the heat, or ambient DJs jarring spaced
out tripsters with punk tunes (sorry allen ;), or cigarette smokers in 
nonventilated venues, or people who cut the line, stand or sit down on 
the dance floor, or incesssantly blow their whistles...

Realistically, we usually can't do whatever we want without hurting 
*someone*.   Of course, "hurt" can range from mere annoyance to 
absolute terror; everyone has different sensibilities.  And there are 
those who say that some pain is good for you.  Thinking about all this, 
it's easy to see why humans have been killing each other so much over
the years.

But I've been amazed at how well the rave scene has managed to "police" 
itself while maintaining a strong sense of freedom.  The paradox of 
promoting  unity while respecting individuality is a challenge, and it's 
been fun to see it work.

Raving has nothing to do with anarchy.  They operate more as TAZs - 
Temporary Autonomous Zones, which are self-GOVERNING.

Fortunately, there are different kinds of parties we can go to.  Some 
will welcome nitrous, others won't.   Fortunately, like-minded folks 
have the ability to throw their own parties with their own preferances,
and each of us can choose where to go and feel the most "free". 

Just some semi-random thoughts.  Speaking of freedom, a belated happy 
Gay Pride day to all those who value our ability to love one another.

It would be great. But I would suggest that the fireworks at Sunset posed two
problems: 

Attracting the police. 
It seems that that the Sunset parties have a rep with
the police for being "responsible" parties. So the police don't really care.
However, if we pose a fire risk... then they may feel compelled to interfere
and not only does that wreck the party at that moment..but it can potentially
wreck future parties as well. Why test this particular boundary?

Fire. 
Dry grass. High winds. Fireworks. Seems like a nutty combination.

I would suggest that discouraging fireworks would be called intelligent 
self-policing, not self-censorship. Although not necessarily so, when I think
of censorship, I primarily think of the censorship of ideas. 
When I think of self-policing.. I think of reining in innapropriate actions. 
Of course, what may be inappropriate to me may be appropriate to 
others, I guess. However, since fireworks *may* have a direct effect on
everyone's ability to enjoy a party, I personally deem them inappropriate.

I saw a "women's circle" at the New Years Gathering of '93
there were all types of Women going in and out and it seemed real
empowering for them as the circle fed each and every woman who entered
supportive energy in realizing her self expression.  I think if you have
circles like this, they can do wonders but you have to drop attitude
CONPLETELY.  It might be interesting rather then trying to "ban" circles
maybe we should try to influence their development in a positive way.
One way to do this is to form your own circles when you see a real
attitude circle forming, invite everyone into your circle and let
the energy radiate out, eventually a balance will be reached,  I think at
a good party their can be room for circles for people who want to dance
that way, they just have to be sensitive to the whole.

I think raving has everything to do with anarchy.  What is the 
definition of anarchy?  An organization that prohibits certain
behavior and mandates others _by threat of force_.  This force can
range from death to imprisonment to confiscation, and is always
equivalent to torture (prison is psychological torture).

What threat of force do underground raves use?  I've seen people 
asked to cool their behavior, and I've seen people asked to leave.
Were these requests backed up with guns?  No, and you can't call
the police when you yourself are outside the law.

It is difficult to maintain a functioning anarchy when one is still
potentially subject to the rules of a government.  This permits 
a "safety valve" kind of mentality where, if I judge that the risk
to me of letting something continue is more than the risk of calling
the cops in and us all being found out, I can do that, and sidestep
the problem.

Voluntary organization is anarchy.  Involuntary organization is not.

Therefore, the effective difference between anarchy and state-slavery
is this:  In anarchy, for ethics (standards of behavior) to exist,
all must consent to them and abide by them; no one is held to a standard
of behavior they don't espouse, and there is no guarantee of another's
behavior but your knowledge of the other.  Under a state, ethics are
guaranteed by the threat of force, but there is no guarantee that the
other person has consented to them, and the ethic is only as powerful
as its weapons of enforcement.

Non-anarchists often confuse ethics with their enforcement, and think
that if people weren't threatened with death they would all become
serial killers (like the Army, or Dow Chemical?) or something.  Ask
yourself this: if the government were to vanish tomorrow, how would
YOUR ethics change?  Never mind what other people might do, what would
YOU do differently?

Is there some evil, dark, slavering beast lurking within you, waiting
for all the black-and-white cars to disappear so it can slouch out
of your subconscious and commit unspeakable atrocities upon your friends?

Or do you just want to smoke dope in public places?

Never mind the state: what do YOU want?

I would like to add that this year in particular will be a lot more 
dangerous than most, fire-wise -- all that rain we got gave us a helluva 
lot more grass than usual, and the winds have been rather capricious, with 
frequent gusts at times... I was in Sac a little over a week ago, and on 
those days that were hot and windy I heard *many* firetrucks racing about.

Not that I'm at all against fireworks -- Susan & I bought lots driving 
out here -- cool things like Saturn Missile Batteries, among others.

Who's go'in?

I'll be there around 4:00 p.m.  wearing wine colored jeans (most likely).
I'm not sure what shirt, if any...(if not I have nipple rings)....Oh ya, um,
I have a pony tail, held by a colorful schrunchy....and Birkenstocks. 

Say Hi to me if you see me.

Erm .... your dictionary is far different from mine then, which defines
anarchy as "a state of society without government or law", or "confused
disorder", and defines anarchism as "a doctrine urging the abolition of
government as the indispensable condition for full liberty".

I see no sign of either of these definitions when I'm at a rave.  Raves ARE
self-governing, not anarchistic.  The rules at a raves do tend to be a
little more fluid than the rules of society, but they do exist.  They are
also common sense and most people are perfectly happy to abide by them.

Laws which class a reasonably safe "drug" such as marijuana with things
like heroin, yet allow the legal sale of nicotine and alcohol, THAT is
something I can't abide.  On the other hand, I've never seen a rule at a
rave I didn't agree with....once I knew the reason for it.

>that seem to want to burn things down, must be testosterone poisoning :)

Actually, there was an article in yesterday's chronicle indicating that
estrogen and/or low testosterone levels actually caused agressive
behavior, and that giving people w/ low testosterone artificial
testosterone actually increased their friendliness level, generated a
calmer, more positive outlook on life, etc. The article also alluded to
the direct role of estrogen in aggression....

After all, what kind of hormonal changes are going on in women during
PMS? They certainly ain't getting a big dose of testosterone, that's
for sure... :-)

Basically, the article contradicted the usual testosterone mythology.
IMHO, most men that act in what we'd call "testosterone poisoned"
fashion are just acting out the "caged rat" role defined for them by
industrial society. Such pathological behaviour is more a disease of
modern society than some fault of being male.

I see the whole "testosterone poisoning" myth as yet another way that
society is attempting to reduce and diminish the uniqueness and
importance  of maleness. After all, you cannot subjugate the natural
male and  put them into industrial servitude unless you subvert male
energy into something unnatural (obsequiousness, defferring attitudes,
the wearing of suits, the shearing of hair, the covert feeling of
wanting bite the hand that feeds you, banale servitude, a meaningless,
mind-numbing 10 hour workday, being taught from a young age that the
male must shoulder the burdens of the world) and then attempt to
brainwash people into thinking that the maleness that rebels against
such bullshit is something primitive and stupid that can be cut out and
removed like a spare appendix. All in the name of productivity and
progress. Well, we all know that's a bunch of crap. 

Cage the wild beast and he will snap. Cage the beast and you get the
sick dominator society we now live in in which the oppressed male finds
unhealthy release in human subjugation, hoarding of
foods/goods/wealth/land, the raping of earth and woman, and highly
detatched, deeply impersonal, and genocidal acts of warfare and
aggression. Cage the beast and you get rows of lonely men sitting at
the bar, failing to understand the changed nature of the world and the
conspiracy against them.

Detachment, free floating aggression, domination, subjugation, anger
and rape aren't the natural outcomes of "maleness" -- it's more a
malignancy we define upon ourselves.  And one is continuing the cycle
by telling "men" that it is their maleness that is at fault, that the
cage doesn't exist, and that there' something wrong with themselves.

Some of you may be interested in this...



Friends & Colleagues:

Happy Summer Solstice!

For tens of thousands of years, this has been a day of celebration, of
dances, of weddings and feasting.  The Sun, at its zenith, graces Earth with
a full complement of light.  The Earth responds in love, and grows rich and
green.

To celebrate this event, we would like to announce the conversion of the
Zero Circle, from CyberSamhain.  (This is the event & VRML model that is
discussed in the "Technopagans:  May the Astral be Reborn in Cyberspace"
article in the July WIRED.)  Originally built in Labyrinth VRML, Scott Young
has begun its transformation into VRML 1.0.  The first revision of this
magickal world (450K) is available at:

http://hyperreal.com/~mpesce/circle.wrl

More information about the structure of the site can be found at

http://hyperreal.com/~mpesce/samhain.html

Please come and visit; we will be adding many features to it in the weeks
and months to come, and look forward to meeting you there.

IO EVOE, and Blessed Be!

Mark Pesce (mpesce@netcom.com)
C. Scott Young (necron99@netcom.com)

Oh, my.  Braino (like a typo) of the century here.  I meant to 
say that about _government_ but my head got way ahead of my fingers
and skipped the intervening sentence.  (Thanx to Karen for pointing
this one out.)

I hope people got what I meant, which should read "What is the
definition of _government_?"

Sorry about that.  Talk about putting a speed bump on the road
to comprehension...it wasn't even a _funny_ braino.  Oh, well.

	Another note on Moby. Altough as an artist (as in writing and

	he actually quite good. One tape I have of a Radio show he 
	spun has him showing off with the best of them; moments of

Safeway shut down the Making Waves stage at the corner of Market and Duboce
where the German techno DJs were supposed to play.  First party I've been to
that's been shut down by a grocery store :(...  Unlike the cops, you can 
boycott Safeway (if you're not already doing so).  The rest of the Making Waves
festival is going strong, and I think you can still make the "Sunset
Dance Party" by the Ferry Building which goes until 10pm.  

The DJs are still going up and down Market St in one of those fake cablecars,
which is a pretty funny sight, and will be playing at DV8 tonight, $10...

I haven't had time to read the entire thread about circles but I wanted to say a
few things:


1)  Circles can be very powerful as Geoff implied.  If a group forms a circle 
    with a specific intention, and the circle has a gap, shit happens.  I've 
    experienced this in many groups settings and it's not to be taken lightly.
    We've had fires break out, energy distortion, and definitely a lack of
    unification among other things.  

2)  I've also inadvertently walked or danced through circles or even unknowingly
    danced too close to them.  I find that there is a break in a continuous 
    flow of energy when encountering these firewalkers (or whatever they're 
    called) but at most parties, you can find pockets of energy flowing or 
    stagnating too, so what's the diff?!  Attitude is one thing but I haven't
    really encountered this.  I find it's more of an alienation in not being
    able to connect with the dancers _except_ in showing appreciation by
    watching.  Since I like things on a more reciprocal level, I find it
    unsatisfying after five minutes and move on.

3)  At my community dance jams and with my dance collective events where 
    there's about 100 people, after we're warmed up and are moving about the dj 
    stops the music and we form a circle (this includes _everyone_). 
    Announcements are made re:  housing, support, events, etc. and then we go 
    around and state our names.  Then we join hands and dance one entire song  
    together as a group with the intention of making eye contact, smiling and 
    seeing who we are with at this dance to make it go off.

    In doing this, the awareness is raised removing us from an individual atti-
    tude to a group consciousness and sometimes we do the "rope dance" where we 
    get entangled and work as a group to untangle.  It requires consideration
    to _not_ pull eachother's arm off and to _not_ get carried away with the
    momentum if it's too energetic.  While it'd be difficult to do at a rave 
    w/such a large group, I agree with Geoff that it'd be good to develop one 
    in a positive manner.  Again, at the prompting of one particular song
    that is played almost every gig, people skip, hop, hold hands, hug and dance
    _around_ the "freestyle" dancers who are in the center of the circle.  Maybe
    we could try something like this to encompass the group energy sometime?

    At the end of the Basics anniversary a few months ago, one of the organizers
    asked for a circle to form.  Immediately, I joined hands with others and 
    followed only to be rebuffed by some people who thought I was plain wierd!  
    It's too bad, because after an amazing party like that, to hold hands 
    and feel the shared glowing energy with others is really something to
    behold...if you think huggEing someone is good, then you're in for a real 
    treat!  When I think of some shared moments from various circles, I know 
    that they should never be recreated but only built upon and improved.  

Happy Summer Solstice Day and remember to let your light shine :)

Love,
Diane

I saw a "women's circle" at the New Years Gathering of '93
there were all types of Women going in and out and it seemed real 
empowering for them as the circle fed each and every woman who entered 
supportive energy in realizing her self expression.  I think if you have 
circles like this, they can do wonders but you have to drop attitude 
CONPLETELY.  It might be interesting rather then trying to "ban" circles 
maybe we should try to influence their development in a positive way. 
One way to do this is to form your own circles when you see a real 
attitude circle forming, invite everyone into your circle and let
the energy radiate out, eventually a balance will be reached,  I think at 
a good party their can be room for circles for people who want to dance 
that way, they just have to be sensitive to the whole.

hmmm ... funny that you think raves have everythign to do with TAZs and 
nothing to do with anarchy, lee, cuz i think TAZs (and many raves) have 
EVERYTHING to do with anarchism.... (of course, we can say "anarchy" and 
"anarchism" are two different things, "anarchism" being organization and 
social interaction and cooperation without hierarchy.

i don't know who came up with the definition of anarchy as using "the 
threat of force" - i've never heard that before! anarchism to me implies 
no coercion.  

okay, some BSP...
from The Little Red Rave Book:
"I've also come to realize that good renegades are a perfect example of 
practical anarchism.  People come together - some offer music, equipment, 
some offer food, drink, art, positive energy...at a good renegade we look 
out for each other - interdependence.  We know tht sometimes nasty shit 
can go down, especially since sometimes we can't party in the safest 
spaces, as we're relegated to the edge of industrial wastelands where 
we're (hopefully) free of police.  We watch out for each other, don't let 
people wander off alone, take care of someone if they are hurt.  And we 
transform the wasteland, the parking lots, the pavement, the abandoned 
buildings into ritual playgrounds full of color, energy and life (Or if 
we are lucky we find a space in woods and fields!)"

okay, end quote.  
but, yes, i do understand that most dictionaries define "anarchy" as 
chaos and disorder, rather than the more "political" definition , or more 
"social" definition of cooperation without hierarchy as well as "do what 
thou wilt an ye harm none" (hmm...isn't that the wiccan saying...could 
there be a connection here ...? ;) )

well, i could go one, but i've already gone on a lot :)
but if anyone is interested in discussion this with me please email me :)

take care everyone!

  I haven't been reading much mail lately, but this whole Orb thread 
caught my eyes.  I just wanted to make a few comments on it, since it is 
getting a bit out of hand.

  o I thought the show was fantastic, full of VERY intense energy. 

  o The energy was so intense at times that I'm sure many of the upper 
    crust 'Groovemasters' couldnt handle it.

  o The music they played could hardly be classified as just techno. 
    There orb is in its own class.  The combination of dub, trance and
    sample mania make for an incredible sound.  If you don't like it... Oh
    well.

  o Personally I'm not suprised at all the flames and various comments the
    show caused.  It was so intense, you just HAD to talk about it. I 
    know I've been talking about it for days now.  

  o Finally I'm suprised people aren't freaked out at the direction SF is 
    heading in.  3.5 years ago I went to a rave at the Warfield. It was
    all ages and went all night. 1.5 years ago I went to the Orb there.
    If the ushers saw you without a 21+ bracelet on after 2am, you
    were kicked out.  Now, June 1995, they had to stop the whole show,
    turn the lights on, and check everyone for a handstamp, essentialy
    ending the party at 2.

    This is getting ridiculous people.  The current trend is not a good one
    and if people don't start taking notice, soon all our rights will
    be gone.  It happened in England, and it could happen here.  It would
    not suprise me if in 5 years there were even more anti-dancing laws 
    on the books.

...or maybe it's just hump day... ..  .

I know the Orb has gotten good to excellent reviews elsewhere, but 
they just didn't impress me here.  I was all set for a soaring experience,
but the group basically plodded through a two and a half hour performance
before a dodgy, inert audience.  

DJ Lewis played about an hour and a half of mostly flat, not very fast
breakbeats -- he peaked out at not much more than 135 bpm, which surprised
me given the reports of his sets from elsewhere.  I didn't recognize
anything except the long mix of "Keep House Underground" (a new one by
O. Voom on Touche, he's also been collaborating with Juan Atkins recently
I believe).  The crowd basically shuffled around, not really knowing what
to do.

The Orb played a somewhat more industrial-sounding set than I'd been
expecting, but frankly it didn't really move me very much and it seemed
to have more oomph when the rhythm section (bass and drummer) were on
board.  And when Dr. P briefly stepped up to the 1200s for a short spin
about halfway through.  La Luna is a small place and I gather they
couldn't do their full light show; it was mostly the rotating spots
and Intellabeam-type stuff (no, they're not Intellabeams but you know
what I mean).  Very nice but somewhat restricted in their effect.

I guess the best part of the show for me was the seven or eight minute
Blue Room segment, but I'd sure hoped for something new and different
to surprise me.  

I don't think it was me, quite a few of my friends were less than fully
engaged in the show here, though the crowd mostly stayed until the end,
sort of waiting for something to happen.

Perhaps it was just overinflated expectations on my part, but that's the
way it goes.

Hmmm...I saw the Duboce site going strong around 6. I did however, watch a
FULL batallion of S.F.'s finest drop in on United Nation's Plaza to vent some
pent up testosterone driven anger(the HELL with what the Chron says!) against
Food Not Bomb's.  I actually watched one of the riot cops mocking a passerby
(because the guy had long hair and was dressed "strangely") and then go on to
show his fellow officers with hand gestures how he'd pull the guy down and
rough him up. (kicking and elbow jabbing gestures) They all thought it was
really funny.


Interesting note: The SFPD now has an officer with a video-cam recording riot
type events.

i think this discussion is now pretty much completely off topic. the 
'circles' that are being talked about in this thread now have nothing 
at all to do with breakdancing circles, other than their physical 
shape.

Mainly, I see a big difference between *autonomy* and *anarchy*.

> (of course, we can say "anarchy" and 
> "anarchism" are two different things, "anarchism" being organization and 
> social interaction and cooperation without hierarchy.

Well, I don't know much about "anarchism", but I won't let that stop
me from forming an opinion about it.  Basically, I'd say that
if you think you can have cooperation without some form of hierarchy
then you are just fooling yourself.  True, you may not need an
oppressive force to keep things organized, but there will always be
a shared value system, or unwritten rules of conduct that the
group allows itself to be led by.  And some "laws" will be more
powerful than others.  It doesn't matter to me if people obey the
laws voluntarily or not.  Once we become organized, and in sync with
each other, we have bought into a hierarchical power structure that
controls our behavior.

At raves, the music, the vibe, our shared desire to connect with
each other... these are the things that lead us and become more 
important than our individuality.  Those who put their own
personal agendas first work to destroy the unity, structure, and
meaning of what a rave is, in favor of anarchy.  I agree that less
heirarchy is good.  At raves, the pyramid is pretty flat, but it's
still there.

"Anarchism"?  Sounds like an attempt to legitimize the concept of
anarchy as a practical (i.e. "good") thing.  To say that ravers
are participating in anarchy because they just happen to be doing
what they want to anyway  renders the term meaningless to me.
Look at that school of fish, swimming in perfect formation, what
anarchy!  

True anarchy, like chaos, is a big part of the way the universe
works.  I see no need to denegrade these rather abstract concepts
by trying to make them fit into a political package.

So in conclusion, I really doubt that we disagree very much at
all.  It just comes down to semantics, in which case I tend to
rely on my dictionary.

ObRave: Thanks to everyone at the Equinox yesterday afternoon and night.
It was beautiful.  Hugs to all I didn't hug while I was there.

Here follows a big discussion about the anarchy thing.  There are no
sentences containing the word "Orb" or "circle".  You've been warned.

On a bright and warm day just after the solstice, Lee Fogel said:

Anarchy _permits_ autonomy but is not sufficient to produce it.  That
effort must come from within.

"True communication is only possible between equals."  Communication
is necessary to cooperation.  There are degrees of co-operation, and
my experience from living and working in co-ops of various sizes and
kinds is that the less hierarchy, the more communication, and the more
co-operation.  We had food on the table, and a place to live, and I 
don't think we were fooling ourselves ("That's not a building!  That's
a collection of soggy cardboard boxes leaning against a tree!").

I guess if you believe that people who voluntarily choose to co-operate
with each other have automatically formed a government and passed a law,
I don't know what to say.  I don't believe that choosing to live in a 
certain way automatically oppresses everyone else who doesn't.

> Once we become organized, and in sync with

I can choose to look at it that way, and most of us do, because we have
no experience with any other form of interaction.  Can we leave, alter,
protest against, climb on, or swing from the structure without being
beaten up or jailed by its members?  Coercion is the defining feature
of the state -- or, stated by someone much more famous than I, "Political 
power grows out of the barrel of a gun" (Mao Zedong)

Maybe my personal agenda is to dance!  The unity you talk of is not
enforced by a hierarchy: we've all been to totally vibeless parties
where people's agenda was "project a 'tude" despite best intentions
of the people throwing the gig.  I've also seen people having amazing
fun at parties thrown by "in-it-for-the-money" promoters.

It's you, and I, that make it happen.

You are correct: calling oneself an "anarchist" doesn't really say anything.
What will you do once the boys in blue go away?  (I think I've asked this
before.)

> So in conclusion, I really doubt that we disagree very much at

Who wrote it?  What agenda did they have?  I tend to use it for the sake
of commonality, but (since I don't believe in objectivity) I take many
definitions with a grain or two of salt.

Diane,
Your community dance jams sound really cool.  These people most be ravers 
at heart whether they go to raves or not.
I like the experience of both, 
having some stucture to help bring us together, 
and a less stuctured dance with full spontinaety, having the feelings and 
the the natural free flowing of the dance bring us together.  
Like Lee says there is always some structure at the partys whether spoken 
or not. 
I ok with different degrees of it as long as it helps us experience.
Hopefully a harmonious experience, where kaos and order can live in harmony.
For me dancing is alot about that, I'm dancing out of mind (hopefully to 
a merging of a shared state of mind) in a 
controlled way, keeping myself in tune with my mind at the same time.
Dancing allows me to be crazy (a fun crazy) and very sane at the same time

So in conclusion, I really doubt that we disagree very much at
all.  It just comes down to semantics, in which case I tend to
rely on my dictionary.

So I guess that's why I'm finding myself thinking "yeah, what he/she said" to
each post I've seen on this subject. :->

While TAZ and anarchy make for some really interesting discussion, for me
neither political model really touches the essence of how a rave exists - it
certainly isn't a pure manifestation of either. There's a balance between the
communal and individual that I haven't experienced anywhere else, including
"real life." Every other scene (or whatever) I've encountered has exaggerated one
at the expense of the other.

Has anyone experienced the vibe, the connectedness, and the tribal aspects of a
rave and not asked themselves something like "wow! what is it in me that's resonating
with this?" Likewise, it's really pretty rare to see someone stand in the middle
of the dance floor endlessly tripping on their personal specialness. 

I recently visited the Monterey aquarium, and besides becoming uncomfortable at
seeing all the living creatures in such cramped quarters, I was really disturbed
by the cylindrical tank packed with anchovies swimming around and around and
around in circles head to tail.

Part of respecting other people involves respecting other people's
self-expression. I wasn't there for allen's unconventional ambient room set, but when
I heard about it my reaction was "that's great!" Most of the "best raves I've
been to" involve bumping into the unexpected in some form. I was glad to hear
I'm not the only one who enjoys watching circle dancers when they're not edging
others off the floor, physically or otherwise.

That said, I think the scene here and everywhere has plenty of vitality left for
some time to come, and I'm still convinced this summer will be a significant one
for us all!

take care!

Since everyone's been throwing cool quotes about, though I'd add one that I 
saw last night on this show about Kurt Weil. It went something like:

"I'm not so concerned about the differences between serious music and
light music, I am concerned about the differences between good music
and bad music."

Yeah.. It was kind of annoying hearing 170 bpm on 4 floors NON STOP.. Don't
get me wrong, I love techno- but most of the stuff played last night got
pretty annoying after awhile.

Although the Vibe was intense

how does being in sync = hierarchy?  there's a big difference between 
"power-with" and "power-over."  and i think a vibrant anarchist community

needs.  when i go to a rave i definitly feel the collectivity, but i'm 
still an individual with my own individual needs and personal dance floor 
experiences.age. >

well, one could always say "social anarchist..." or techno pagan 
anarchist witch! :)

and when the boys in blue go away, will the boys in blue inside ourselves 
be gone?  i think then i'll dance and feast and work cooperatively :)

Precedence: bulk

i very much respect 
and understand
your point.

along with it
what about my freedom to
not smell the aweful smell
that crawled up my nose
because the works
were fired so close (in) the crowd?
what about my freedom to
enjoy the party
without my worries
of fire
injury
and the man?
what about the freedom of those
(not me)
who do not like fireworks?

again, i respect and see your point.
i like it.
another replying to your missive
mentioned parties for 
every kind of dancer
perhaps
parties with fireworks
can be announced beforehand
so one can choose
whether to go
or not.

another point brought up by another
is the guy was drunk
and another person wrote
drunk people should not operate
fire works.
i agree.
because i have seen
fingers blown off
by irrisponsability.

and i am not saying this is universal
but some of the people i see drunk
at parties
are some of the same people
too wasted
to dance
or be 
and many behavior
that is rediculous
stupid
hurting
demeaning
and ugly.
it seems that the only people i notice
that behave in ways i would not like to approach
are the drunk people.
actually,
i would prefer parties
without alcohol use (voluntary).
i know this may infringe on rights
but if people were a bit more responsible 
with their use
i wouldn't feel this way.

responsible drug use
of any drug
is vital
for a good scene
good vibe
and good life.

love to all... throcka

   Another hot weekend in store: tonight is supposed to be the last Pure
   Space (in 111 Minna instead of Sound Factory); Friday, try Progress
   (can't be rained out at Big Heart City) or the ingeniously-named party
   at 111 Minna. Also, outdoors will be Frequency 8. Then Saturday, both
   Kundalini and Organic have good lineups plus Megatripolis presents the
   next installment of their parties... Finally, Sunset is supposed to be
   weekly now, and Bulletproof's boat party also takes off Sunday.

That was Sensor, a "thrash, speed metal, funk" band as described by my
friend, who works at Polydor (sp?) and who got us into the show via the
label's guest list. They've got a song that's played on Live 105.

Don't you think that at least a couple of Moby's soungs sounded speed
metalish? And, Moby even got a mosh pit going a couple of times! (Before
the show I  told my friend that it was okay to move up in front of the
stage since people that listen to Moby don't mosh. Oops! Maybe it was the
Sensor fans. :) )

>MOBY - Hmmm.  He was ok, nothing interesting.  His cover of

>at the door, but that is why we have disposable incomes.

The Doors? I thought that was a Led Zepelin cover, not to mention his
covers of  Lynard Skynard (Sweet Home Alabama), Prince (didn't specifically
recognize it), and Jimi Hendrix (Purple Haze, of course). JH was mentioned
in the SoCal Raves post about the Moby show down there, so I knew what to
expect. Yeah, he's a sucko guitarist, but I found it amusing. He said that
he was trying to "open" our minds, since San Franciscans have a narrow view
(I guess of what to expect from him). A interesting statement in comparison
to the lead singer in Sensor saying what a great town this is, since all
the great music comes here (implying diversity as well as richness in my
mind).

I'm a former drummer, so I got off on all the percussion and drum solos
(two drummers!). He seemed to be making a statement, perhaps in reaction to
all the criticism of his exclusively using his DAT last year. He would put
the mike away from his face when the voice sample was played, and he
"wrote" a live piece at the end. I thought I saw him once play his keyboard
out of sync from what I heard, but he could have been inputting something.
Oh, and you gotta love his standing up on the stunt keyboard, hands and
head raised slowly up to heaven! 8)

I thought his "disco" songs (as he called them) went off with really high
energy, and made up for the other experimental (hee, hee) stuff. I'd say it
would been worth $13, but no more.

Geoff, I hear what you are saying.  Clearly with fireworks as with 
anything else, care should be taken so as to ensure the safety of users and 
those nearby who might be affected.  I did not mean to imply in my 
previous post above that ravers should just do whatever they feel like 
without taking these factors into consideration.  The original message I 
was responding to did not object to fireworks based on safety concerns, 
but said that they should not be used lest it give the cops an excuse to 
bust parties, and it was this sentiment I was addressing.

I might add that I have personally seen fireworks lit many times at 
parties, and never personally witnessed them causing a problem, so it is 
certainly possible for them to be used in a positive manner.  I still 
remember at my very first rave, the Toon Town on New Year's Eve three and 
a half years ago, someone lighting off some large cone-type fireworks 
that emitted showers of sparks in at least a five foot radius.  Mind you, 
this was *inside* a fairly crowded building.  Everyone I saw seemed to 
really enjoy and appreciate this spontaneous act of anarchy and 
celebration.  Each time a device was set off, a circle would form around 
it, with people dancing in and around the showers of white falling 
sparks, kind of like the breakdance circles being discussed on sfraves, 
only without the attitude or competitive flavor those circles sometimes 
have.  I found it quite beautiful, and it increased my enjoyment of an 
evening that already stands out in my memory as one of the most 
incredible nights of my life.  This use of fireworks may not have been 
*entirely* safe, but then few things are.  Certainly they are less 
dangerous overall than drug use, and probably no more objectionable to 
the powers that be.

And here is some CyberSafari News from David Dei at
our Virtual Rondavel in San Francisco....

The Truly Amazing Confirmed List:

A Picturetel 4000 system on both ends connected via ISDN (Integrated
Services Digital Network), with crew supplied by Picturetel

An original Buckminster Fuller Fly Eye Dome for our Safari Command at Fort
Mason, SF

Telkom support of our SA ISDN connections.

Aztec South Africa support of a CuSeeMe link (Deon Botha has agreed to lug
his apple quadra into the Woodstock venue to demo CuSeeMe before the cyber
illiterati).

The Well, Sausalito, the place where the internet was invented , has
supplied us with two ISDN accounts onto the Internet, as well as agreeing
to reflect CUseeMe transmissions.

Headware (Paul Rousouw) is setting up an 5DT dataglove to trigger MIDI
signals - probably the roland synth sitting in our module - Michael Mantra
of Tranquil Technology Music wants to compose real time ambience with Paul.
Also me, Schwann, doin some cyberart live on-line at the CyberSafari.
Just visit IRC and  mssg me on 'Schwann' Saturday nite GMT,
or try #rave  

Documentary coverage of the Cybersafari by Big World Cinema with input from
African Connections, SF.

Endorsment by President Carter for our electronic petition for
international conflict resolution and non-violence. This petition will be
launched from our booth in SF, onto the Internet.

I do believe we have critical mass. What we will be doing over the next
couple of days, is fine-tuning our technical support and finalising the
program line-up - all you internet prima donnas will have ample time to wash
your virtual hair.


David is running the Frisco chapter of the RAVE.
So if ya need some more technical details e.mail him,

er uh, excuse me pardon me, the Well may take credit for a lot of
worthwhile things, but considering that for the first five years of
its existence it was only hooked up by UUCP it can scarcely claim

Well here is the scoop

The outdoor location had no plugs for me to run the equipment I would
use. It would have been too difficult to bring a big enough generator
also.


AND--------THE PLACE WAS INFESTED WITH MISQUITOES


So they moved it and gave me 360 volts in a wall socket.
That outta be enough-----


call 916-484-4006

See you there, I'll be by the equipment almost all night, or dancing by
the DJ. Come say "HI!"
I'm wearing a green shirt and blue jeans, AND A REALLY BIG FAT SMILE, as
always!

I was at that Toon Town as well, the place was packed with maybe 7000 people.
Imagine the loss of life if the place had caught on fire and there was
a stampede to the door.

NO they are far more dangerous than drug use, if you OD or if your drunk
and you drive maybe you kill yourself and perhapse a few other people
by crashing into them, the fire that was started by a fool with fireworks
two years ago at let freedom rave had the potential to kill or injure
dozens of people, you had to be there to realize how fast the fire spread
and got out of control, it was literally one of the miracles of the
rave scene (coupled with the fact that there was lots of bottled water lying 
around and some sober people acted quickly) that a tragedy was avoided.
Don't get me wrong, I _love_ fireworks, I have friends that put on major
displays with their fathers at 4th of july, under the right conditions with
back up systems so that if something goes wrong the emergency can be handled
they are OK but I don't think a "OH gee, I'm sorry" cuts it when your
in the hospital with second degree burns on your scalp cuz some stupid person
wants to set fireworks off in your vicinity and doesn't warn you.

I personally believe that people have the right to keep and bear arms, but that
doesn't mean they should bring them to raves and shoot them off in the air.
(some people do this as an expression of celebration) call this censorship?
Perhapse, but I also believe "AN IT HARM NONE, do what thou wilt", fireworks,
guns and other items that have the capability of injuring loads of people at
one time should not be operated in crowds by drunk or dosed people, period.

i would describe Senser as more of a (fundamentally) hiphop band, with 
a metal *and* a techno edge. they've got two vocalists, one male, who 
raps his vocals, and one female, who sings and raps occasionally  some of 
the beats in their tracks are very electronic...they've been around 
for awhile (from scotland); check 'the key' for a *killer* track, they 
had another single remixed by J Saul Kane (aka Depth Charge) which was 
pretty wicked. their sound falls in a few different categories but 
their tastes are right on. i believe the main vocalist did some vocal work 
with Trans-Global Underground as well...

Some people see that as a civil rights infringement. 
Think of it as Big Brother watching you... and possibly opening
a file on you. It happened in the 60's.. could still happen. It
caused a shit load of trouble when Mayor Daley did it at the Chicago
Demo Convention back in '68.

Yeah.. It was kind of annoying hearing 170 bpm on 4 floors NON STOP.. Don't
get me wrong, I love techno- but most of the stuff played last night got
pretty annoying after awhile.

Although the Vibe was intense

it DOES still happen.  if the police have footage of you at many demos, 
especially if you speak or appear to be an "organizer," they definitley 
want to knw who you are!

take care (and watch your back!)

i'm saying that renegades are organized ANARCHICALLY - meaning that there 
is no one giving orders, no one getting paid, everything is done 
voluntarily - someone may be "coordinating" but that does not mean they 
are a boss or superior.  lots of thing are organized anarchically but are 
just not defined as such.

this is also A LOT different than a school of fish.  fish swim together 
by instinct.  do we organize renegades by instinct?  and even if we do 
gather together non-hierarchically by instinct (maybe?), we often still 
have to 
overcome hell of state/patricarchal/etc. conditioning to learn to work 
together.> >

but anyway...
i hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!  i'm off to the woods!!! (yes, 
i'm actually leaving sf - and gettiing beyond berkeley! can it be true?!)
and if you're interested, don't forget the free mumia torchlight march on 
monday at 7:30 at u.n. plaza.

Peace Sister!

I'm glad you had a great time, remember though, this scene isn't really
about drugs, but about life and the pursuit of happiness in the warm flow
of music and friends.  The drugs?  Well, whether or not you do them, it's
important to remember that they are not the driving force.

You might want to strive to the positive on the forefront of your email,
and the drug stuff off-line.

I say this with this in mind:  A young raver died recently after taking
MDMA and his father posted on SF Raves.  It was sad.  I can't shake this
feeling that he might continue to read the stuff here to try and vilify his
feelings toward raving.  I wanted to tell him that I was sorry and that the
scene really wasn't about drugs, but I didn't.  If he does read the list,
then maybe we can convince him of our intentions.  If not, it's still a bad
idea to post blatently about drugs.

Just some words to think about.  Again, I'm glad you managed to have fun
even though you got burned the first time.

Out!

Tony

Uh. Excuse me, but this is *BULLSHIT*. The Well, if anything, is a
late-comer to the internet, though they certainly were an important and
early UUCP hub beginning in the early/mid eighties; however, UUCP and
USENET does not equate to INTERNET.

Reminds me too much of Netscape Communication's publicist for Marc
Andreesen -- they claim he singlehandledly invented the internet, world
wide web, and mosaic, even though he prolly couldn't program his way
out of a paper bag if his life depended on it. I really don't see why
people need to lie about this sort of thing -- it's quite disrespectful
of the multitudes of unnamed and generally unknown scientists and
engineers that labor in obscurity and relative poverty...

Other than that, it sounds like an interesting event. I'd like to see a
video-wall link-up where each wall holds the projection seen from a
camera at a remote site; meanwhile, the remote site sees the view from
the wall where they're being projected. Might get some real 
interesting infinite-space-across-the-world video feedback as you see
images from your wall projected on the other side of the earth, and
back again...

With that said, I will go back to work...

Hi, everyone... I am posting this message for a friend and fellow raver who

If anyone in the east bay is driving there tonight, and wouldn't mind an 
extra passenger, with lots of positive vibes, then please call 
Kate at 510-654-8642

Thanx in advance, on her behalf.

	Does anyone here really think we are going to change peoples attitudes towards
Raving by doing nothing? If the police tape a demonstration and you happen to be organnizing you should be prepared and WILLING to deal with the outcome.  If the general
public saw us standing up openly defending our rights at the expense of our person I
believe we would command more respect. Why dont we have more events benifitting
the enviroment, feeding the hungry, and generally passing our energy into 
positive channels. People would take notice. God knows if we collected canned food
donations at the door of most parties there would be quite a bit of food for people.

I dont organize myself but it sure seems like a lot of us are college students and
even more of us do this as a purly extra curricular activity.  Dont we have 
plenty of resources available to create real positive change.  Maybe I'm
all wrong and our collective apathy will lead to our demise but I would be really
proud to contribute to a party whose sole cause was charitable.

Sometimes the self interests and egotism in raving really makes me sad.

P.S.-If you want to flame me send it to my mailbox or if you are involved in
     a charitable cause let me know.

I heard that was Talla 2XLC...he definitely won the fashion award for the
night, whoever it was!

I thought the night was a really good opportunity for me to hear DJs and
music that simply do not get heard in the bay area. The stuff upstairs in the
main room was commercial happy hardcore crap, but it was interesting to hear
what is the dominant style in europe, and the music in the smaller downstairs
room was rather boring for me too (fast mainstream/minimal). Jeff Mills (whom
I took a picture of for a fan), though a bit far removed in his playing from
the UR stuff he's written, kept things changing and chaotic, shuffling
records one after the other. Joey Beltram was pretty noisy at times (good),
taking more of a mixer's approach than a DJ's, and Blake Baxter was a bit
more conventional, playing fuller tracks and keeping a standard 8 bar layout
throughout, though BB was the only person the whole night to play a track
that wasn't a 4x4 beat. No, wait, scratch that, the guy who played last down
there played some "funky breakbeat" track for a second. All in all, the music
down there wasn't much of a surprise if you've ever heard Derrick Carter or
Mystic Bill play. 

An important night for the well-rounded dance music fan and/or historian, but
I don't think it really laid out the variety of techno available these days.
It was essential for me to hear what the people who have made the music that
has influenced me (and a lot of you sfravers out there) all these years (this
is speaking of the Tresor room). I did not even mind paying $10 to get in.

Did the gardening club ever happen there? How about the "American DJ" room
(you know, Markie Mark, Jon Williams, etc.)? I could find neither.

Um, my perspective on how the show went had more to do with the variety of
musics that the Orb have put out since their first couple. I felt the
performance focused on the Blue Room/Little Fluffy Clouds aesthetic while
underreprestenting the more experimental and ambient excursions that have
characterized their later releases and projects. Alex Paterson has said in
interviews that they've moved beyond the DJ and rockstar traps that were
figures of their first tours, but you wouldn't have been able to tell from
seeing them last Friday. The "Lucky Saddle" quote and the Juno Reactor track
were nice surprises, though.

The Orb haven't played longer than they played here in any other city.

Underagers have not been allowed to stay up past 2 in SF for a while now. I
look at it as an underhanded curfew law rather than a paranoid "anti-dancing"
force. Why don't those who live in SF who are concerned take a more active
approch to the problem than talking about how much it sucks while they watch
the kids getting hustled out of the venue?

Went to Eighth House last night, at the Cat's bar and 
grill on Folsom.  It was five dollars.  This place is 
really interesting; some times I've been there and 
there's a contingent of Harley riders in the front 
room, and a club crowd in the back.  It can 
really draw an interesting mix of people.

When we got there, there was a live ambient 
performance.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch their 
name, but if anyone knows I'd love to know.  Really 
interesting synthesized sounds with some live vocals 
sung on top.  There were some nice visuals also, they 
seemed to be videotape but went really well with the 
music.  As part of the performance, Faith, Charity, 
and Hope (dressed in white toga-like gown thingies) 
mingled with the audience, spreading their goodwill.  
I think I might have been baptized into their 
religion.  (If you organize, can you get 1st amendment 
protection for taking drugs?  ;)  )  They stopped 
playing about midnight.

The second show was billed as "Freaky Chakra vs. 
Single Cell Orchestra".  My guess from this name was 
that it might be a little like the old-time dueling 
piano shows from years ago.  (Turned out to be not far 
off!)

About fifteen minutes later the music started in the 
back room.  The two blue women that everyone had 
noticed come in earlier began a short performance by 
dancing and throwing around some flaming batons . . .  
this started the crowd moving all at once!  The fire 
marshall would have had a cow.  The room heated up 
instantly as everyone started to _move_.  I was a 
little confused at the start since I could see a 
couple of the Sunset people (Solar & Loren??) in the 
mix room upstairs, but the music sounded live.  It had 
that unmistakable percussion sound of Freaky, a 
complex beat compelling me to dance.  The musicians 
turned out to be up in front, and they were mixing 
back and forth.  The two artists were talking back and 
forth at times; I was told that they hadn't even 
practiced very much, but they made it seem _so_ well 
thought out!  The songs mixed very well into each 
other.  I was really impressed with how well they 
worked together to make some amazing music, and would 
love to hear a tape of the music again.  I don't know 
the music of SCO very well, but nearly all the stuff 
Daum was playing sounded new.  Quite a treat!  I don't 
think that there was a point longer than a few seconds 
when both weren't playing something.  There were some 
incredible sounds being made last night, and the 
energy was really nice to feel.  Lots of smiles 
around, and loud applause when they were done.

If anyone in SoCal is reading this, a must-see for 
Saturday night down there!!

Altogether a very nice evening.

Take care,
Matt

Dear throcka,

	I feel as you do on many of the points above.  I too have often 
noticed that parties where there is a lot of alcohol consumption tend not 
to be good parties.  I think the key here, as you hinted, is responsible 
use of freedoms, so others (like yourself) won't feel inclined to get rid 
of them.
	As I basically said before, safety is another issue, and drunk 
people operating fireworks is generally not a good idea.  Certainly, as 
Maui said, the venue of Sunset with lots of dry grass might not have been 
a wise place to light off a device.  These concerns are legitimate 
"self-policing" (to use another's term) matters, and are not censorship.  
Self-censorship involves responding to actual or feared societal or official 
disapproval, and it is this doing of the cops' dirty work for them that I 
object to.
	While others should respect your presence as much as possible, it 
is also up to you to (politely) let them know if they are doing something 
that bothers you (i.e. lighting a firework off too close and assaulting 
your nose with the smell), so they can refrain from further disturbing 
you or an agreeable compromise can be reached.  Respectfully, no one can 
stop you from worrying, nor is that anyone's responsibility but yours.  
People can always find something to worry about, right or wrong.  
Likewise someone who simply *doesn't like* fireworks, shouldn't be able 
to suppress them, just as someone offended by the words of another 
shouldn't be able to censor their speech.  In a free society, free speech 
and free expression necessarily take precedence over the "right" not to 
be offended, unless we're talking libel or actual injury.
	A good solution here, as both you and Lee Fogel touched on, is to 
have different parties for people who enjoy different ways of partying.  
That's free market (dare I say it) capitalism at work.  :)
(Wait, wait -- let me get my flame suit on!!)

	Love to friends & family,

Philip, aka theta-blip, who runs the 8th house, is a transplant
from the Seattle Goth scene. He's had some success over the past
year mixing in some of that serious gloom with SF techno/trance
events.  Like the punks, anarchists, h/zippies and break dancers
amongst us, he's glommed on to the vitality of raving in a bid
to instill new life into some tire attitudes.  Now people who wear
black and don't like to smile can go out and have fun too.  :)

Me neither, but yes, I thought they were very good.

Turned out to be an interesting evening of ritual and performance.
Most of the people seemed to be into it.

These guys were my reason for being there.  A live techno
performance by 2 of SF's hottest talents.  No DATs or computers,
lots of improvisation and live mixing of sequences.

Weren't these 2 naked blue firedancers at some other show recently?
Did some country sent them over as part of the UN celebrations?

Galen and Lorien were just playing around with the lights.  Solar

They did a great job, especially considering that one of their
main keyboards had crashed just before the show.  Pretty cool to
see Miguel (Single Cell Orch.)  reroute MIDI and audio cables
*during* the set.  If you watched their interactions, it was
apparant that they screwed up a lot of things, but it still sounded
pretty good to me.  They would have played a lot longer if Daum
(freaky C.) hadn't just erased 1/3 of his MIDI disk material by mistake.
After 45 minutes, they were done and Daum waved his hands saying that
they didn't have any more material for an encore.  Nevertheless,
they gave into our demands and managed to improvise a really good 
10 minute piece for us.  I'm not a big fan of live techno, but
this show turned out to be a lot of fun.

Wasn't the "original" babylonian and the hebrew calendar based on 13
months? Only to be supplanted with a completely illogical 12 month calendar
by Christians that thought the number 13 was evil?  (but leap years and
leap seconds and months of different lengths and crazed regularity was
"good").

Well, if you can run the GNU emacs program (you're on netcom, so you can),
type Alt-X calendar and issue some of the following commands. You can
toggle around in Islamic, Hebrew, Mayan, as well as the good ol' Gregorian
(as in bonking your self over the head with a 2x4 while chanting ave maria)
calendar.

If you delve into the sources
netcom:/usr/local/lib/emacs/19.19/lisp/calendar.el, you'll also note some
interesting background info:

;; This collection of functions implements a calendar window.  It
;; generates a calendar for the current month, together with the previous
;; and coming months, or for any other three-month period.  The calendar
;; can be scrolled forward and backward in the window to show months in
;; the past or future; the cursor can move forward and backward by days,
;; weeks, or months, making it possible, for instance, to jump to the
;; date a specified number of days, weeks, or months from the date under
;; the cursor.  The user can display a list of holidays and other notable
;; days for the period shown; the notable days can be marked on the
;; calendar, if desired.  The user can also specify that dates having
;; corresponding diary entries (in a file that the user specifies) be
;; marked; the diary entries for any date can be viewed in a separate
;; window.  The diary and the notable days can be viewed independently of
;; the calendar.  Dates can be translated from the (usual) Gregorian
;; calendar to the day of the year/days remaining in year, to the ISO
;; commercial calendar, to the Julian (old style) calendar, to the Hebrew
;; calendar, to the Islamic calendar, to the French Revolutionary calendar,
;; to the Mayan calendar, and to the astronomical (Julian) day number.
;; When floating point is available, times of sunrise/sunset can be displayed,
;; as can the phases of the moon.  Appointment notification for diary entries
;; is available.

--------------------
Here's the "help-on-mode" info for emacs calendar mode (C-h m):
--------------------

Calendar Mode:
A major mode for the calendar window.

The commands for cursor movement are:

       C-f  one day forward           C-b  one day backward
       C-n  one week forward          C-p  one week backward
       M-}  one month forward       M-{  one month backward
       C-x ]  one year forward        C-x [  one year backward
       C-a  beginning of week         C-e  end of week
       M-a  beginning of month      M-e  end of month
       M-<  beginning of year       M->  end of year

       g d  go to date

       g j  go to Julian date         g a  go to astronomical (Julian) day number
       g h  go to Hebrew date         g i  go to Islamic date
       g c  go to ISO date            g f  go to French Revolutionary date

       g m l  go to Mayan Long Count date
       g m n h  go to next occurrence of Mayan Haab date
       g m p h  go to previous occurrence of Mayan Haab date
       g m n t  go to next occurrence of Mayan Tzolkin date
       g m p t  go to previous occurrence of Mayan Tzolkin date
       g m n c  go to next occurrence of Mayan Calendar Round date
       g m p c  go to previous occurrence of Mayan Calendar Round date

You can mark a date in the calendar and switch the point and mark:

       C-@  mark date                 C-x C-x  exchange point and mark

You can determine the number of days (inclusive) between the point and mark by

       M-=  count days in the region

The commands for calendar movement are:

       C-x >  scroll one month right   C-x <  scroll one month left
       M-v  scroll 3 months right    C-v  scroll 3 months left
       .  display current month        o  display another month

Whenever it makes sense, the above commands take prefix arguments that
multiply their affect.  For convenience, the digit keys and the minus sign
are bound to digit-argument, so they need not be prefixed with ESC.

If the calendar window somehow becomes corrupted, it can be regenerated with

       C-c C-l  redraw the calendar

The following commands deal with holidays and other notable days:

       h  give holidays for the date specified by the cursor
       x  mark notable days
       u  unmark dates
       a  display notable days

The command M-x holidays causes the notable dates for the current month, and
the preceding and succeeding months, to be displayed, independently of the
calendar.

The following commands control the diary:

       m  mark diary entries          u  unmark dates
       d  display diary entries       s  show all diary entries
       M-x print-diary-entries  print diary entries

Displaying the diary entries causes the diary entries from the diary-file
(for the date indicated by the cursor in the calendar window) to be
displayed in another window.  This function takes an integer argument that
specifies the number of days of calendar entries to be displayed, starting
with the date indicated by the cursor.

The command M-x print-diary-entries prints the diary buffer (as it appears)
on the line printer.

The command M-x diary causes the diary entries for the current date to be
displayed, independently of the calendar.  The number of days of entries is
governed by number-of-diary-entries.

The format of the entries in the diary file is described in the
documentation string for the variable diary-file.

When diary entries are in view in the window, they can be edited.  It is
important to keep in mind that the buffer displayed contains the entire
diary file, but with portions of it concealed from view.  This means, for
instance, that the forward-char command can put the cursor at what appears
to be the end of the line, but what is in reality the middle of some
concealed line.  BE CAREFUL WHEN EDITING THE DIARY ENTRIES! (Inserting
additional lines or adding/deleting characters in the middle of a visible
line will not cause problems; watch out for end-of-line, however--it may
put you at the end of a concealed line far from where the cursor appears to
be!)  BEFORE EDITING THE DIARY IT IS BEST TO DISPLAY THE ENTIRE FILE WITH
show-all-diary-entries.  BE SURE TO WRITE THE FILE BEFORE EXITING FROM THE
CALENDAR.

The following commands assist in making diary entries:

       i d  insert a diary entry for the selected date
       i w  insert a diary entry for the selected day of the week
       i m  insert a diary entry for the selected day of the month
       i y  insert a diary entry for the selected day of the year
       i b  insert a diary entry for the block days between point and mark
       i a  insert an anniversary diary entry for the selected date
       i c  insert a cyclic diary entry

There are corresponding commands to assist in making Hebrew- or Islamic-date
diary entries:

       i h d  insert a diary entry for the Hebrew date corresponding
                to the selected date
       i h m  insert a diary entry for the day of the Hebrew month
                corresponding to the selected day
       i h y  insert a diary entry for the day of the Hebrew year
                corresponding to the selected day
       i i d  insert a diary entry for the Islamic date corresponding
                to the selected date
       i i m  insert a diary entry for the day of the Islamic month
                corresponding to the selected day
       i i y  insert a diary entry for the day of the Islamic year
                corresponding to the selected day

All of the diary entry commands make nonmarking entries when given a prefix
argument; with no prefix argument, the diary entries are marking.

The day number in the year and the number of days remaining in the year can be
determined by

       p d  show day number and the number of days remaining in the year

Equivalent dates on the ISO commercial, Julian, Hebrew, Islamic, French
Revolutionary, and Mayan calendars can be determined by

       p c  show equivalent date on the ISO commercial calendar
       p j  show equivalent date on the Julian calendar
       p h  show equivalent date on the Hebrew calendar
       p i  show equivalent date on the Islamic calendar
       p f  show equivalent date on the French Revolutionary calendar
       p m  show equivalent date on the Mayan calendar

The astronomical (Julian) day number of a date is found with

       p a  show equivalent astronomical (Julian) day number

To find the times of sunrise and sunset and lunar phases use

       S  show times of sunrise and sunset
       M  show times of quarters of the moon

The times given will be at latitude `solar-latitude', longitude
`solar-longitude' in time zone `solar-time-zone'.  These variables, and the
variables `solar-location-name', `solar-standard-time-zone-name',
`solar-daylight-time-zone-name', `solar-daylight-savings-starts',
`solar-daylight-savings-ends', `calendar-daylight-time-offset',
and `calendar-daylight-savings-switchover-time' should be set for
your location.

To exit from the calendar use

       q  exit from calendar

The variable `view-diary-entries-initially', whose default is nil, can be
set to to t cause diary entries for the current date will be displayed in
another window when the calendar is first displayed, if the current date is
visible.  The variable `number-of-diary-entries' controls number of days of
diary entries that will be displayed initially or with the command M-x
diary.  For example, if the default value 1 is used, then only the current
day's diary entries will be displayed.  If the value 2 is used, both the
current day's and the next day's entries will be displayed.  The value can
also be a vector: If the value is [0 2 2 2 2 4 1] then no diary entries
will be displayed on Sunday, the current date's and the next day's diary
entries will be displayed Monday through Thursday, Friday through Monday's
entries will be displayed on Friday, while on Saturday only that day's
entries will be displayed.

The variable `view-calendar-holidays-initially' can be set to t to cause the
holidays for the current three month period will be displayed on entry to the
calendar.  The holidays are displayed in another window.

The variable `mark-diary-entries-in-calendar' can be set to t to cause any
dates visible with calendar entries to be marked with the symbol specified by
the variable `diary-entry-marker', normally a plus sign.

The variable `calendar-load-hook', whose default value is nil, is list of
functions to be called when the calendar is first loaded.

The variable `initial-calendar-window-hook', whose default value is nil, is
list of functions to be called when the calendar window is first opened.  The
functions invoked are called after the calendar window is opened, but once
opened is never called again.  Leaving the calendar with the `q' command and
reentering it will cause these functions to be called again.

The variable `today-visible-calendar-hook', whose default value is nil, is the
list of functions called after the calendar buffer has been prepared with the
calendar when the current date is visible in the window.  This can be used,
for example, to replace today's date with asterisks; a function
calendar-star-date is included for this purpose: (setq
today-visible-calendar-hook 'calendar-star-date) It could also be used to mark
the current date with `*'; a function is also provided for this: (setq
today-visible-calendar-hook 'calendar-mark-today)

The variable `today-invisible-calendar-hook', whose default value is nil, is
the list of functions called after the calendar buffer has been prepared with
the calendar when the current date is not visible in the window.

The variable `diary-display-hook' is the list of functions called after the
diary buffer is prepared.  The default value simply displays the diary file
using selective-display to conceal irrelevant diary entries.  An alternative
function `fancy-diary-display' is provided that, when used as the
`diary-display-hook', causes a noneditable buffer to be prepared with a neatly
organized day-by-day listing of relevant diary entries, together with any
known holidays.  The inclusion of the holidays slows this fancy display of the
diary; to speed it up, set the variable `holidays-in-diary-buffer' to nil.

The variable `print-diary-entries-hook' is the list of functions called after
a temporary buffer is prepared with the diary entries currently visible in the
diary buffer.  The default value of this hook adds a heading (composed from
the diary buffer's mode line), does the printing with the command lpr-buffer,
and kills the temporary buffer.  Other uses might include, for example,
rearranging the lines into order by day and time.

The Gregorian calendar is assumed.

Apparently you have gotten hold of some bad information. Reality suggests
that there is a gray area between 18 and 21. By underaged I did mean under
21.

But the question remains...

Old enough to go to war but not old enough to dance all night.
Maybe the 18-21 year olds should exercise their right to vote and get some of 
these silly laws changed.

Well maybe if some concerned SF citizens contacted some people on
the board of supervisors and explained how they felt and told them
that unless some changes were made they would not vote for them
and tell everybody else not to vote for them. That usually gets the
ball rolling.

Just for 'fo:  Talla 2XLC is one-half of the industrial dance act called 
"Bi-God 20".   I'm Not surprised to hear that he's a good DJ, some of 
Bi-god's early stuff is *still* really great.

   Just came back from the show.  I wanted to get an idea of what others
had to say about the show.  I think I was expecting a bit much, or
something.  Not that I didn't enjoy myself, but I had expected to see a
little more than lights and turntables.  

   I was amazed with the lights, though.  WOW!  Some time went into that. 
there were some really high points to it.  I am sure there still are. 
It's still going as I type this.  I'm sure it should go for quite some
time.  Probably, I would suspect, til 3 or 4 or even after.  

   I have never seen anyone get into playing a mixing table like this
guy.  You would have sworn that he was playing guitar for like, one of
those jumpy up and down rock bands!  hmmm.

  I think I was expecting to see more cool gear.  2600's, Moogs, maybe a
20 foot wide Polyfusion, I don't know.  There was not ONE keyboard to be
seen.  Oh, well.

   I've seen DJ's spin Orb sets before, and the lights were the only REAL
thing that set this apart from a DJ'ed set. All the lights were behind
them, too, so you couldn't even make out their faces.

   I did manage to get a couple of shirts.  I like the blue one the best 
:)

What happens is, the E stores the microwaves, then when you swallow
it, and the e dissolves, the microwaves escape and cook your
internal organs.

You've heard of all those deaths where people overheat and they
suffer major internal bleeding and organ collapse?

Microwaved MDMA is the cause.

I sure hope Single Cell v Freaky Chakra makes it up to the Northwest.
Or at least that I see them do this *some*where !  I can sympathize
about nerves fraying during a set (erasing a third of a MIDI disk, yow!).
I just came back from an allnighter in the hills outside Portland,
played about an hour right after sunrise.  Just when I was mixing out
my third track it suddenly developed a previously unknown skip-in-place!

The show must go on . . .

Does anyone know the guy who does the pirate radio station out of
Berkeley?  It was fm 10?.? (in case there is more than one).  I met
him at eighth house but already lost his name and number.  

I suppose a private email response is appropriate.

	The goth scene is much more than mentioned above, it not about a
bad attitudes and sneering at people. It's a direct projection of all the
death, violence, fear & the constant threat of global & regional NBC(Nuclear,
Biological & Chemical) warfare that prevails on our TV's, Street's, &
Homes. My opinion follows; its societies way of saying that death & 
descruction are here to stay, better make friends with them. I think many 
of us at one point in our lives found either the music of people like 
Killing Joke, Cabert Voltaire, Sister's of Mercy, Fad Gadget, Bauhaus  ..etc 
comforting and interesting. It took the sting out of what we saw, & read 
about the our worlds atrosities. If you don't agree with me fine, but ask 
yourself; if you listened to or listen to this music, whats on your mind 
when your listening, what are you feeling inside. I maybe wrong as I 
otfen am, but I don't think I'll be too far away.

I never felt 'comforted' by this music.

But dancing with an ethereal super fluidity in a
trashed abandoned store basement at 4am surrounded
by the walking dead used to be pretty fun.

Goths know how to Go For It at a party.
Another flavor of Vibe.

Just a short addition to this. My friend went to a protest in the city.
They were marching to police headquarters protesting the killing of erin
williams by sf cops. During the protest someone came up to him and snapped
a picture of his face and then ran off. This person did that to many other
people at the protest. I think its obvious that this kind of thing wasn't
just for a photo albulm. This surprised me somehow we have a kind of
misconception that in sf in the 90's we are safe.

Peace & Love,

yeah, it's kinda funny that an internet provider with a measely 
subscribership of 10,000 would dub itself the inventor of the 
internet.  at best, they use the medium, and didn't 'invent'
jack shit.

Checking over my last week of mail I noticed that some people have been 
wondering who Tristan is and what he looks like.  First of all, I am not 
Kevin Keiper; I merely use his account.  He is my room-mate and is one 
of my best friends and is a really nice mild mannered guy; unlike me who
is an obnoxious little shit (right?).
    He go's out a lot more then I do because he likes nightclubs 
and I don't (except may be 1015 on Friday night).  I, Tristan, am 6ft 2 
1/2" tall, weigh 180 pounds and have long brown hair.  I am ussually 
found at Sunset parties sitting down right next to the speaker smoking pot.
If anybody wants to ever come by for a smoke, and I love debating me, 
they can catch me their every Sunday for the rest of the Summer.
Love Tristan.

Tristan, you are not "an obnoxious little shit".
Every raver can tell you stories of what they were like before they 
"found" raving. You're like the before picture. ;)

Also-- *everyone* think about this:
People only criticize about others what they dislike about themselves.

Dear All;

	I was at Organic lastnight which was at the Troc, as I was 
sitting there rolling my brains out like never before. I noticed a camera 
crew hangin around the Herbal X tables, so I walked up and asked them who 
they where with; they said MTV. Oh I said, they said they wanted to do a 
story on Herbal X and the SF Rave scene, I told them not to waist their 
time with the Herbal X thing, it's all hype, and most people that I've 
talked to say it gives them a 3 day hangover, which is excessive to me. 
So they actually liked what I had to say and interviewed me, so if you 
see me on MTV(I serious doubt it), saying do the real thing, meaning 
don't use the Herbal stuff, use the chemical stuff, that's me.

	But in general, they are to say the least very curious, so be 
prepaired to one large CCD eye shine in on our scene. The club 
owners/promoters love MTV's unsolisted attention, if they mention the club 
on MTV, that club gets nationwide promo's., and everyone, everywhere 
else, said's this is the place to go in SF for da Techno.

	In general Allison seemed interested, will be subscibing to our 
list, if she can fiqure out how to do it, hehe :). They spent most of the 
night at the club, which I thought was nice, they seemed to really want 
to get a flavor for the SF scene, my spies tell me they where at DV8 the 
other night, and where headed back to NEw York this morning.

	Thats the facts; my opinion; the music industry needs something 
new to talk about, you can only say so much about Courtney Love. The 
potential is that a part of our scene will be brought into the main 
stream, which I feel kinda sucks, but that's what happens. It's happened to 
every music scene I've ever been apart of, it took Punk about 10 years 
but they finally & unfortuately got there. There is one exception Gothic 
never made it.

	Organic by the way was great, overcrowded, no AC in site, but fun 
never the less. The Troc has a killer light show, fog so thick you can't 
see your belly button, and a great sound system. They need more furiture 
though, a lot more. Security seemed mellow, less a few well handled, and 
well needed interventions.

	The SF scene is a funny thing, just when you thing you know 
everyone, you can go to an event, and find out that you only know a 
handful of people. This was my 1st Organic since arriving here 6 months ago.

	The #-Report, my informents tell me that 2 major indenpent 
suppliers got busted this week. Be careful people the man is heavaily 
funded, staffed by educated rightous people, very heavivally equiped, 
and always on. A simple saying I remember growing up that has kept me 
safe, whenever I get lazy, or careless I say this to myself "Better safe 
than sorry", and it seems to have worked for me. 

	On the other hand there is some killer # out there, stuff that 
makes me reminis, about the # in Florida, which on and average puts the 
stuff here in SF to shame. Well thats all for me, thats enough!!

Depends on how "hard core" your gothic is. What about the Cure or
Depeche Mode? Perhaps these bands are gothic-lite (e.g. they're more
accessible/mainstream than, say, Bauhaus), but they're certainly
somewhat doom-and-gloom oriented, and they're popular too.

Also, I recently saw the movie "The Crow" on Video, and that was a
goth-wet dream if I ever saw one. The fact that you have "gothic"
themes in a widely advertized mainstream movie implies it ain't
underground.

Seems like just about everything "makes it" eventually... I'm looking
forward to the day when technology/media increases the rate of
dissemination to the point where everything is simultaneously "retro"
and "avant garde".

PS: I think people are fooling themselves to think that "rave" hasn't
"made it" when "techno" is the background music for TV commercials
(e.g. the Pirelli one) and music for models to sachay (sp?) down the
runway on TV "fashion" specials ... And this techno-mainstreaming has
happened a lot faster than 60's rock-anthems have made it into TV
commercials (e.g. Janis Joplin's "Mercedes Benz" song, etc.).

We tried to go by Rococco, but the doorman insisted it was invite only 
and that there was no guest list (I've heard that before), but how was it 
anyways?

> 	"kill the poor"

I was working on a design, listening to the radio, and for dummy text 
I typically type in whatever lyrics I happen to hear playing... this 
time it turned out to be "Kill, kill, kill, kill the poor" . I didn't 
think much of it and sent the sample pages out. bad move. big, somber 
corporate  meeting to discuss "Alissa's insubordinate behavior". As I 
tried to explain my innocence in the situation, I found that these 
people do not consider it appropriate to listen to music while 
working! yikes! no wonder they're so grumpy all the time!

OB Rave: my dummy text is much less lyric-oriented

Dear Neil;

	Some great points Neil :), and I feel your right, but the TV commerical 
background started with, one of the Fathers of the Electronic Groove; 
Tangerie Dream, and they are awesome. Check out the Concert for Warsaw 
Poland. Really good CD. See Ya.

Howdy-dowdy all....

I'd have to say that F-8 has been one of the most intimate-underground raves
that i've been to in a bit. some times it's nice to get back to the roots of
searching, wnadering and almost-getting-your-neck broke while accentally
falling off a cliff while searching for the spot.  The DJ sets were pretty
tight, and although the dance floor was basiclly nil (all sand), it was worth
it.
I'd like to say hi-di ho to the Djs and fellow ravers who extended thier
friendship while my crew couldnt make it  (i was the one dancin' off the
rocks by the speakers), sorry names always escape me..  

THe naked guys running around was pretty trippy too....

	Well, I've been reading SFRaves for a while now and finally have
time to add my 2 cents.  I figured this would be a pretty appropriate
first posting for me because if there's one thing I could ever associate
with as much as the rave scene it's Goth.

And then Sir Dave spake thusly:

It's funny, because I would have to agree with both of you.  I guess what
I've gotten out of Gothic music, and what I still get out of Gothic music,
is this.  Sometimes when I'm feeling down, like _really_ down, I'll light
a lot of candles, turn off the lights, pop in Some Girls Wander By
Mistake, lay on the floor and just listen.  When I'm done listening, I
feel a lot better.  I think it's because the music is really cathartic in
a way.  Sure, it's dark and sometimes violent, but that's just the way
that those singers/songwriters express their feelings.  It doesn't make me
more depressed; in fact, it's almost cleansing, like you can get out all
your agression and negative feelings while listening to it.

Dear All;

	Reality check; the Internet was started in WW2; and we owe it
unfortuately to the necessities of war; and was started by the defense
department, so they could link all there systems together, Being such a
wonderful idea, it spread into the commerical markets and is where it is
today; and where it will continue to grow, until its absolutely required
for even the most basic of services, like mail, electric, phone ..etc I'm
personnal looking forward to the day, when all my mail gets sent to me
instanteously and doesn't take 5 days to go from coast to coast, as well
as a cashless society. 

	It was not created by a bunch of peace loving hippies, scientist,
or engineers, it was created for war, by weapons systems engineers, hard
fuckin core people, I should know I used to be one.

re-reality check:  Computers did not even exist until the mid 50's.
There would not have been much to network "in WW2". 

The theme of your point is correct, though:  what is now the internet
was originally started as a defense project.  Most internet histories
trace back to a backbone network called ARPAnet, intended to link
computers at universities (the most prevalent location of large
configurations, mostly from ARPA/DARPA grants) and government sites.   
That was during the late 60's.

Anyone interested in a fairly accurate chronicle of the computer
industry, including the beginnings of the internet, should watch
ACM's "The Machine that Changed the World" series.  It runs on PBS
from time to time.

OBRAVE:  I was at 1015 Folsom last friday & had a great time.  The
first DJ (Tracy?) was a lot of fun.  Whoever came on next was boring,
I thought, to the point where I spent the next few hours dancing in
the 70's disco room!  Met a lot of folks but didn't bump into any
SFravers this time.  For saturday night, we went to F/X in downtown
San Jose.  The caveman dude was there, but not dancing.  We'll be 
back at 1015 next friday..

This is exactly why I liked the idea.  The idea of using the internet
(designed as doomsday device) for promoting peace.  Isn't the quote about
beating your swords into plowshares inscribed on the front of UN headquarters?

Subject: Frequency 8 Kicks!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     Went with a couple of friends to Frequency 8 on Friday and wanted to 
     let you know that these boys know how to do a party right.  With all 
     their bases covered, there's no excuse for it not to go off.  The way 
     they've set theirselves up, I have to say that it's pure love that 
     drives them to do this.  Hauling equipment is tedious, but turning 
     people on to music is even better and they know how to do it all.  
     
     Getting to the site was a journey in itself enlisting trust of 
     whomever brought a flashlight--but once there, it takes a while to 
     take it all in.  I remember starting to walk around the entire "set-up 
     space" several times but _never_ making it all around.  It was just 
     too good and enticing to make it all around--for me at least.  
     
     From the people, to the space, to the music, it was all good.  The 
     lighting they brought in complimented the natural lighting from the 
     stars and the reflection from the ocean.  It was wonderful to discover 
     the site and people's faces as the morning light came with the 
     sunrise.  By the time the sun was up, so were we in every imaginable 
     way!  Talk about afterglows, my friends and I were floating in our 
     celestial bodies all the way to the Sunset party on Sunday, which I 
     had to leave at around 4:30 p.m...another good party ready to go 
     off--which btw is gaining a rep of the place to be even w/some o'da 
     hardcores.
     
     The music at Frequency 8 was more trance but that's what you expect 
     when you go on a "Cybertrance Journey", right?  Though the number of 
     us was relatively small, the vibe was great, and as Adam Fostous (sp?) 
     said (I finally met him!), the smile factor was there too.  I'll save 
     the ratings to Adam ;) (Hey, Adam, do we get a hugometer, too?)
     
     In any case, I just want to recommend a wonderful Friday gig that's 
     inexpensive and has alot of heart in the right place.  A promoter 
     friend of mine was reinspired by what we felt grooving there Friday 
     night/Saturday morning.  Check it out and understand why I'm giving 
     these boys applause.
     
     Have a great week and enjoy the sunshine!
     
     Love, 
     Diane

Obviously Tristan, one of the reasons that the people on sfraves have
such a problem with you is that you don't have your own account. If
kevins provider ever found out. He would lose his account there on a
very perm. basis.

One peice of friendly advice, why don't you watch and listen to how
other people interact at sunset. Thet don't go there to debate. they go
there to smile, dance, ejoy the setting, talk, etc. I've never debated
anything at sunset, or any party for that matter and I don't know anyone
who would want to. Just ask! I would like to meet you though. I like to
see a face behind every name. It helps me communicate better.

Looking foward to an introduction,
      Sound God(Andrew Dressler)


PS Tristan, I think you should find out why you are angry all the time
instead of proving it to all of us that your angry!

Hello,

Just thought I'd report that House Speaker Newt Gingrich has voiced his
opposition to Senator Exon's bill that restricts the freedom of the Internet.

This is consistent with his previous opposition to the Clipper chip, and his
work to establish WWW sites for the Library of Congress.

respect to all,

Gee you got in trouble for "hurling bricks and molotov cocktails" and you
are ignorant enough to be angry at the police for video taping.  I dont
want to be to sarcastic but isnt hurling these things considered an
attempt to take someones life or cause great harm. I'm really
suprised they just didn't kick the hell out of you.  Those police
are human beings also so by venting your anger that way you just
undermined your own cause. oohhh well save bandwidth by emailing

Not me! For an interesting perspective on a cashless society, read "The 
Handmaid's Tale," a story by Margaret Atwood set in the not-too-distant 
future. Everyone gets paid and makes purchases electronically using a debit 
card. Fundamentalist Christians take over the government, and they 
successfully eradicate civil rights by simply 
shutting down the financial accounts of those they don't like (namely women).
Very frightening, and very plausible, unfortunately.  Also, there was 
something floating around the net recently about some guy who didn't 
believe in credit and tried to buy a car with cash (roughly $40K). Not 
only was he unable to buy the car, but he was investigated by 
authorities, who suspected he was a drug dealer (he wasn't).

Call me paranoid, but I think the government has enough info about me and 
my purchasing habits without its tracking my cash purchases too.

Now for the rave-related part,

Does anyone know how to reach Greg, late of Japan, brother to Bill (of 
Bill and Gabby)? I forgot to get a phone number last week at Sunset.

Also, do any of you sfrave oldtimers know where I can get a copy of the 
sharp/flat tape? It is one of a set of four tapes put together by Bob 
Ramsted from an sfraves event in 1993 (?). I loaned my copy out and never 
saw it again.

Thanks for any help.

Peace,
Kathryn

it was a mediocre Sunset 

the crowd seemed younger than usual.  either it
was or there was a lack of older folks.  this results
in a nice parade of cute, oh, nevermind ...  it makes a party
more one-dimensional.  i'd like to see a special Grandma Sunset
where everyone brings their oldest family or friends

the vibe was borderline 'burnt out' and
dancing was a bit incoherent.  the 'pigpen' style
dust was fun the first time.  usually i like super 
housey house, but that park begged for something
a little dirtier.

of course, this is all relative - 
galen's birthday party had me tapping my toes all week.

and it's official - "wading" is the hip new sport of the 90's.
i don't really get how it's scored but it sure is aesthetically
pleasing ...

Gee, I think it is pretty easy to figure out. You were looking at an ad from a 
promoter who wants to make money. And it is generally easier to get people
to go to an event if people think what they are doing is hip. And the wow 
quotient might actually be kinda high if what he had stated was true, which
obviously it is not(guess the Well came before DARPA/ARPA, sorry to all
those scientists that thought THEY created the Internet.) In the end it all
comes down to the bottom line, and in this case that line is money, no matter
what lies need to be told....

Not even a little looney - at least not by SFRaves standards :)

Interesting about Raves ... how many other people are into both
ambient/techno and gothic?  I'm just wondering, but I would assume it's
quite a few people.  I guess it is similar, in a sense - although I
couldn't see myself putting on Autechre in a candle lit room and thinking
a lot of black thoughts. Although I guess it would work in a _completely_
dark room thinking lots of weird thoughts.  In any case, I think the
feeling I get from rave music is a lot more of a feeling of timelessness
than anything else.  I think it is cathartic, as well, but not such a
violent, all-consuming catharsis.
	Guess it depends on the mood I'm in.

Hi All,
If you want to track what's happening in the US political arena as it
relates to the internet and technology you should get the Cyberwire
Dispatch.  Brock Meeks does an excellent job chronicling the antics
of our governing bodies.  He publishes maybe once every couple of weeks
(depends on Congress, etc.) so it isn't going to overflow your in box. 
Definitely worth reading.

To subscribe, send an email to:
    majordomo@cyberwerks.com

In the body of the email type:
    subscribe cwd-1 <your email address>

That should be it.

Enjoy,

Bradley

Hi.  My name is Sho.  I'm moving to the Bay Area in August
to work at General Magic.  Some of you know me from vrave.
...or if you've been out to the midwest, you may have heard
me spin ...or maybe you've seen my name on a flyer or two.
In any case, hi.

I'm currently trying to find housing.  It's not critical
that I find housmates who are in the scene, but I thought
that it might be nice to live with people who won't look at
me funny and ask questions like "what is that crap you're
listning to?  doesn't it have any words?"  Well, actually,
I'm not 100% sure if I want housemates at all!  But I guess
my feeling is that I'm a pretty social person and that it
would be nice to have people around.

So, if anyone out there is looking for another person to
live with starting in August, let me know.  I'm looking at
either palo alto or somewhere in/around SF proper.  

*crossing my fingers*

-Sho

Dear All;

	Kathryn has brought up a very good point. If we as a world & a
free society want to embrace this technology, which can & will change our
lives to a degree much greater than the TV, or may the automobile did.
Than the Internet must be protected by its own Bill of Rights. Keep in
mine I'm talking about a future where there's total world wide digital
connectivity to a much greater degree than at present, and a
computer/modem a standard piece of household furture, in almost every
home, sorta like Johnny Neumonic Technology, less the really unbelievable
stuff, A Right would be something like that no citzen can ever be 
totally locked out, restricted yes, but never totally locked out. Again 
I'm talking about a society where the most basic of necessities are 
access through the internet, regular mail, banking, public utillites ...etc

	Many of the people in power will be relucted to give americans 
more rights, in fact many feel we have to many. If this comes to be, as I 
think it will, there will come a time; like NOW, to start addvocating for 
the rights, electing politians that agree with them; and going out and 
protesting if necessary. THe groundwork laid over the next 20 years will 
impack into the furture, mainly our children, and their children.

	Sounds like an ATT commerical huh, but I believe it to be true. 
Sitting here as an engineer, I just see it coming, plane as day. No one 
own's the internet, yet, so the way I look at it it's public property, no 
negatives implied. So we the users the public own it, meaning that the 
internet is very provider, every accout ...etc from the main frames, & phone 
lines to the most modest of dumb terminals. The future is my 
responsibilty, I hope you think so to.

	Kathryn, I also image that as time goes on, this debate will grow 
to possibily rivaling that abortion, and will devide many a kind people. 
How much of this new techology to we want in our lives, in our homes?, are 
there sufficent checks & balances, is there a guarentee of privacy, or at 
least a reasonable assurance? why not just keep going on the way we 
are(not). Tuff questions?

	Please post all flames privatly, thank you, and remember its just
my opinion :), I not sitting here writing legaslation, save that for Bill 
& Newt.

...and straight-edge, and Riot Grrrl ((although those are more cultural/ 
fashion movements than a musical genre)) and ska... for now.

Remember, corporate media exists by exploiting existing forms of youth 
culture and repacking them for mass consumption. One of the reasons being 
that if left with only their own creativity to work with the best that they 
can come up with is Full House and David Hasselhoff. It's so much easier 
to find something that already works on an underground ((less-overground ?)) 
level and rip that off. When flannel and Doc's stop selling, wallet 
chains, Vans, and LeBrets will be found in the "in" section of Rolling 
Stone's 1996 fashion tips ...if they aren't already. 

But when all's said and done, and Arron Spelling is ambulance chasing after 
the next big thing, all the people who invested time and work into their 
respective projects should still be there...in one form or another. 
They are one of the basic reasons why it works in the first place. 

I just stole that sermon from Eddie Blunt.

Hey, lay off David Hasselhoff!  He is one of the godfathers of house 
music.  Check out his 12" from 1988, the Knight Rider Acid Mix being a 
favorite.

hey all!

Was wondering if anyone knows anything about the Rainbow Gathering and
related raves in Taos, New Mexico the week of July 4th. Fraser posted
something about it a while back but gave no details and hasn't responded to
my requests for info. I've already looked on MTN Raves on the WWW but
couldn't find anything about it. We'll be in Santa Fe the whole week and
would love to check out the scene in Albuquerque & Taos. Any info would be
greatly appreciated. How 'bout you Tristan... know anything about it?? 

Love Lydia & Stephan

Yet another raving weekend
==========================

After the Full moon rave Monday night,   and the Solstice on Wednesday,
I felt like I really needed to get out again,   so according to the SFR
calendar....

   Friday, June 23rd - Frequency 8 - from the Forest to the Fields
   A CyberTrance Journey with Cyr, MysterE and MARS. $2 donation
   requested. Map Point open from 11:30 to 1:30. 415.541.5019

This entry,  from the trusty SFR calendar attracted me because it was
outside,  and DJ Mars was spinning.   Mars plays some really good
trance,  and when I first heard him at Atomica,  he was playing even
harder trance.   Although,  when I returned from Oz,   I notice he has
slowed down by quite a few BPM's.   Some of his music selections are
played in the Australian scene,  are very melodic,  and incredibly
trancy.

Another factor that really made me select this one,  was that it was
outside,  and in Marin county,  where I live.

I call the info line,  and discover it to be very close to Stinson
Beach,  and with a heat wave coming on,   I wanted to be as close to the
Pacific Ocean as I can get,  so I figured this would be a good one.

The Map point had a rather narrow window,   so I waited as long as
possible or my friend Craig to return,  but left without him.   I arrive
at 1:30 am,  just as the map point was about to close.   The trail was
pointed out,   so down I went,  onto this isolated beach,   where I
heard this really good trance music.   I wandered around,   checking out
the area,   but not that many people were there,   but the vibe was
really great.

I estimated about 30 - 40 ppl showed up,  possibly more...  and it
wasn't long before I headed out to the dance area.   Dancing on sand
really wasn't that bad,   once I found the right spot near the speakers.

Mars eventually went on,  and literally spin my brains around in my
head.   Although the energy was low,   IE: slower than his normal BPM's,
Mars played a wonderful set,   except when he played Mr. Tambourine Man
by the Byrds.   I couldn't believe he would stick in such an "Out of
place" song,  but I headed for my blanket,   hoping that the music would
change.    Radion,  another friend with me,  came up and said "Lets go,
I'm really getting bored".   I said,  "lets wait and see what happens".
I keep trying to remember to ask Mars why he played it.

Eventually, the music changed,  and some more brain twisting beats
filled the still air.   It was unusually warm for being on the coast,
which is usually cold and foggy in the summer.

The air was amazingly clear,  and the star light was reflecting on the
ocean,  really made for some awesome visuals.

Although,  not that many people showed up,  this party was really great.
They had good trance,  a really good environment,  and it went on until
about 6:30 am,   well after daylight.

The surprising thing was how they got the generator and sound system
down the steep and rather treacherous hills,   but was well worth it for
a bust-free party.

After the party,  Radion and I went to Bolinas.   For those not familiar
with the area,   Bolinas's claim to fame is it's obscurity.   Those
living there have removed all signs pointing to Bolinas.   Its a small
beach town in Marin,  but with really hip people.   We arrive at 7 am,
and nothing was open,   except a lone worker in a restaurant who sold me
a cup of coffee.

We meet these really strange hippie types and get the lo-down on the
happenings in the area.   Then this truck pulls up and this lady gets
out,  and goes into the restaurant.   She immediately rushes out,
complaining she was assaulted when the worker kicked her out.   She was
in a really bad mood,  but apparently she knows everyone in town.

Radion and I decide to walk around the town via the beach,  and the
morning was incredibly warm and nice.   We made it back to the
restaurant for my traditional pancakes,   then head back down the hiway
through Muir Woods.   Ahhh!!  Just what I need,  a trek through Muir
woods to balance my body.    But as luck would have it,  the Double
Dipsea running race was coming through.   For those out of towners,  the
Dipsea is a run from Mill Valley to Stinson beach.   The Double Dipsea
was a run from Stinson to Mill Valley and BACK.   This is about 18 miles
through rugged hills and valleys,  over logs,  and under branches.
Also,  were the tour busses,   but I managed to find an isolated spot
devoid of people,  where I could stick my feet in the stream and
meditate.   WOW!!  It was really getting hot,  even down in Muir woods.

After about 45 minutes with nature,   I decided to head back to the car,
where Radion was sound asleep and headed back to Mill Valley.   When I
arrived it was blistering hot.   I headed down to the town square to
hang out with the locals,  until I got an idea.   I said "Anyone want to
go to "Three wells".    Everyone around me said YES!!!  lets go..  3
wells is a local secret spot where a water falls down in 3 small,  but
rather deep pools of very cold water.   It is a place where one goes to
get relief from the sizzling heat of a heat wave.   So,  all day
Saturday,   I did my best to stay cool.

That evening,   there were these parties scheduled...

   Saturday, June 24th - Kundalini
   DJs Markie Mark, Garth, Travis, Galen, Tony, Carlos. 415.337.4337
   510.944.7743

   Saturday, June 24th - Funky People Presents: e-Quality
   DJs Rick Preston, Dave Alga, Ryan Tapia and guests. Lasers by Kevin.
   1st 100 people get free cassettes. 408.993.3861 415.773.8916

   Saturday, June 24th - Organic: Tribute
   DJs Cesar (LA), Simon, Emma (DIY), Graeme, Jay-J, Mark Farina. In the
   dub attic: Professor Smith. 9pm-6am, $7, 520 4th St @ Bryant.
   415.266.8215

   Saturday, June 24th- Cyber-Safari Earth Cruise
   -Parallel University Virtual Command Center at Fort Mason
   -Megatripolis Cyber-Safari Party at Big Heart City (836 Mission)
   w/DJs Ethan, Mars, Theta Blip, Cyr and Alex. $8. See web page or call
   415.LAB.2323 for more info.

So,  I decided to go for Megatripolus Cyber-safari,  despite Kundalini's
recent popularity.   Mars Was spinning again,  so I could get more
trance,  and WOW!!  it was wonderful.  The attendance wasn't really that
good,   but the dancing room I had,  more than made up for it.   The
vibe was really good,  and the space (Big Heart City) was really great.

It was scheduled to go until 6 am but the owners decided to pull the
plug at 3 am.   They wouldn't even let the last song play to completion,
and it was one of the best songs Mars was playing.

After it was over,  I took Craig somewhere,  and headed over to Organic.
Organic was at the Troc,  a club famous for turning off the air
conditioner so they could sell more drinks.   It must have been 110
degrees in there,  as I was soaking wet just walking across the dance
floor to the chill area that was even hotter.   People were sitting on
the floor,  soaking wet,  fanning themselves.   About the coolest place
was the front entrance where the door would occasionally open,  letting
in some cool air.   I tried to dance,   but after an evening of good
acid trance,   I didn't enjoy it that much.  Graham was spinning house,
but I at least made an appearance,  saying hi to yet more people who
discovered I was back.

Also,  they were filming this for an MTV show to air sometime in Aug.
It focuses on Herbal Ecstasy and tries very hard to persuade people not
to take drugs.    Oooh!  What a false front they built.   Anyway,  the
Troc was decorated up in really funkey stuff,  all stuck on the walls.
Anyway,   the filming had stopped by the time I arrived (About 3:45 am).
I didn't stay long,   but met a lot of old friends I haven't seen since
I got back.   I left and hung out in SF until later,   then headed back
to 3 wells to sit under the waterfall to cool off.   The heat was very
oppressive,  and the waterfall really felt GREAT!!

Suddenly I realize that Sunset was on,  so I head home to record the
info line,  and learn of it's location and head out there.

It wasn't long before I found it,  and immediately set down my blanket
and started to dance.   As usual,  the very blissful music put me into a
wonderful trance state..  About 2 hours later,   I decide to check out
the area and walk around.   WOW!!  more people than I thought...   Lots
more!!   or in AusSpeak "Heaps more".   Anyway,  despite not sleeping
since Thursday evening,  I danced just about all the time.   It really
wasn't possible to just sit around,   so I kept my schmooze time really
down,  and even schmoosed while dancing.   Met a few more new SFRavers.

9 am finally rolled around,  and the signal for the last tune was given,
so I drop a friend back to SF,  and head for home with a big smile on my
face...   WOW!!   4 raves without sleep....  Yup!!  Summer is here...

Have you folks tried reading the alt.gathering.rainbow newsgroup? I'm not
a subscriber myself , but I'm sure there's information you want there!

 If you're in New Mexico , have some sopapillas for me! A great , simple
fluffy fried bread ; eaten by biting off a corner and pouring honey into
it before devouring the whole!

150 - 200 of us held hands in a large circle as Galen finished his
set on the longest day of the year.  30 yards away another train
rumbles by and we all cheer.  A few people start dancing in the center
of the circle and then we all charge in, flailing our arms, jumping up &
down, hugging, laughing.  Jason moves the music into the ambient realm and
after a few minutes we start to calm down to sit on the grass dance area.
We move to create a circular clearing and Claire places a firestick at its 
center.  

The Light Family Movement Solstice event was coming to a close.  I whisper
to my companion next to me, "I guess this is the ritual part." I wondered
what kind of slant would be imposed upon us.  A sermon, chants?  Would I have
to play audience to a drumming circle? (I had left my percussion implements 
in the car.)  For me, the rave itself, i.e. the communal dancing, *is* the
ritual.  What more do we need?

We waited to the choral strains of a familiar Global Communications tune.
The stars were coming out.  Most people were silent.  There were a few hoots
and minor displays of personal expression - not everyone was able to fully
let go of their self-focus for this special moment.  But most of us did.

After about 10 minutes, I realized that this *was* a special moment.  There 
was a message here for us that often gets lost on the midst of the party.
We were reflecting, meditating as a group, in simple reverence to our being 
together.  Nothing needed to be said; no symbols, no togas or naked blue
fire dancers.  We were all equal in acknowledging that there was something
important, even serious, about how strangers can come together as one and
feel fundamentally connected to each other.

Someone started playing a digeridoo, and then it was over.  We left the park
passing the three police vans that had just arrived to enforce the peace.

Typical!  In this society where every single second of every single day 
we are being told how to think, what to do, how to act, what rights we 
are allowed to have and which one's we are not.  And just when it looks 
like we, as a race, are going to be consumed by the evils of Western 
democracy along comes modern technology to save the day.  It created the 
internet, the internet is probably the only place in the world where 
there is true anarchy; where no-one tells one what to think or what not to 
do.  If used correctly, the internet could be responsable, and the 
catalyst for, revoloution.  It is truely one of the freeist thing's on 
this fair planet.  This might sound a bit romantic and nieve (so what?) 
but I really do truely believe this.
and this is why I got so depressed at reading Darknesses mail about the 
need for an internet bill of rights.  All a Bill of Rights does is say to 
the people under it: "yes, we will let you do this, and maybe that, but 
deffinatly not that."  It does not give us greater freedoms it merely 
serves to lull us into a false sense of secrurity so that the powers that 
be can carry on deceiving and lying to us.  Personally, I think that I 
am intelligent enough to be able to decide what I can and and what I can 
not with out a set of rules, or a bunch of men, telling me what to and 
how to think. Remember, the terms regulation suppression are exactly the 
same.
In short, the internet is true anarchy.  We can say anything and there is 
nobody to tell us otherwise.  If we had a bill of rights their is a 
danger that we would loose this.  What are you so scared of Brain?

I like Tristan's statement and agree w/ the sentiment. IMHO, there's no
need for an internet bill of rights because it should be 100% covered
by existing protections provided by the constitution and in particular
"freedom of speech." Any "special" internet bills will just be a way to
slowly regulate it, shut it down, and make it less easy to use for acts
of FREEDOM and SEDITION against oppressive governments. 

The reason why the gummint is running scared is precisely because the
internet, personal publishing, easy and potentially anonymous/secure
communications all allow us to maintain better vigil over our freedoms
and rights, which is  something which the US founding fathers sought
when they formed the US gummint. This of course runs contrary to the
actual practices of our government -- decisions being made behind
closed doors, with "national security" used as a front and a cover
story. That and lobbying/rulemaking done by a clique of moneyed,
well-connected insiders (political action commities, for example) that
attempt to shove laws through before the public finds out what is going
on. The internet cuts through all the guff, at least for the people
vigilant enough, and literate enough to know how to read. However, this
tool will only work for people that care, and are smart enough to
engage their critical abilities, or at least not to be swayed by
Goebbels-like emotion-rich/fact-starved oratory (e.g. Rush Limbaugh).
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, a terminal/modem, and
$17.50/month to your internet provider.

One can say the same thing about the internet that Arlo Guthrie said
about his guitar: "THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS!" Lets open the floodgates
to all and *DISCUSS*, or *DEBATE*, or whatever. Make FLAMES not BOMBs!

However, I do have one nit to pick (as usual) w/ tristan's post:

Actually, it's not just a bunch of men. Can you say Dianne Feinstein, 
Ms.-internet-censorship-because-there's-crazy-internet-anarchists-out-there-
telling-people-how-to-build bombs? That and "we're doing it for the
children..." What a load of hooey.

D.F. is one person who I'll never vote for again... please consider her
recent record on these sorts of things the next time an election comes
up.

        Word! I think, though that one of the things that the 'rave' scene
has going for it is it's realization that it's not in the 'business' (i
know, i know, bad choice of words) in making something 'original' nor
'subversive' as punk was trying to do (that is, punk was making points
about originality being a sham, that anyone could do it, etc) and, if one
follows what the situationists have written about advanced capitalism,
commodity exchange and 'recuperation' [which was their term for the
capturing, repackaging a re-selling of 'rebellious' counter-culture
movements, ie: grunge wear (tm) (i've seen this, seriously!)].  Anyways,
that wasn't really a sentance but what i'm trying to say is that the only
way (according to the situationists in the 60's) that one could escape
recuperation was through detournement (roughly translated as: mischeivious
detour) which is taking ALREADY recuperated signs (such as corporate logos,
corporate music, etc) and recontextualizing them to serve an ironic
purpose, Negativland is a perfect example of this, as are those oldskool
"united colours of tripping" or "high" (instead of Tide) shirts...
        i think that the thing that enables 'rave' culture not to be
'recuperated' is that it's pretty amorphous, and it doesn't really have any
sort of agenda as other movements have had.  We're not really fighting
'against' anything, we just want to dance ;) and if we overthrow the ruling
order in the process then that's cool too ;)
        peace,

CyberWire Dispatch // Copyright (c) 1995 //


Jacking in from the "Damn the Torpedoes" Port:

Washington, DC -- A posse of top House Republicans are riding into
Cyberspace wearing White Hats and riding a horse called the First
Amendment.  

Rep. Chris Cox (R-Calif.), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, is
readying a bill that would prohibit the government from placing any
regulations on content in Cyberspace.  According to a draft of the bill
obtained by Dispatch, even the guerilla war on the First Amendment now
being waged in Statehouses throughout the nation would be thwarted.  Cox's
bill, which he plans to co-sponsor with Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) would
preempt state laws that now restrict content. 

Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has gone into full-scale
"Marshall Dillon" mode, assailing attempts by the Senate to curb
pornography on the Internet by means of the Exon/Coats amendment, which
passed as part of the Senate's telecommunications reform package.  
Gingrich, speaking Tuesday night (July 20) on his weekly "Progress Report"
cable program, said the Exon/Coats amendment was "very badly thought-out."

Civil libertarian groups have already blasted the Exon/Coats amendment,
calling it unconstitutional along several points.  The Electronic Frontier
Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology have issued detailed
section summaries of the bill.  Both rip into the amendment along legal
lines, carving out its huge constitutional flaws with the force of a chain
saw.

Gringrich, not short on candor himself, minced no words denouncing the the
Exon/Coats provision, calling it "a violation of free speech."  He said the
move by Exon would have "no real impact" and was merely a political ploy,
which would give all 84 Senators that supported the amendment "a good press
release back home."

Rep. Cox said government should "stay out" of trying to regulate the
electronic arena.  Instead, he favors industry solutions and guidelines.  
He said the Exon/Coats amendment, combined with the recent court case that
hammered Prodigy in a libel case, sends the message that online services
shouldn't even try to deal with objectionable material.  "What service is
going to want to risk trying to police [content] on their system?"  Cox
said, "if all they get in return is a lawsuit?"  

Cox is even opposed to the government mandating some kind of blocking or
filtering technology.  He wants a hands-off approach for fear that
government intrusion would only "act as a drag on progress."

Gingrich accused the Senate of punting on a "serious issue which is how do
you maintain right of free speech for adults while also protecting children
in a medium which is available to both."  His comments are ironic:  
During
the Senate debate on the telecom reform bill, Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.) 
said
that a proposed substitute amendment to his bill, offered by Sen. 
Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.), was "nothing more than a punt."  Leahy's amendment would
have called on the Justice Department to first study the problem of
objectionable material on the Internet before rushing in with any
legislation.

The House is due to began debate on its own version of 
telecommunications
reform within the next few weeks.  The House bill has a version of the
Leahy amendment already in place.  There is currently no one offering 
an
Exon/Coats clone amendment.  But someone is almost certain to bring it 
up,
House congressional staffers say.  

What happens if the Cox-Gingrich posse runs into the Exon/Coats crowd?  
"As
Chairman of the Republication Policy Committee, I would vigorously 
fight
that," Cox said, setting the stage for the Cyberspace equivalent of the
shoot-out at the OK Corral.

Meeks out...

Hey everyone.

I was just hanging out thinking about MTV filming at Organic. I was

here. Personally it kinda scares me. Its hard for me to articulate it right

I know its off the subject a little but some things just need to be said.
Last night a couple of very beutiful ravers as well as my wife went to a
protest for Mumiam Abu Jamal who is schedualed to be executed in August. At
the protest a couple of people lit a dumpster on fire but that was the
extent of the disruption what followed was obcene to say the least.  The
police followed the protesters and then barred their exit. and started
beating people as well as arresting people.  My wife told me she was
watching the woman in front of her getting beaten by the cops and she
thought she was next. Luckily someone dragged her into a lawyers house just
to the side. The cops tried to follow and arrest the people in the house
but the owner/lawyer shouted out that the cops could not come in. So she
waited four hours as all of the deomonstraters were arrested and quite a
few were beaten. She saw someone with a video camera have it taken out of
their hand and smashed by a cop, then the cop beath the protester and
dragged him away. Police brutality is real. Those cops terrified and
arrested 300 people like it or not. It happened. I held my wife in my arms
as she wept with fear and frustration. ALso the papers made it look like
the protesters were violent and looking for trouble, but my wife told me
that before the cops tore into the crowd they had been chanting "peace,
police, peace". It did not stop them. This relates to raves because if
raves become big enough to be perceived as a threat the same thing will
happen to ravers that happened last night to the demonstrators. So I would
suggest that people educate themselves about the police.

LOVE,
GABE

PS-They is a protest tonight in the city to demand the realese of the
protesters at something called the epicenter in the city. Also you can call
the SF DA at (415) 553-1752 and tell them to release the prisoners.

No doubt you mean Epicenter records at 475 Valencia (corner of 16th,
upstairs).  10 punk points to any who know where I mean.

Hi Everyone,
I am wondering how the rest of you feel about BSPs (blatant self promotions
a.k.a advertisements)?  Why do I ask?  It seems recently there have been a 
few BSPs sent to sfraves that are, well, excessive.  I am not against BSPs,
in general, because they usually have information that interests me.  But, 
it would be nice if people posting BSPs could maybe do the following:

    1)  Identify it as a BSP in the subject line - That way people 
        who don't like BSPs can just delete them.  An example might
        look like:
        	Subject:  BSP - It's My Party...

    2)  Make them short and sweet - Use only 4 maybe 5 lines max to
        tell use what you're doing, why you're doing it, where you
        are doing it, what DJs are playing, etc.

    3)  Tell us how to get more information - Include an email address 
        or web page address where we can obtain all the details *if*
	we are interested.

Maybe something like this is already the policy on this mailing list.  If
so, please pardon the use of the bandwidth.  Otherwise, can we come to some
agreement about what is appropriate and what is not?  In this way, we might
be able to avoid some ruffled feathers in the future.

Thanks,

Bradley

hello all. i would like to point out that there is (or at least so i am
told) that there is an on-going demonstration at the San Francisco County
Jail. If anyone from berkeley is going, gimme a call at 510.664.2696 ...
would prefer to go with others :)

also, this message said there is something happening sometime at Epicenter
but i haven't heard about anyone going there.
Epicenter (book and info shop) is at 475 Valencia Street in sanFran
phone 415.431.2725

if there are more arrests, please remember that within 3 hours of your
arrest, you can make 3 free local calls to lawyer, reletive/friend, and
bondsman. 

more info will be posted to the peclist (macjordomo@lib50b3.lbl.gov) i'm sure

take care and see you soon.

4 words:

I       DON'T       LIKE      IT!!!!!!!!


It'll be like what happened in Reality Bites: Remember how  Winona made a 
film and her yuppie boyfriend who worked for an MTVish type of place had 
it made to fit that image - which totally distorted what Winona's 
oringional piece said and overall feeling of it?  I can totally parallel 
that scene in the movie with what is going on here.  IMO, of course.

Namaste sfraves!

    After an incredible and beautifully intense year in India and 
Nepal, here I am, back home, back in the old U.S. of A, and back on the 
net.  Hopefully some of you still remember me, I was a member of sfraves for 
about 2 years, and had the privelege of playing at the very first Friends 
and Family and hosting another sfraves party at my apartment in Berkeley.
I spent far too much money on records in London on my way home, so I'm 
ready to jump back into the expensive hobby of "wannabe" dj.  I should 
soon be back on KALX 90.7fm Berkeley, teaming up with dj Minor to help 
this station become a kinder and gentler place for electronic music.  
Stay tuned for details...
     By the way, I was able to experience the Goa rave scene for X-mas 
and New Year's, and if I get motivated, I'll post a descriptive account- 
basically, it was disappointing music-wise (high nrg techno on DAT only), 
but you gotta love being on a tropical beach on the southwest coast of 
India surrounded by thousands of drugged and displaced Europeans.  Let me 
just say it was interesting...
     If anyone else has been to Goa in the past, I'd love to hear about 
your experiences (has Goa ever been mentioned on this list?).  Drop me a 
line...

Acid always,
Seth

Just got back from the new moon party.  If your thinking of going, you 
might want to wait a while and listen to the recording to see if its 
being relocated.
As I was still in the parking lot, a cop car pulled up with his spot 
light on us.  Asked if there was a party, and warned us about how 
dangerous it is there.  Said people get shot all the time, and as a 
matter of fact he got shot there last year.
We told him we were just going to hang out with some friends.  As we were 
standing there a couple more cop cars came.  The cop told us to go home, 
and that they were going to drive in and break up whatever was going on.
Hung around for a short while watching the cop cars drive around in the 
distance trying to find the party.  When I heard the bull horn and 
spotted another cop car entering the parking lot, I felt it was time to 
leave.
I guess its still possible they might have talked the cops into letting 
the party continue.  Oh well, guess I'll just wait til organic in the 
park to shake it up a bit.

I agree, the Frequency 8 folks put on an AWESOME outdoor.

I'm am suitably impressed with the amount of heavy shit they dragged into
the forest a few weeks ago and onto the Red Rock beach last friday night.
Turntables, 4 speaker stacks, generator, lights, amps, etc.  Some of those
pieces take two people to manuever and its a narrow trail.

We aren't talking about any ordinary renegade here!!!

And the TRANCE, if you are a trance junkie like I am, is extremely fresh.
Frequence 8 is the bay area distributer for some german label, so at least I
know where I'm going to buy all my CD's from.  MARS made the point of saying
that it wasn't just any old trance, it was cosmic trance.  It's more melodic
and complex than Goan trance for example (though I like Goan).

The Red Rock sight was a dangerous walk EVEN WITH A FLASHLIGHT. Unlike the
forest rave, there was no full moon to illuminate the steep and windy trail.
IF YOU ARE A SERIOUS RAVER, ADD A PENLIGHT TO YOUR ESSENTIAL EQUIPAGE.  It's
stupid not to have a 'light.

Fortunately, no one fell to their deaths.  It certainly helped that the
stars were as thick as milk that night.  I hadn't seen stars that beautilful
since the new moon at goat rock, or maybe Burning Man '94.

Well,  it sure didn't last very long.   Shortly after we arrived,  it got
busted... Wonder how they found out?

I seem to remember this sort of thing happening in 1992-93 as well - I think 
a couple parties were filmed for news shows, a documentary on LSD, 
maybe something on those crazy ravin' kids. Does anyone else recall this too?
My sense is that most party attendees pretty much ignored the media 
types, and pretty soon they went away (after filing fairly shallow and 
sensationalistic stories). I don't think there was much lingering effect 
on the scene, but then it wasn't the glorious MTV either...

Peace, and smile for the cameras :)

Hi all, 
 
I'm heading down south this weekend to spend a few days in LA and San Diego. 
I was wondering if, per chance, anyone might know of any parties taking place 
in either city this weekend? 
 
Thanks much,

There is a semi-constant security force out there around the main 
building on the hill. They probably immediately spotted something out of 
the ordinary (ie. more people than usual for this time of the night, 
walking in the shadows, *trying* to look inconscpicuous) and alerted the 
local police. I don't think we need to look much further.

I think you are absolutely correct. I like to know when, who, and where I can
get more info, a format which virtually everyone I have seen post here has
adhered to, with one notable exception that I can think of.

Two and three page BSP's followed by glowing reviews forwarded from other
places by members of the production company amount to little more than 
electronic masturbation.

re: MTV at Organic

hmm...how about a big banner or something saying "Corporate TV Still 
Sucks" or something?  maybe i'll do that if i go... (not that it would 
get on MTV, unless thay wanted to be all self-consciously "cool" or 
something, but it would still be a nice response.)

yeah, i feel uncomfortable with MTV filming at raves here, too, since i 
like to keep the parts of the rave scene i participate in as 
anti-commercial as possible, and i don't feel like being mtv's flavor of 
the month... but of course, i can't prevent mtv from being at other 
promoter's parties... oh well...

take care,
monicat

I've been in New York for a week.The only nice people I found were the 
people at Liquid Sky. I gave them a 13 moon calander pamphlet and of all 
the many people I gave 13 moon stuff to they were the only ones who didn't 
make me nervous. Yeah ravers! 

MTV came to Ameba and they talked to Mark but he scared them and they 
left and never came back! Yeah Mark!

Yea!  I always get the impression that the quality of the rave is inversly
preportional to the size of the flyer.

I just noticed an ad on the back page of the Bay Guardian that 
offered "MTV Sucks" t-shirts for $10...

If everyone wore those t-shirts then they would probably not be too 
keen on filming us :)

Let me see if I have got this straight.  MTV are going to be filming at 
the Organic rave?  I wonder if Diasy Ferris (or what ever her name is, 
all those bimbos look alike to me) is going to be their and if some one 
would be good enough to spike her drink with LSD because she deffinatly 
needs to lighten up!
No wonder Organic got a permit so easily for this 
party.  And so, I take it, that people feel weired about MTV being their 
because they feel that it will be the beging of the end for rave music in 
just the same way that MTV brought about the beginging of the end of 
great soul/funk music.  Well you are absoloutly right.  And yes, we 
should all be wearing "MTV" sucks shirts.  But if it means that hard 
working people who are dedicated to the cause such as Mark and Tracy (to 
mane but a few) get the publicity and recognition they deserve because of 
it then I am all in favour of  it.
We do not need MTV.  All they understand is monery And comercialism and 
these have no place in rave culture.  But a lot of young people watch MTV 
and my motto has alwyas been start them young.  If by MTV filming the 
rave a bunch of people think "wow that's looks fun, I'd to to go to one 
of those rave thing's" then this is all well and good.  Remember: MTV has 
not ruined popular music but the money ascoiated with them, together with 
the ignorance of the average MTV viewer have.  People should make up 
their own minds and maybe them seeing it on TV may, I repeat may, act as 
a catalyst.  Having said that, however, it is probably just wishful 
thinking on my part.  Still, if it means that their is a chance of me 
chatting up that Daisy what-ever-her-name-is bird I'm all in favour of it.

See ya!
Tristan.

        Reply to:   RE>San Diego raves.

John ..
When you're in San Diego, call the Static Line @ 619.685.8449, they usually mention all the cool underground things that are happening.  Also, stop by the San Diego (original) branch of Behind The Post Office which is downtown at the corner of  8th and G, they usually have tons of fliers.  Be sure to ask for a copy of the free "Mappy" map which they just put out with Bill from Oricom Technologies.  It lists every cool record and clothing store, cheap hipster restaraunt, etc, in downtown San Diego (there's more than you would think).
A couple of more things, after hours (2AM on) on Saturday night there's a pretty cool club called Romper Room which is at the corner of Sixth and Market.  It's always a lot of fun but it seems to be a little more happening on the alternating weeks when Mark E. Quark is DJing.  He's one of the best djs I've ever heard.  There's also a free thing in the park every Sunday afternoon that's lots of fun.
I used to throw underground parties in San Diego a long time ago so if you need any more info about anything, give me a call @ 415.626.6223.

Hi all, 
 
I'm heading down south this weekend to spend a few days in LA and San Diego. 
I was wondering if, per chance, anyone might know of any parties taking place 
in either city this weekend? 
 
Thanks much,

IS THE WORLD COMING TO AN END?!?!?

For once I find myself in almost total agreeance with you Tristan.

The only thing I doubt is that MTV's piece would be in any way related
to reality, seeing how MTV likes to put a spin on their so-called "news", and
would probably do all the wonderful people in the scene much more of a 
disservice than a service. 

Anyone know a store where you can purchase a MTV SUCKS T-shirt? I would 
definitely buy one and wear it tomorrow. 

Boo MTV.... Yea chatting up Daisy.... >:)

I have mixed feelings about the mtv thing.  I definitely don't think it 
has to be a bad thing.  I don't think we have to send them bad get out of 
here vibes while they are there.
I think they will only ruin the scene if we as a group allow ourselves to 
buy into their interpetation of it, should it be different from our 
understanding of it that makes it so special to us all.
The energy we have as a group can remain to be the shared joy that it 
is, if we continue to emphasize and share the vibe within ourselves and to 
each other. 
Yes, mtv can be a major distraction, like many other things are to the 
experience of the beautiful shared vibe.  Once we experience the vibe 
through our sharing, those distractions become secondary and can be part of 
the vibe.
I think listening to the incredible music, and sharing the feelings from 
the music will take me to a place where mtv won't be an annoying distraction.
With the help of the music, we can let our vibe continue in the future no 
matter what mtv does.  We always have the underground.

I agree, but then I also think we should be nice to cops when they come 
to check us out or even bust us.  Y'know, that silly PLUR thing.  Doesn't 
mean we should help them with their agenda. 

The Rave scene is already being exploited and commercialized - the Herbal E 
dealers come to mind as the most blatant.  Actually, MTV has been kinda slow 
in the rave exploitation department.  They probably haven't figured out how 
yet.  Ravers don't watch much TV.  MTV viewers who discover raves might
suddenly become bored with MTV.  But raves are too cool for MTV to dis.  What 
should MTV do?  I almost feel sorry for them.

Speaking of commercialism, we had a wonderful time at Freedom last year
despite it being a holiday weekend, permitted, aboveground, big, etc.
Just got the mailing; Galen & Doran have been added, Mark Farina
dropped.   They plan some kind of circle ceremony at sunset then music
from 9pm to 9am.  Also, and I quote:

"Organic food will be served all night, free water for the thirsty,
friends for the lonely,
ambientorganicjunglebuzzwordhybridinternetdemographicbandwagonbreakfast
for the hungry, what more could you ask for?"

That made me smile.  Martin parties have usually been good at straddling
the fence between big production commercialism and the vibey 
underground.  At the very least, we're gonna get Big Sound, Good DJs, 
and a legal outdoor location.  Janie & I hope to see you all there.

I think that wearing "MTV Sucks" t-shirts is knuckling under to the idea
of MTV as an all-powerful empire of taste, and gives them just as much
exposure as "MTV Rocks" shirts would.  Someone once said "There's no
such thing as negative publicity", and they're right.  Beavis and Butthead
show that MTV is not afraid to poke fun at itself, and unless EVERYONE at
the rave had one, they'll likely interview someone with the "Sucks" shirt,
quote them out of context, and make them look like an idiot.

The easiest way to guarantee non-exposure is to use lots of the Seven (or
eight, or whatever) words you can't use on TV.  The best way is to weird
them out so totally that they can't process you.  "Last time they set a
live goat on fire, and it was running around and bleating and shit, and
we tried to put it out with our smart drinks except they were all laced
with acid and it freaked out and bit me on the nipple.  Want to see the
scar?"

Or, just be honest.  The ultra-hip calculated cynicism of the MTV crowd
has a hard time dealing with love and unity without smirking.

And, my advice; some DONT'S.
1) DON'T talk about drugs.  If you're asked, say something like, "Well, 
that's why they have all the lights and posters and pretty stuff, so 
you don't have to take drugs to have a good time."  Or, "Television is
a drug, raving is an anti-drug."  Or, "Sure, but there are a lot more
fucked-up people in the average bar."  The last thing we need is a bunch
more naive kids trying to use raves as a place to score.

2) DON'T talk about locations used for underground stuff.  The Bonny Doon
disaster should teach us that lesson -- the scene will lose the location
permanently.

The more energy we spend fighting them, the more control they have over our
lives, just as if we were the mindless consumers we all deride.

Some stuff re: Organic and MTV -
1. As long as they don't interrupt the music to tell us
   "how to rave" for the cameras , I don't mind MTV filming us.

2. As long as the film crew and MTVites don't openly laugh
   at us , I don't mind (quiet chuckling is OK).

3. Cheap way to let my friends in other parts of the country
   know what I look like these days!

4. I will try to make it - I assume at the Golden Gate Park
   bandshell ? ( Gotta read that calender ...) . Anyway, I'll
   be wearing my black-and-yellow checked shirt with the
   portrait of Goofy on it - if you see me , come say hello!

5. Why pay some other capitalist bast*rd $$$ for an "MTV Sucks"
   t-shirt? That's meta-explotation!
    It'd be funny if MTV was actually the guys who were printing
   those "MTV Sucks" t-shirts!

Yes, MTV has been kind of slow in picking up on raves.  That's because they
are still exploiting the spring break party in florida with the bikini
clad babes and the frat boys scene still.  Ugh.  Once that gets boring they'll
be on to something new.  BTW, since MTV's Real World (what garbage) is moving
from SF to London, they may try to work in a rave angle.  It might be a good
way to test market the salability of raves without making a big investment in 
a special production.  Never know, huh!!! 

>> MTV viewers who discover raves might suddenly become bored with MTV.

Sheesh, I got bored with MTV when I found out they played the same videos
over and over and over and over and over again.  Maybe it took me 1.5 days
to realize that (not nonstop viewing!).  But some people like seeing repeats.
That's why they get away with it.

>> But raves are too cool for MTV to dis.

Rule #2: Never dis what you can make money from.  Raves are just on the
waiting list for MTV and general commercialization.  Actually it's already
here.  Look at nickelodean, they use techno as the background music for 
many of their own ad spots.  You can even find it on non-cable stations, 
too.  Someday the international house of pancakes will fire that bonehead 
they currently use in their commercials and instead they'll use hungry 
ravers groovin to techno.  :>)  What an icky thought.

>> What should MTV do?  I almost feel sorry for them.

Rule #3:  Never feel sorry for a company.  It doesn't feel sorry for you
so why should you feel sorry for a company.  Not to mention the fact that
companies don't have feelings.  :>)  Anyway, I could never feel sorry for
the people at MTV because of their programming.  Look at the trash they 
air like Beavis and Butthead.  MTV promotes senseless violence, destruction 
of property, and illwill between people.  If you have ever seen MTV
international, you'll know that it is even worse.  Between video sets they 
play these shorts that are always violent, usually misogynous, and most of 
all pointless.  Most insulting is that they try to mitigate the impact of 
this rubbish by doing trendy public affairs specials (such as teenage sex,
aids, etc.).

In spite of all this, there's no need to be mean or rude to the MTV crew that
comes around.  That's detrimental to the image we are trying to promote.  We
just need to be confident and strong in order to keep evolving the scene in
the direction we, as caring participants, choose.  This way, we'll keep it 
from being corrupted or exploited by MTV and the others.

Peace and Positivity,

Bradley

   Each year, the Fourth of July brings fireworks, nationalism and
   massive parties. The Gathering returns for the 4th annual Freedom
   party with a good lineup and a guaranteed crowd. Nation is dropping
   some big names as well - Sasha, CJ Mackintosh and the Masters at Work.
   For a lot less dough, check out the free Organic in the park on
   Saturday, Sunset on Sunday, and the Frequency 8 picnic at Stinson 
   Beach on Tuesday.   Finally, Come-Unity should be large again - 
   this time, please arrive _after_ me, so I don't have to wait in line
   behind you ;-)

Hehehehe.  You're absolutely right about that.  But, that is truly
characteristic of the music industry, don't you think.  What about those
bands in the late 50's and early 60's (even the Beatles) who released 
several songs that were almost exactly the same.  If it weren't for some
changes in the words, they would be identical!  How could that be, especially
at a time when there were so many new areas of music to explore (not that 
there still aren't) and competition wasn't as intense.  After all, there 
weren't 10 million different people trying to write the next #1 song like 
we have now?  

Actually, this phenomenon pervades all segments of the music industry.  I
begin to can't count the number of modern rock or hip hop songs that are
simply a repackaging of earlier works.  105.3 FM in SF is playing a song 
about underwear or something that sounds exactly the same as that song 
called Creep that was released a couple of years ago.  I was going crazy a 
year or so ago when there was a big trend to cover 60's and 70's songs. 
Everyone was doing it.  After a while it got very old and seemed as though 
there was a severe lack of creativity and profound amount laziness (make 
big money with the minimum possible investment).  Fortunately this all comes 
in cycles!  I must say, though, it made me appreciate the fresh little jewels 
hidden amongst the recycled material even more. 

Basically, except for isolated cases of real innovation, everything is a
variation on a theme.  That's why we have coke, diet coke, caffiene free
coke, and caffiene free diet coke.  Now you can have all of the above in
both cans and the old style bottles.  :>)

So far my experience at the hands of Sfravers has been pretty unpleasant.

 A bad taste is left in my throat by those members of this community that
have gone out of their way to tarbrush and ignore reality instead direcingt
fear and loathing towards myself. The merest step or mistep is greeted with
the rabid glee of vultures wanting nothing more than to discredit the
internationalist posse in the rave movement. How for example, do I explain
to this cynical mindset that in Africa the average number of telephone
calls made per year is TEN (10) and that merely having conversation over
the internet with people from this forgotten continent is a miracle. People
like Mr Adder are so jaded by their smug west coast connectivity that they
are neither impressed nor surprised when I and a team of committed ravers
pulled off an interactive video link to a Rave in Woodstock, Cape Town. And
then they have the gumption to describe the entire event as a  mere
promotion, a mere money grabbing example of greed. COME ON - I don't think
anyone would go without sleep for days (pandering to different time zones)
to establish this connection for MONEY,, there are easier ways to make cash
- like simply hiring a massive venue in Oakland like Cool World or Funky
Techno.

These efforts at connecting the world in the face of great odds, seem
wasted when all we have to offer the expectant masses in the Southern
Hemishere, are the likes of Mr Adder and his clan of proto-punk would be
gothic ravers dancing in the mire of a miserable America. What on earth has
bitten you so hard that you cannot dream of fun beyond the inevitalbe norm
of 2 by 4 raving?

I'm just trying to figure out what level of "mainstream" people here are
trying to come to terms with. MTV has been documenting raves for at least 5
years. This is an important point, since MTV has been in the scene longer
than most of the hardcore, because they've been around filming and
interviewing all the while. Whether it was at the crappy clubs or talking to
the right people is besides the point because it's all part of the house
music scene, albeit focusing on the mainsteam aspects. This is what they do.
The angst I sense around here has little to do with corporate forces
permeating the scene and a lot to do with the ideas that a party you percieve
as being underground actually isn't, and that anyone interviewed would
invariably misrepresent the scene. The facts are that these are the people
going to these parties, and this is exactly what MTV is after. Even more
disgusting are the suggestions of excluding MTV from an open (?) scene and
rules of what (and what not) to talk about to the cameras.

The house scene has been stalled for quite awhile now but y'all been having
too much fun to notice MTV catching up. The underground part moved on long
ago - you don't see cameras interviewing Jeff Mills or scooping around at the
gardening club, fr'instance.

hiya,
i'm from brisbane australia, and i'd like to follow up g's 
very clever suggestion with a few comments of my own.  (i subscribed to 
this list a few months ago).

there's nothing more effective than a very black sense of humour and your 
suggestion above is an excellent example.  furthermore, you can all sit 
around and have a good laugh about it afterwards.  if you take MTV's 
presence very seriously then you're building up their importance.  
another very effective way of dealing with an annoying presence is to 
simply ignore it.  imagine being asked for an interview or comment and 
saying that you've never heard of MTV.  it is possible!!! ;-) or you're not 
aware of who the MTV "personality" is.  keep 'em guessing with mysterious, 
intriguing and spacey comments.

recently, in australia, there's been a lot of protests/outrage about the 
french government commencing nuclear tests again near tahiti in the 
pacific ocean.  the one protest which i thought was the most memorable 
was carried out by an australian commedian, andrew denton.  he organized 
a huge truck full of horse manure to dump its contents outside of the 
french embassy.  creative subversion always makes me sooo happy.

celestial journeys,
kathleen

I believe that your unpleasant experiences are a direct result of your
actions and your statements:

No one has forced you to ally yourself with someone who claims to be the
"recognized authority" on the rave scene, and who believes that he
knows how the scene should be evolved.

No one has forced you to blithely ignore netiquette time and time again
with lengthly, off-sub postings to the point that you and Fraiser have been    threatened with censorship of your posts by BRIAN of all people, who 
rightfully loathes the concept or the burden of doing so.

No one has forced you to post multi-page BSP's, which contain fallacies
or outright lies in their content(since you all are obviously technically
savvy enough to pull off an ISDN link, then I find it difficult to believe
that those involved are unwittingly naieve enough to label the Well as
the birthplace of the Internet.)

No one has forced you to forward what are obviously biased, multi-page 
"reviews" of your gigs to this forum.

No one has forced you to respond to private e-mail in this public forum.

David, like it or not, we are not all out to get you. From day 1, I have 
NEVER seen you INTERACT with the flow of conversation, except in the thralls
of a flame war. What have we seen? Off-sub postings, BSP's, forwarded
"reviews," and copies of speeches. That is it. No more. When these are the 
ONLY posts that are seen, it becomes pretty obvious that you are using this 
mailing list as little more than free advertising and a political sounding 
board. You have desisted from the latter, for which I, and am sure others, are grateful. 

As far as being impressed by a link, I am not. Now here, I may be jaded, as
I work with computers and networks for a living. While the distances might
provide some difficulty, the formats and protocols are pretty much
standardized. 

In regards to Cool World at lest, I wouldn't go to one of their events
either.

Well, don't you think it a little presumptious to offer me to anyone?

As I have said before if America is so miserable, go back from whence
you came. Since I know America is not miserable(although there are many
unpleasantries,) I can only assume that it is you that are miserable. I 
suggest seeking happiness within yourself. Worked for me.

I finally got a photocopy of this poem that was handed out at the June 
18th Sunset.  In light of Independance Day coming up and Freedom (the 
rave) - the poem has even more significance right now.  I had 
several requests to post it and I'm happy to share the inspirational words.

namaste,
Amy

***************************************************************************************

This poem is dedicated to this summer - which is the summer of freedom.  
It is time to celebrate being free and what it really means.  The fact 
that we are all here means we are already a step ahead of society.  
Everyone celebrate and help spread the feeling of freedom.  This is only 
the beginning of this poem, add whatever you like.
love to you all...
Freedom is to dance wherever, whenever
Freedom is to looke someone in the eyes and smile
Freedom is to moan in pure ecstasy
Freedom is to shout full of bursting, bubbling energy
Freedom is hugs without expectations
Freedom is to cry at beauty
Freedom is to question reality
Freedom is to have tears streaming down your face whil walking alone
Freedom is to love and raise your hands in the air and sing that lovely 
song, hum that tune, scream or be silent
Freedom has no need to compete
Freedom is to be
Freedom is about respecting yourself

Mr Adder, we are neither amazed nor amused by your attempts to descredit.

Mr adder this is called free choice. I do not have a problem with your
choice of friends, or presume to choose them for you. Nor do I paint you
with another's karma.

For some reason you lump me and Fraser together - fuck you, I do believe
Brian threatened me, and only me, and that consensus reached was that since
EVERYONE ELSE WAS EQUALLY GUILTY of Posting, that his actions could be
considered a wee bit prejudicial even if within the standing orders of the
forum.

Fuck you yet again, Since I did not write this so-called "lie" but merely
pointed out that it was most certainly an easy mistake by Schwann in South
Africa. who can be easily forgiven since he is on the other side of the
world,
And I dispise the insinuation that we PLANNED this - It was a totally
personal response by Schwann, but then you probably watch MTV and cannot
tell the difference.

BTW We got the local telco in Cape Town to build us a digital exchange
specially for the occassion. MR Adder, you would be eaten for breakfast in
the third world. Get off your Perch and see that WE ARE NOT ALL JINGOISTIC
YANKEES nor care to be.

>No one has forced you to forward what are obviously biased, multi-page

But its okay for Crunch in Australia or every other Sfraver to do likewise.
and Why NOT you little creep.
YOu would'nt know what freedom of speech was if it was tattooed on your

Just goes to show what little you do know. There are at least 5 different
standards in the USA alone. and as far as ISDN goes, We got the FIRST EVER,
Group ISDN VIDEO CONFERENCE using  AN EXTERNAL site, FROM SF TO CT, ~South
Africa - and as mentioned had to install a digital exchange and a bridge
between the 64k and 56k standards amonst other amazing technical problems.
So FUCK your smugness amidst your lack of knowledge

and just to cover all bases: Bradley Graham rises to the attack with a

Could you please bend over and remove the wedge named CYNICAL from your behind.
Number-One if we wanted to jump on a bandwagon, why do it ten years after
the fact?
Number-Two one of the main reasons for doing the link to SA is that it has
a RAVE posse, alive and well.
Number- Three - After removing the death penalty and enshrining every
persons right to life in the constituion, SA is the free-ist nation on
Earth, unlike this country which has the HIGHEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE
INCARCERATED,             above Iran or IRAQ, is about to ban virtual sex
between consenting adults and  execute a BLACK JOURNALIST (mumia abu Jamal)
whose only crime is being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and
writing a story on the BLACK PANTHERS.
FRANkly  I am appalled.

 I might have been more interested and open to the idea
>if you linked up, say, India, Nepal, or Bhutan.

Yes, and if we had also linked up Mars and Venus and the Pyramid of Giza.
Fuck you, you burnt out cynical sloth. I am sure the Emporer Nero would not
have been interested either. YOu are jaded, jaded and even more jaded.


>Furthermore, it isn't clear how your event benefited the South African people,

First, why should it?
Second, It did - we launched a modems for SA schools campaign
Three, why the fuck do you hold me to standards that EVEN YOU CANNOT hope
to match?

Okay, lets turn this around  and ask you all - When last did a SF rave
benefit the American-Indian??

Do you have any soul, any soul, any soul or are you jaded, jaded, jaded.

And thats my rant for the day.

Fraser,
	I don'tr think anyone on this list fears or loaths you, in fact
I believe for the most part, they are not really concerned with you at all.
I think the problem is that you are way too concerned with your own media
image and whether people percieve you as "the international rave guru"
that's cool with me, MTV is nosing around and I'm sure they have a sound bite
(or is that sound byte :) just waiting for you.  We here in SF have a
tradition when it comes to getting the facts straight, and the simple fact is
that many people labored hard and long to bring the Internet as we know it
into reality, the Well had as much to do with this as you did. folks are
just correcting you that's all, once again your error was that you were so
busy focusing on YOUR event and YOUR promotion that you neglected to pass
your promos past someone who could have caught your error before you made
a misstep.  Yes we here on SFRAVES are _very_ sensitive to HYPE whether it
comes from within the community or from without.

All well and good, please bear in mind that before I was a raver I worked
for an organization called the Institute for Global Communications you
may have heard of one of our sister organizations in the UK called GreenNet.
The facts that you quote as far as I'm concerned are even more reason to
get the correct facts to people being exposed to the Internet for the first
time.  Actually South Africa has had an internet connection for at least 5
years but I think until the last year or two it was only 14.4.  IGC and its
associate organization The Association for Progressive Communications have
been working on wiring Africa for the last 10 years at least and it is a very
difficult job.  No one is discrediting the "internationalist posse" of the
rave movement, but maybe "one faction" of this posse forgets that there are
others who are silently working on several fronts as well.  Once again
you have drawn fire because of your sensationalism.

No Fraser I don't think you seek money, FAME is what you are after.

If you did these things than great, your actions should need no stroking
or hand applause, the people who's lives it touched know what you did and
how profound an action it was, don't worry about the nay sayers.  It's sort
of like House Music and parties in general, how do you express to someone
who has never been to a FMR, that feeling in the morning as the
sun is coming up at Bonnie Doon and you can see everyone's faces and you look
at eachother's eyes and everyone of you know a secret that is so precious 
and so dear but you can't  explain it to the person who has never been to a 
party they won't get it because it is pure experience, all you can do is lead
them to the party by way of your actions in life.

Fraser, If you are serious about linking the southern Hemisphere,
I can put you in contact with people who are very active on that front,
they can use all the help they can get.


	Lead by example.

The underground is still very much around and always will be even when
"rave" and Herbal E can be bought in Walgreens.  MTV is like Satan, They
don't ruin the scene they make deals with insiders who ruin it for them.
They appeal to your least common denominator, IMHO the best thing to do
is to ignore them.

 here's my 2 pesos:

I think (as I often do) that we as a community should not care wiether or not
to accept MTV to Organic....   I mean, if you ignore the cameras and people
stuffing microphones in yer face then what can they do.  It'll just look like
a normal festival or parade of sorts (i remember talking to someone @ sunset
saying that it felt like a big family picnic). I say just smile at your
family members (fellow ravers) and maybe wave at the camera once or twice.
 If anyone were to ask me about drugs, renegades ect al. Id just say that,
"hey in the 80's it was happening in the bronx, NY (remember Beat Street
eveyone) its just a new sound, a new generation".  And walk away...   


BTW Im really sorry about the New Moon party.  I was really hoping it would
take off but the police saw it differently (you know how violent us rowdy
ravers can be, shooting each other and all....)  =)
I was the one in black by the speaker....

LAter daze ,

For shame. 

This is not what I think our list is about. This is not what I think 
sfraves or raves in general are about. This is not what I think PLUR 
is about.

Please please take this attitude and your need to engage in a public pissing

Well, lemme fill you in...  Someone, call him person A, called person B a
"liar" for a post asserting that the Well invented the internet.  Person B
then flamed A back and then private flames were exchanged.  The list was
quiet until someone using A's account posted the private flames.  This is
the "blatant antagonism."

We have different styles and philosophies, but let's show a little
tolerance, please(hold the preaching and self-righteousness).  Some of us
see raves as a means to an end, others see it as an end in itself.  There is
no right or wrong.
That's how I see it anyways. 

I like to see people express themselves fully here, even the flames and
BSPs.  Whatever we write, it should be based on individual discretion and
not filtered by some unseen force.

Really, what would MTV think of this brouhaha?

haha.

So where is everyone going to be ?  For me, it looks something like
1015/Brothers & Sisters on Friday night with Tracy and . . .? on
Friday night, Organic on Saturday with (urp) MTV (offering Mostly
Terrible Videos since 1982), Diverse City with Ethan, Alex, Galen
and Graeme at Diverse (Big Heart) City [yow!] Saturday night, and
Sunset on Sunday with the Joe Rice Experience (heh) and more.

Larry asks:

Basically, it's about people being very wrapped up in their personal agendas.  

I'm constantly encouraged at how our differences become less significant 
when we find ourselves transcending our egos for a common love of music
and dance.  Perhaps if some of us participated more in the seemingly 
pointless act of raving for the sake of raving there would be a greater 
awareness of the underlying unity that connects us.  Then afterwards, we 
might not need to shout at each other in order to be heard. 

Sorry for wasting bandwith with such a boring post.  I'm *really* glad the
weekend is here. :)

Lee

Fraser,
 I don'tr think anyone on this list fears or loaths you

Maybe not, but I loath cleaning out copious self-aggrandizing E-mails with
seemingly little relevance...

I think the problem is that you are way too concerned with your own media
image and whether people percieve you as "the international rave guru"

Right on with that.  It calls to mind the lyrics of a song by the Disposable
Heroes of Hiphoprisy.  "They become shining examples, of the system, they set
out to destroy"  
That song is on an album entitled "Hipocrisy is the greatest luxury"    Hmm,
seems kind of relevant here, especially if certain individuals prostrate
themselves in front of the MTV cameras.  Maybe if we ignore it, it'll go
away.         Tom

THis is that flyer that i told y'all we were making up to attatch to
tickets for "rocket science" here on the 8th of july..thanks again for
everyone's inspirational words :)

this has the header "We are all connected"
____________________________
and do you know what connects us all?  On the net it's called
PLUR.  No, it's not a dishwasher detergent, it's an acronym that
stands for Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.  These are big words
and may be difficult to define but here are some ideas:
Peace: The calmness you find with those around you, and
also inside of yourself.  It's tough, we often have to work at it
but when you're at peace with others, with ourselves and with
our planet only good can come of it.
Love: The caring you feel for friends, for strangers, for
those in need and also for caring you show for yourself.  It's
symbiotic, it's about sharing whatever energy you put into
something will be returned to you!
Unity: This means we all share a lot of common things,
regardless of our age, gender, race, orientation, whatevah! We
are all human beings, we all need other people, & we're all in this
for the happiness experienced being around others.  Though we
may have differences, we all arise from the same source.
Respect: This may mean respect for others, their ideas,
their music, & their lives.  It's also respect for one's self; one's
body and the needs that it has (food, sleep).  Educating yourself
on the substances you ingest shows love and respect for your
body; passing on the knowledge to others shows respect and love
for your fellow person.
ecto@magnet.ca & spooky@magnet.ca
-------------------
this has the header "food for thought"
-------------------
Think about it... how many times have you  gone to a party,
waited in line for hours because the tickets were oversold, nearly
passed out when you got inside because it was overcrowded and
HOT, got pissed off because the sound (and the djs) sucked, and
ended up leaving at 3am when the cops came and closed the
party down? Now, we all know that accidents happen, but very
often problems occur when the promoters are unorganized and
concentrate more money on luxuries than on the essentials.
We decided to throw this event to offer party-goers something
that is a bit different; to expose people to different djs, different
stylesof music, but most of all to get us all together to HAVE
=46UN. English or french, black or white, 'oldskool' or 'newskool.'
This, for us, it what it's allabout: dancing to amazing music and
having fun together. Everything else is a bonus: the poster-sized,
full-colour flyers, the $500 clothes, the 10 zillion watt lasers,
the 16 zillion watts of lights, and the gallons of vicks=81.
We'd like to thank you for coming to our party and would like
your feedback, in whatever form (email, voicemail, in person,
smoke signals, etc.) as we DO care about what you think.
Remember, this scene is CONSUMER DRIVEN so, if you don't
like something, DON'T BUY INTO IT.  If you think a promoter is
wack (that includes us!) tell them and don't go to their parties.
They will either have to put on better productions or stop putting
them on altogether. Remember: YOU have the power to influence
the scene.
        thanks for your time, Keith, Ecto and Mateo
---------------------------
then the header says "Why are you here?" under which is...
---------------------------
There are many reasons to go to a party or to be a 'raver'; here
are some ideas that we got from all over via the internet:
"because we celebrate life and battle
because we are not satisfied
because it is up to us
because we love to sing and dance
because the pressure is upon us
because there are governments and borders and cops and courts
because the boundaries must be broken
because we are out of control
because they said we couldn't do it
because we feel like it" c/o Komotion International-San Francisco

"You can be anything you want here." -Penelope (Boston, USA)

"ACCEPTANCE! I luv that you can leave the shallowness of modern
social standards at the door and become part of the human family
again at a rave!" -Wendy (DC, USA)

"Raving should be a release of emotions, not a means of escaping
your inner feelings and fears.  Most of us fell in love with raving
because of the sense of community; we needed people to reach
out and touch us, but we didn't realize that what we needed to do
first was reach deep down inside and get in touch with our selves,
then we could spread the love.  At that point we would know
that the love is real; not just a reaction from E.
      We can only improve the scene if we improve ourselves first."
-'salami' (Toronto, Canada)
-----------------------------
well it wasn't done 100% perfect, there were things i wanted to fit in or
have changed but you know how it is working with people ;)
the other side of the paper is just the french translation which is pretty
important here as the francophone side is dissed a lot by the scene itself
which is very un-plury ;)
        hope ya'll like it...critical comments would be appreciated too!
                peace,

Oh boy, more personal attacks *YAWN*
If you go back, I have attacked your actions not you. Does attacking me as 
a person through "prose" somehow validate you?

Correct. When however, you espouse the same views, you will be put in the
position of taking some responsibility for those views.

I believe otherwise. Yes, it was agreed that we all post off-sub messages
from time to time, but that the CONTINUOUS off-sub THREADS that were coming
from your direction were getting ridiculous. Everyone else was not guilty of
doing this.

Yes, however you posted this as a representitive of your production company.

No David, to my knowledge you are the only one that has forwarded glowing
reviews of your own gigs to this forum. Crunch and everyone else have posted
reviews of OTHER PEOPLES' parties.

Well, you better go back and tell the CCITT that their I. series standards 
governing ISDN are really 5 standards. I do not belittle your technical
difficulties. All I am saying is that I am not impressed by the concept of
the link itself.

Now wait a minute, before bandying around the word "prejudice" I suggest 
you go back and read your comments on "yank one-dimensional minds," and
"JINGOISTIC yanks," before you run around calling others prejudiced.

Now after bitching at me for lumping you together with Fraiser, why are you
lumping me together with Bradley?

Do you feel better now? 

In the final analysis, do you believe that you have done yourself, or your
production company any favors by this flame war? Do you think that people
are going to be flocking to your events after these personal attacks? I am
just a person, I am not part of Cybersafari-anything. This exchange, while 
spreading some temporarily bad vibes to SFRAVES which I do apologize for, has
done me no lasting damage. Can you say the same?

HAHAHA! Ya know, I decided I like the idea of pointedly ignoring the MTV 
crew better than giving them recognition by wearing a T-shirt. Thanks to 
whoever brought up the idea of ignoring them.

Martin wanted me to pass along that there will be a sunset ceremony and
circle dance at Freedom around 8:45/9pm (whenever sunset occurs).
Immediately following this the music will begin. Doors will open at 7:30pm
and the party will continue to about 9am.

There will be two buses leaving from 5th and Folsom in SF - one at 9pm and
one at 1am. Free organic food and water will be served all night and you're
welcome to bring your own water in as well.

I'll be playing in the ambient tent from 5am - close. My goal is to inspire
ambient breakdancing at some point. =)

Other ambient/dub/jungle DJ's are Nick Philip, Malcolm and Rob. Dance DJ's
are Tony, Doran, Garth, Galen, Spun, Josh, and Jon Williams. Tickets are
$20.

More info: 415 905-9629 or 415 522-3994.

I'll also be spinning at Sunset on Sunday - 415 985-5264.

Joe

The trancendence of the ego. Easier said than done, isn't it.

Personal agendas, self interests, personal (as well as generational) 
conditioning. All this prevents us from relating to each other in a true 
manner of openess and respect.

So why is it that we an allow ourselves to be controlled by agendas, 
interests, and conditioning? 

Is it because we are UNABLE to shed this weight of agendas and 
conditioning, or is there some UNDERLYING MOTIVE that prevents us from 
reaching beyond these barriers?

Personally, I feel we all are aware of the barries that exist 
within ourselves and between others, it's just that we've gone through 
years of denial, an unacceptance of the negative aspects within  
ourselves, if you will. 

So, do we continue to go through life with our internal barriers, 
creating external barriers, divisions, misunderstandings, labeling and 
what not?

Or do we CHOOSE to accept the RESPONSIBILITY for our negative 
aspects, and take steps to undo the effects of conditioning and self
serving motives?

I believe that's where these parties come into play.  ;)

I'm reading a book called "Human Energy Systems" (Jack Swarz). The unity 
which Lee mentions is actually an energy which connects everything in 
this universe. 

Our internal barriers prevents the acceptance of this unity, and 
therefore, the acceptance of ourselves and others. 

Through our events, I've discovered many aspects that have 
prevented me from relating to others in an unconditional manner.  

I think I've died a million times since my first party. Some deaths have 
been more painful than others, but it's all leading to a beautiful place: 

FREEDOM

Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be talking energy. 

Pg. 19 of Human Energy Systems
 
	"The key to the healthy utilization of energy is creative 
expression. The best protection against harmful influences and lower forms 
of energy is to radiate energy yourself. Do not hold back your 
capacities; be spontaneous and joyous in everything you do. Do not 
compare yourself with others and worry about whether your capacities are 
higher or lower than theirs; just do it for the sake of doing. Do not 
hold the energy back for fear that someone will not like what you do; 
just keep bringing the energy up and out. That is the best guarantee of a 
healthy body." 

Hell, that's only page 19. I got 150 more to go!


See you all out and about this weekend.

I dont go to raves to debate but I know I wouldnt mind it.  If Tristan 
wants to debate then thats great.  You dont decide what should and 
should not happen at a party.  We do what we like (except hurt others). 
 Isn't that what is about?

   I LIKE Tristan because he says what he wants to say regardless if it 
fits the attitude that many of us have.  B your self  - whatever that 
is.  If others dont like it than thats there problem.

Hey all,

Why is MTV filming a rave?  They dont even play house music.  

We all know that MTV is Bogus bull-shit but it is MTV.  It is big time 
media.  The objective it to turn everyone on to this.  It is so magical 
that we must teach the world.  Dont you feel that desire to have the 
family grow?  If Organic goes off and MTV films it going off than that 
is just fantastic. It is almost an obligation to make it to this party. 
This is an excellent oppurtunity to turn someone out there on to what 
life is all about.  Fuck-Yea!!!

love chris
