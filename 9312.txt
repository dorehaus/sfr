P.S.  MAO Inhibitor is also a characteristic of anti-depressants that came
before Prozac.  One warning: these anti-depressants can cause "painful
prolonged erections" in males.  Don't know if that is related to Yohimbe
or not.

Does anyone have data on how strong an MAOI Yohimbe is and whether
it's a long or short term MAOI?

Any contraindications with using MDMA or 2CB with MAOIs?

MDMA is an amphetamine
                 ^^^^^

2C-B is a phenethylamine 
                   ^^^^^

So I would guess it could be a bad idea....

Sounds interesting. May have possibilities if (cautiously) combined
with other drugs. MDMA-2CB-Yohimbe sounds like a pretty ultimate
sexual experience.

It's very important to NEVER take MDMA with any MAU inhibitor (such
as Yohimbe).  One of the side effects could be death...

Subject: FX was In Motion last night
Status: 


For those of us who live in the south bay and have to work bright and early in 
the morning Come / Unity was out of the question.  However I did 
journey down to FX for Motion.  I wasn't around last weekend to witness 
the place in near hysteria unfortunetely, but last night I think 
was better.  There was actual room to breath.  Frankie started off 
early in the evening.  At that point there were only a few people 
dancing, myself included.  Rick went on next, he was excellent as 
usual, as of course he is my favorite DJ. Lastly was  Marky.  He 
as usual did a great trancy set. At least in my opinion.   I swore 
I was not physically present, but on a higher level.  He has a way 
of doing that, at least to me.  There was even enough room to breath and 
dance and walk even though there was a frenzy going on on the dance 
floor.  
It was a great time and cheap, $3.00 before 11:30 $5.00 after. So 
all of you who didn't make it too bad you missed out.  
Although I am sure Come Unity was excellent. I am still coherent 
here at work.  

You should come down to check out FX on Wednesdays at least once.  
You won't be disappointed.

	What can I say.
	For me this might just be the best party of the year.
	I had a REALLY INTENSE psychic experience there that
	was both scary and profound.  All of a sudden while
	I was deep in trance, I had this really intense 
	experience of "seeing" every one in the room, it was
	like I could read the emotions of every single person in the 
	room.  I also had somewhat of an out of body experience.
	No psychedelics were injested, but I did get a little
	"help" from a fellow sfraver.

	If these parties keep going like this, Mal might succeed
	in singlehandedly saving the Scene.

Status: 

The leaflet that I got with my yohimbe purchase had some aditional things to not eat or drink the
day before yohimbe ingestion, I'll try to dig it up and let the author of that FAQ know.  Also,
the FAQ says that it is an MAO inhibitor and not to drink alcohol with it.  As unlikely as it may
seem that somoone might mix the two, I think I remember reading (Mondo #3,4?) that when speed is
mixed with an MAO inhibitor that the toxicity builds up in the brain (because it's not being cycled
out) and will kill yo ass.  Am I remembering this corectly?  If so, maybe that should be mentioned
as well.

Sean, I haven't been paying attention to the delivery info on the mailing

you can combine Yohimbe w/ MDMA and likely not 2CB, either.  Could be VERY
dangerous.  Just don't want you to take the ultimate trip.

Trivial interesting fact:  I heard part of an interview with a women (can't

of the vibrations of Human DNA.  She mentioned another woman friend of hers
who has been medicaly evaluated to have a physioligicaly different inner ear
design than other humans and she can hear WAY high frequencies (don't remember
the range).  This woman apparently sings beautifuly strange with little or

Before we have twenty five more people posting the same thing, I got
the message about MDMA plus MAOIs. Yes, MDMA is an amine. That means
doing it with an MAOI may be dangerous.

How dangerous? In what dosages? DMT, a tryptamine, is often combined
with an MAOI to prolong the effect, though I'd say one would want to
reduce the dosage, given the typical DMT+harmaline experience. This
isn't to say that MDMA is doable with MAOIs at all; it might not be.

Does anyone have any references for this? I'm not so much interested
anymore in hearing another person say "it's dangerous" than I am in
getting some better data.

I'm sending this from home, so I'll be brief.  No tough choices
this weekend - just Wicked, Groove Kitchen, and the Bulletproof
boat party - although you still have a choice of our fine weeklies.

Also, I don't think I've given proper attention to the San Jose weeklies,
but I've been hearing a lot of positive comments about them (FreeLife,
Motion, Deep Space), so you South Bayers have no excuse for staying in
during the week!  (although I hear Deep Space has ended)

Fresh: SpaceLab (Thursdays), Elmo line is back up
Retired: Mission Rock, Drift, Delusions of Grandeur, possibly Deep Space?

Lee, I know it might be kinda close but I just wanted to remind you that
6 weeks after the equinox date (mar 20) is May day, a.k.a. Beltaine (May 1)
- the pretty much agreed upon first day of spring by most/all ancient european
cultures, particularly the more western pagan ones, hence it's adoption by
neo-pagans.  It's associated with sex, love, rebirth, happy-times and bon-
fires were often used, I think to symolize the fire of the sun on it's return.
Anyway, it's also on a sunday.

	No, it's indoors.  For being on this side of the bay, it's a real
cool space, and cool club.  I went two weeks back, and was mighty
impressed with Dj Francesco.  Stomping house, hint o' techno, and he
threw in MeatBeat's Helter Skelter in honor of Manson's b-day.  I've
got tickets to give away for there, on a regular basis, at KALX, Sat
nights, and damn, I've been shamelessly self-promoting all week!  I'll
stop.

Subject: yohimbe
Status: 

the current thread re yohimbe and MDMA/ 2CB combinations may lend itself to
a little clarification regarding the use of psychedelics

my own experience with yohimbe has been that at best it is a nasty tasting and unpleasantexperience, certainly not worth the time or effort of preparation.

The enhancing potential for sexual peaking was far diminished for me because of the nausea, chills and headache the preparation causes.

Yohimbe bark has been sold from ads in the back pages of "High Times" ever since the mag started coming out some 20 years or so ago. Figure... its not illegal
 yet, so it mustn't be any good... right? 

Mixing drugs to get "higher" is a practice to be discouraged.
 Responsible psychedelic use is directed toward maximizing the trip... that is,
 getting the most benefit, not necessarily getting  the most fucked up. The 
MAO inhibitor effect of yohimbe mixed with MDMA and or 2CB may be enough to put you in a box (kill you).

About asking your physician: the use of psychedelics is actively discouraged by medical professionals and the responses you get are going to be based on
 misinformation in most cases.
Most physicians are woefully ignorant of the distinctions between classes of
recreational drugs, as well as the distinctions among the psychedelics
 themselves.The usual practice is to promote the standard party line
so the information you will get is likely to be very simplistic.

Yohimbe is not a psychedelic, its aphrodisiac qualities are overrated and 
the experience is at best unpleasant. Certainly not worth the risk of
brewing a potentially deadly drug combination in your body, is it?

For enlightened psychedelic use

NO!  =)  
	But will the scene be the same later on. Will there ever be another rave
like the one I missed...   Whenever I don't go to something I know is gonna
be good I always feel like I'm missing out on something important.
Especially when people start typing in those reviews. 

	This feeling doesn't just pertain to raving but to life.  I want to get
the most out of my life and I am always seeking out to find it, that
something special.  Just like this list...If I hadn't taken that
Environmental Studies class that introduced me to newsgroups and e-mail
what would my life be like right now?  I have no idea but it would have
been a lot different!

	This feeling that comes over me is strong and very influential
especially when it comes down to deciding whether or not to do something. 
"Well, if I don't do it I may never get the chance to do again."  Thats a
pretty powerful thought!

	I would like to hear your thoughts.  Anybody else get this
feeling?  Comments and criticism welcome.  I'm not on nwraves so please
cross post to me or sfraves.
	
	Its great to have such a wide audience.  There's more opinions to
be heard and more info to learn.  I love hearing other people's thoughts
and opinions on topics of debate.  You can learn alot by pulling together
your thoughts and the thoughts of others...You have done a lot of thinking
and they have done a lot of thinking, combining the two you get a lot of
brain power.  By considering different opinions you can take in the best
part of their arguments and combine it with your's and eventually you'll have
the best theory...in your mind atleast  =)

	I hope I'm not just babbling and this makes sense to somebody out
there =)

this topic may turn stupid or turn into a flame war,
but i think i need to go through some kinda therapy here
so hey...

If i had not gone to UC, Irvine, i definitely would not
be ANY thing like who i am today
if i had not come in as an EE major, then i probably
would not have gotten the job i did that exposed
me to so many different aspects of the net
if i did not work for KUCI, i would not have been into new music
and would have probably not really cared as much about MARS fm
and would have missed the whole concept of raving
and if i had not been involved in a incoming student orientation
program then i probably would not have chosen to go into 
Women's Studies from engineering
boom. thats my life in a nutshell.

All of those choices are pretty major although each at the time
was given no significant amount of thought 
BUT in each of those i knew i was making a pretty important decision
except for the last one which has changed my life in more ways
than i coudl imagine

as someone who has never given a damn about school or scholastic stuff
i can say that now, at a point where i am seeing more of what is going
on in my life and the affects of my decisions, i totally 100% see how
important school really is in making life a bit easier

there's a DJ down here in OC who is 16 years old.. he just went on a 
road trip with Doc Martin and he will go from clubs to school when
he does after hours during the week

if i were in his position when i was in high school, i could not
have even thought of continuing
i mean i would have passed adn graduated and all, but i would
not really bother with taking Honors classes or 
trying to get good grades

being in the position i am now, i always urge him to stay in school and do
good and to study even if he has to pass up a good gig to do it
and most of the other people in the scene down here are saying likewise
in fact Most people who are older (that is, more experienced) would give
such advice
i really think there is a reason in that

personally i dont know how much i can really stand behind any of this
cuz right now im not listening to my parents and sticking with my 
major that they want me to leave because my life will be harder
but i understand that (though probably not to the extent that they do)
and i think i would be bored if life were easy,
but honestly if i had the choice of having life made a bit easier
by having a ton of money and i coudl get it without compromising
on my morals, then hell ya i would
hopefully if got instantly loaded then i would just actualize a lot more
things than i could without the money, and not just get
a more comfortable car

now as far as that ONE rave, that ONE concert that just cant be missed
i dont know.. i to feel like i am really missing out if i dont go to a
good event...
concerts are even harder calls, i mean the band might never come back
well.. im pretty much bored with concerts, but seeing Spiritualized
perform and feeling them perform would be a hard call over whether
that would be worth failing a test for
but not THAT hard... only at the time...
i mean you MIGHT miss running into that person who would just
put you in a state of everlasting bliss if you dont go to a rave
and happen to run into them,
of course you MIGHT miss impressing the hell out of said person
by aceing that test...

there are so many seemingly insignifcant choices that we make in our lives
that permanently change them and we never know that it is quite
pointless to dwell on even the ones that seem significant
after they have been made

although there are times when i will go out all night and party instead of
studying like i need to, but its not because i am worried about missing
something, it is more because i feel that i am spiritually lacking
and to be fully able to deal with anything i need to be spiritually filled

that or im just tricking myself and i just want to go out and live for now
instead of having some shred of responsibility towards my future
and the future of anyone else i will be supporting

man.. this is too long

gee, i didn't think that little comment was going to star anything but 
since it has, i shall add some more.....
 
	decisions are always life changing.  either to some degree of 
good or some degree of bad.  it is never very good to second guess your 
decision but there is always wisdom in reflecting back and learning from 
your bad and good decisions.  getting caught up in past decisions and 
second guessing can and will lead to indecision(which could be 
disasterous when in a pinch) and/or reduced self-esteem.  look ahead but 
with respect for the past.

	all this and raving, don't know.  raving to me is much, much more 
than the parties, clubs, drugs, and even music.  raving is an ATTITUDE!!!
don't get me wrong, i love to parties and everything that goes with them, 
especially the music.  i like most want them to go for as long as 
possible.  they can but not always in the form of today.  one problems 
the hippies of the 60's(i see as sorta of hippies who've embraced 
technology) is they didn't look ahead.  education is a big part of that.  
educating our selves and others.  NEVER pass up a chance to inform 
people.  a big problem with the scene in the soceity sense is 
misinformation.  if you are in public and hear someone say something that 
is misguilded, help them clear it up.  it show the world that we are well 
meaning educated people not a bunch of dope smoking lsd x-head as some 
would like you beleive. 
	 my decision was never to let he the rave scene 
die even if it means only inside myself.  i really hopes it never comes 
to that.  we, the raving community, have taken big steps in establishing 
ourselves for a time to come.  we are world wide in scope.  we tend to 
look ahead more than similar movements, ie. technology and the internet.  
hopefully we can last but whatever the case we have and will make a 
difference in this world.  those who one are making decisions that will 
shape our life and who were touched by the rave attitude, a decisionn for 
the better might be made because of that influence.  our childern will 
have a more accepting attitude passed on, and so on.  one day there will 
be a similar movement.  as we will be in the postion to do so, we should 
remember to help that one.  life is a cycle.  

	to gioni, one rave isn't going to matter.  education is more 
important in your long term happiness, although that doesn't mean you 
have to be unhappy now.  the trick in life is balencing your short and 
long term happiness.  good luck, the scene will here for a while(you 
might just have to search for it).

	to dana, i am proud to hear that you are looking forward to the 
challenge of schooling and life.  i great problem in education today is 
that students lose thier want to learn, i am glad you haven't.

	to all, educating others while uniting together is the only the 
scene shall exist for any extended length of time.  keep that smile going.

a better place.  Even if you stop raving be a raver in your heart.  About 
education, I'm going to the University of Oregon and education is playing 
an important part in my life.  To do something for our future we must 
educate ourselves and others about what is going on around us.  Missing 
an event is not the end of the world.  I started going to the Full Moon 
in June and now I have a problem getting to it considering I'm twelve

Ben obviously wasn't there, nor did he find anything informative of that

examined the effects of dispersed computing technology long before any of
the technology was available to us.  Many of us did nothing but look ahead.
Many of us dreamed of the effect of effect-specific neuro-transmitters.
Many of us still monitor how well parts of society, i.e., ravers, as well

Many of us even refine/change our dreams to reflect new data.

I didn't think that you were trying to take away from that time,
I just wanted to add my perspective from someone who was a "kiddie hippie"
(sorta like the 15 and 16 year old ravers you see today, they wiil be around
and be able(willing?) to participate in the Next Wave when it hits the
planet around 2011.) in the 60's early 70's, was in college during the
"disco" era (the Bee Gees didn't invent and are NOT real disco artists folks),
lived through the mental/psychic holucaust of the 80's and is around to see
the psychedelic re-mergence (as you so aptly put it) in the nineties.

exactly... thats why it really bugs me when new people, young or old, aren't
welcomed into the community, or when a DJ snubs someone that wants to learn
to spin. It teaches the newcomer that cliques are the norm, and if they arent
totally discouraged by the experience, and if they eventually do make friends
in the community or make a name for themselves, they could start doing it. 
People say that the scene is dying... I think its just going underground again,
but if in your area it really is going to hell, please, do something about it!
We have something really special going on here, and we owe it to the world to
make sure that it doesnt die!

I was born after woodstock, and my parents were hippies. And, like Ben, I think

Most of the time Randy I agree with you, but this time I gotta go with Ben.
 Yes, there was an examination of dispersed computing technology, but WHO
did it benefit?  Certainly NOT the masses, certainly NOT minority groups
(who are STILL underrepresented in tech circles).  The "projected dreams",
have been, IMO, rather self-serving, since dreams themselves are rarely
shared (this includes  civil rights). 

To me, the 60's were just a time for some middle class white kids to show
how pissed off they were for no apparent reson.  Many of these "hippies"
became "yuppies" and aspouse the same crap they fought against in the 60's.

Many of the folx (Af. Am./Native Am./Latin Am./Euro Am.) who got into civil
rights became puppets of the "system" (read "the MAN", read "leaders"). 
And to this day are still grabbing for the straws MX & MLK left behind.

As for technology, all we have is the same of stuff.  SOME people have
access, while many do NOT.  Most notably, the people who have the moajority
of access to technology are, for lack of a better term, Euro Am.  Most
others are left in the dust when it comes to tech.  And I do NOT think that
this was/is a mistake.

I am outraged by Bob Herbert's "In America" column of Sunday, Dec. 5.  In
  it, he espouses upon the apparent success story of the Quantum
  Opportunities Program, while largely ignoring the obvious flaws.  Let me
  begin my attack by quoting him directly,

     They were poor kids... All were black... [later] Nonsense was not
     tolerated... "Young ladies were expected to wear stockings," she said,
     and no one wore sneakers... The youngsters were taken to plays and to
     the opera.  There were outings in which they wore tuxedos and gowns.
     They were taught the proper way to behave in restaurants and were not
     spared the perennial, "Keep your elbows off the table."

Why is it that we are so easily seduced into believing this to be a success
  story?  It is clearly true that the program achieved its desired goal of
  "keeping these kids off the streets", but at what cost?  The framework in
  which these children were taught strictly reflects a reality which Mr.
  Herbert (and perhaps many or most of Times' readers) reflect.
  Specifically, I am talking about the "middle-class, Caucasian-American"
  culture.

But that reality is far from the one in which their parent's would
  subscribe to, if given the money.  Even the black leaders, many of whom
  have radically different agendas, all agree that no success counts if a
  people are to forego their culture in the name of "success", especially as
  measured against the values dictated by that other culture.

I am not trying to downplay the difficulty of finding a solution to the
  problem of how to "redefine" the urban-black culture, which is currently
  mired in a neverending stream of drugs, anti-semitism, misogyny, violence
  and other destructive lifestyles.  One can follow the usual lines of
  thought, all of which lead to dead-ends- they have no culture to
  "restore".  The message of the black leaders is clear: the greatest crime
  committed in all of the racism of this country's history was the robbing
  of whatever culture existed after the end of slavery.

His editorial presents a solution and a hope- but it is preaching to the
  same cultural choir that considers no alternative lifestyles equal to its
  own, and which measures all human value in terms of financial
  productivity, quality of dress, and eating manners.  Please don't allow
  yourself to preach indoctrination as a solution.

	Well, I hope that people like you, and Ben, and Poier are around 
to keep the scene strong.  I know that it also falls upon those of the 
younger generation to support the "raving" way of life, but it's 
difficult.  Especially for me, because of geography.  The scene here just 
doesn't exist, and it's sort of sad because Spokane, WA is the closest 
place to find the parties.  But, I have hope because Spokane does have 
it's own style, and the parties are persisting.  Even if the guys that do 
the ones that I go to decide to stop, I think that others will be there 
to pick up the baton and go.
	Anyway, I just wanted to thank you all for contributing to a 
lifestyle that IS unique, and IS worthwhile, and don't let the media, or 
other sources of depression convince you otherwise.  I may not fit the 
media stereotype of a "raver" (i.e.: drug taking, disillusioned, 
generation X-er, Dr. Seuss Hat wearing, evil menace  8-)   )  BUT:  (and 
this is important)  I think that the culture that has been designed 
around the raves, one where people can get along, and be accepted because 
they are human, is one that I embrace, and will support.  I want to be 
able to hug my fellow humans without fear of retribution.
	I want a place to go, and I don't want to have to fit into a 
stereotype to go there.  So, I rave.  I love to dance, I love to be with 
other people that are energetic, or blissed (or stoned), because there is 
a good vibe that goes along with that.  I don't want to see that decay 
into the world of Cliques:  OOOHHH!  Buffy, look at HIM, he's not wearing 
a dust mask, and he's not dancing like we are.  Ick, he's different!!!!

Well, there's my piece, I hope that that makes some sort of sense.  In 
essence, I have never had a "scene" or clique to call my own, and I don't 
want one, unless that happens to be a clique of people, a clique of human 
beings gathered together for the purpose of escaping their troubles and 
building a sense of community.  There is the place that I want to exist in.
Enough, I shall let you reply now....thank you for your bandwidth.

I hear people say to do something to save the rave scene a lot.  The fact
is, I'm often at a loss as to what to do.  Perhaps I'm just not seeing
clearly but there just seems like there aren't too many outlets to
contribute in creating and changing raves.

Since members have been talking about the 60s, I want to add my bit too. 
I was born in '72 and I'm too young to remember the immediate 60s fallout.
But, I've been exposed to folks who've were very much a part of the
Sixties and contributed heavily in its fruition.  One person in particular
has taught me a lot about the commitment and sacrifice it takes to make
social change blossom.  He made me see raving in a whole new light. 
Raving is a movement for social change which requires commitment and
sacrifice from many devoted folks to make it work.  And to some extent, I
see this happenning.

At other levels, I don't see it.  In the Sixties, people worked hard and
sacrificed their time doing arduous organizing to make their visions come
true.  People came together to get their hands (and butts) dirty sitting-in,
marching, and creating their People's Park.  They were willing to get
arrested and beaten to see changes they felt had to happen in society.

I have reason to believe that raving doesn't inspire these elements
enough.  Ravers, though they talk serious, don't back it up with much
action or will.  I'm not speaking about the minority of committed folk who do
spend a lot of time putting together raves and keeping the movement
progressing so we can enjoy it.  Others do not seem willing
to sacrifice the time, energy, or even money to make raving better and
increase the significance of it.  Perhaps the raving masses aren't given
enough opportunity to contribute other than paying a twenty spot at the
door.  Perhaps raving isn't supposed to be serious enough to speak about it
in such big terms.  But it seems people do want to compare it and equate it
with something as powerful and significant as what happenned in the Sixties. 
Well, If we're going to make these lofty comparisons, we're going to have
to earn our right to do so.  

I'm really curious to hear what others have to say in response.  I'm sorry for
rambling and sounding all pretentious.  Please tell me if I'm being too
critical or off-base.  I'm just being so because I love
what I've seen and want to love it even more.  Raving and all the people
involved have such great potential, I want us all to experience it as
fully and completely as possible.  These are some feelings that
I've been holding in for a long time now.  I FINALLY, actually told this to
people who might care to listen.  I thank you all for providing the
correct context in which to get rid of this emotion.

I feel much the same way.. I don't have a lot of connections in the "scene" 
here in Vancouver, since I've only really started to get into it myself within
the last 3-4 months, and also I don't get to a lot of events because I'm a 
university student and perpetually broke. Hopefully, my part time job next
semester and co-op in summer will give me the opportunity to get out more, 
maybe down to Groove Kitchen, Basics, or some other across-the-border events
so's I can meet all of ya!

but I digress...

the point is, when I get my act together, have some extra dough, and know some
more people around here that want to help, I'd *love* to organize something,
say, a Full Moon Rave on Wreck Beach at UBC. And dammit, I'm going to. I'll be
the first to admit that even thinking about throwing something like this is
rather daunting, but hey, if you screw up you learn from your mistakes, and
the next one will be better! Thats how you build a scene, by creating a vibe
a community will naturally form around it (with enough work)... then, some
of the work can come off your shoulders and the community will support itself.
well, it sounds good in theory... maybe by summer or fall I can test it out!

not that I'm dissing the pplz already here in vancouver... I admit I haven't
been to many events here, but it seems that most everything is centered around
clubs and other weekly venues... which can be good, but doesn't really have the
homespun/grassroots/luv/peace/harmony groove that really attracts me.

plus nobody has ever handed me a lollipop :(

gay rights though i am not gay.  i fought for health care reform and the

against these crimes all is taken care of.  not so.  laws shouldn't be 
needed on how you should treat people, that should come from within.  
however, that sometimes seems to much to ask from people.  the 60's 
fought to have these laws put in place and rightfully so.  we now have to 
contuine and try to do our part by changing form within.  accually 
changing the way people see things.  it is good if people don't degrade

acheived when the people beleive in the laws because the law is just.  
banding together to get a law or policy changed is one thing, changing 
the way people think is another.  only through personal contact, i 
believe, are we only to accomplish that.  we still band together, although.

keep the scene alive.  wow, that is a hard one...the scene is growing (at

is somewhat down but the accual "base" scene is growing.  how to keep in 
alive is a complex problem.  one important aspect is keeping it alive in 
you and SHARING it with others.  as long as people feel welcome and 
accepted they will come back.  there are many other aspect that others 
can share but i feel sharing the vibe and yourself is the most important.

     Nothing personal, but I don't buy into the notion of Rave as
religion.  At 24, I have both seen and experienced alot.  I have "seen the
minds of my generation destroyed by madness, raving hysterical, naked" so
to speak.  I've learned the scene is arbitrary and transient, there is no
solidarity in it.  With one generation leaving and another one coming in,
I see both a change in atmosphere and ideas, of beliefs and attitudes. 
Not that this is bad; in fact, it keeps the scene fresh and alive.  We
older cynics almost believe again.  However, without a foundation, the
scene is subject to outside infiltration, like a recent outbreak in
violence at raves.
     Personally, my mission in life is seeking God, and unity
with God, however I can.  Rave is just one "part or particle of God", one
minute detail of the oversoul.  When I dance and reach the spiritual
epiphany of becoming the physical manifestation of the music, I am
exstatic. I personally don't need drugs to do this.  In fact, it is better
without drugs.
     I seek to perfect my self as much as possible in all facets of life,
for doing so brings me closer to my God.  Physically, I exercise and eat
right, don't do drugs or other harmful things as much as possible. 
Mentally, I keep my mind alert through reading books, writing poetry and
reading this list--you guys are really mentally stimulating.  Spiritually,
this is the private area of my life and if you really want to know that
bad, E-Mail me and I'll answer you personally.  Socially, I go to Raves
and talk with friends with similiar interests.  Psychologically, well,
that's private to.
Well, that's my personal philosophy on life.  Till later

In my ongoing struggle figure out what the meaning of life is, I have been
forced to conclude that *ultimately*, there is none.  But obviously, if I
really believed this, I'd have a hard time getting out of bed each morning.
In the end, it is up to each of us to create an illusion of meaning for
ourselves, or to buy into an illusion that will make life worth living.
With no *ultimate* laws of good/bad for us to follow, each of us must take
responsibility for the illusion we believe in.
 
So how do we decide on what's really important?  Is the goal mainly to
experience pleasure?  To help others feel good?  To acquire knowledge?
To destroy everything that irritates us?  To go to every great party?
 
Basically, it's whatever works; whatever illusion that keeps getting us
out of bed each morning.  But although it's not always easy to maintain
belief in an illusion that we've created (or has been created for us),
The really important thing is that WE HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE.
 
Each of us is God at the center of our Universe, deciding what is
right/wrong/good/bad/fun/stupid.  But at the same time, it is hard to
ignore that underneath it all, we just don't really matter.
 
My life on this puny planet is ultimately pointless, but I celebrate my
ability to CREATE a point.  At a rave, we come together from each of our
self-maintained illusions of meaning and celebrate our ability to believe
in ourselves and each other in the face of the fact that this is all one
big crock of shit.  The truth is that everyone is right, and everyone
is wrong, but life goes on because for some reason we believe that it
should, and because sharing in the absurdity of it all if not worthwhile, 
can at least be fun.
 
For me, raving is not an escape.  It is a surprisingly meaningful ritual;
an experience that celebrates our ability to generate and feel the
energy of the Universe, where the beat of music is like the pulse of 
reality: yes/no/yes/no/yes/no/yes... where together we dance with Truth  
and connect, and know that the illusion of life is real.

 I have to agree with this idea of missing out.  A lot of times it is hard for 
 me to juggle work, school, and going out. and then if I have any time at 
all left, clean my apartment and try and prepare for the next week.  
I definetely have a rule not to go to San Francisco during the week 
unless it is a special occasion.  I was a little sad that I didn't 
go to the last Come/Unity, because it sounded like so much fun, but 
then again I personally have to draw the line somewhere.   A lot of times I 
choose to stay in and be responsible.  Then I hear how great this 
was or that was or someone that I really wanted to see who I haven't 
seen in awhile was at such and such, and was asking for you, etc 
etc.  You get the general idea. (Now I am rambling)  Anyway when 
I do go out, I do make it a good time one that I can tell people 
that were not out about.  This way I don't go to everything, and 
I don't get bored of the music or dancing.  Does this make sense?
I think it is also good to have a balance between going out, and 
going out dancing.

No the scene will definetely not be the same later on.  It is constantly 
changing.  I just got into it a little over a year ago, and it is 
not even the same.  Some of the people are the same, but the attitudes, 
and the music are completely different. as well as what is the scene 
as we know it now, will be different in a couple of months. I think 
that is one of the things that is appealing.  The music is so diverse 
that you have a choice where to go.  DJ's seem to find a niche and 
stick to it so if you are familiar with them, you know where they 
are, and you go there.

I agree with as well.  I do however have to remind myself to appreciate 
each and every thing I do. If I do miss something I planned on previously, 
I think, well that happened for a reason, and I got to do this instead.

Yes but maybe you didn't miss out on much, or maybe you got to the 
chance to do something else that you wouldn't have done if you had 
done the first thing.  And then another chance comes around and you 
didn't end up missing anything.

Status: 

It's interesting that someone should contrast rave and religion.
Someone who's "not in the scene" commented to me the other day that my
trying to get him involved is not unlike religious people trying to
get people involved.

It gave me pause for thought.  There are a lot of similarities.  I've
found something really good in my life, something that helps me find
and share a lot of love.  So I want to bring it to other people, to
give them a chance to share in it too.

Rave really isn't a dominant force in my life.  The love I've had
inside all along and wanted to share is the force, and raves were a
means to unlock that love.  I find a lot of people feel the same, that
deep down there is a lot of love and caring wanting to get out, but
there's been so much pain that it can't.

That's what I'm focusing on in raving, and in other aspects of my
life.  I want to help other people have a positive experience, draw
them out and help them express that love.

Interestingly enough, it was that aspect of religion that drew me into
church involvement in 1979.  Hatred and intolerance, however, drove me
away.

I think I'd be attracted to any group espousing roughly the same
values and goals.  Love, community, respect, tolerance,
connecting--are these not things we can all agree on?

Sometimes the ego part of me wonders if I'm not being excessively
sappy about it sometimes.  I don't like that part of myself anymore.
The part of me that says "don't, it's silly" or "they probably won't
like you" has been responsible for more pain than anything else in my
life.  Silly?  Sappy?  So be it.  "Sooner or later," I tell people,
"you need to start reconciling your actions with your beliefs."  I
believe in love and reaching out to people.  I always have, and
lately, I've started to act like it.

To some people, a rave is just a party.  To others, it may be a
vehicle for personal or social transformation.  Change the world?  I
don't know; I'm not that ambitious. For me, if we can come together
and make something beautiful happen, it's enough.  A lot of people
don't get very much love in their lives.  If one person at a party can
experience a wonderful vibe and feel comfortable and loved, then I
consider that party a roaring success.

There are a lot of similarities.  It is part of the attraction for

I've been there myself.  Boy do I understand that pain,  a pain that

its victim. >

There are other groups not religiously affiliated espousing similiar
principals that have shown me enough love that they have started me on the
healing process.  Write me if  you are interested.

I spent way too long covering up feelings I thought were uncool.  Ever
heard of terminally hip and fatally cool?  Don't be ashamed of your feelings
, it's what makes you human and makes human beings beautiful creatures of the
universe.  If people tease me about being artsy-fartsy or excessively
intellectual or emotionally sensitive, I say thanks.  To me, its a
compliment now.

John, did you forget about the Viet Nam war, segregation, and the general

A lot of white people were (are) tired of getting a bad name from white

the hippy generation and I don't buy it.  The types of people who did this

Everyone

you've brought up some excellent points about the meaning of life,
raving, religion and love.  

upon joining this group I had some strong ideas of what raving
meant and what I wanted out of this experience.
i went to my first real rave-a big BLOWOUT production one year ago as
of november.  let me tell you it was an awesome experience!!
i found a kinship and a child-like attitude that was missing or better
yet 'tucked' into my soul.  the laughing, skipping, rebelliousness
was something i most admired since i've always considered myself
a closet rebel.  back to my reasons for getting more involved is,
to bring back those ole' childhood memories that adults seem to forget
like sharing, caring for one another and open acceptance of people.
(thought i can remember being a mean little snot..)

sometime i too feel like i,m missing something. especially the rave-atmosphere
in sf. i don't know what it is, maybe the closeness and the cultural
diversity, but sf seems to be in the sharing-caring spirit -though
some of you may beg to differ.

so G- all i can say is don't worry about what you missed because
it will be there.  you could have been there (at rave X) and had
a totally negative vibe, OR a good one...

about religious enlightment, i have to agree with Gioni that a bit steep.
however dancing into an altered state can be a religious experience.
raving is a mobile, artistic expression, reaching beyond outer limits.
in other wrds, u don't sit around holding up a wall and guzzling beers-
which you see at xnightclub.  

i'm still learning a lot and this rave-stuff has touched a nerve,
just like why i have an interest in the 'pentecostal' religion.
God is praised with upward hands, the spirit moves through you-
via the gift of dance, vision or speaking in tongues.

hhhmmm raving can do this also- ok Sean I'm starting to see you point!!!



to you old-schoolers
i'm curious what is the rave philospy back in the early days? (besides the drug
stuff) and how do you view it presently?    and what do you hope for the future?

To save the life of someone I love.

The future of the planet.

To set a group of people free.

That's one way of looking at it. When I heard this, it made me think
of the people that tell me that "Love is when you care about someone
more than you care about yourself."  It's an attempt to pin a concrete
definition on a very intangible thing. For me, love is a feeling,
something that comes from deep inside. It doesn't seem to follow any
rules, as some people would tend to think. Rather, like many things in
the universe, it just is, and we do a rather poor job of explaining
its nature, even though we emotionally grasp it. It's much like an
impressionist painting -- it's not well suited for viewing with a
magnifying glass. Rather, one needs to step back and simply "feel" it.

This is also sort of like categorizing people into stranger, friend,
SO, etc..  For me, all elements and depths of the feelings spectrum
are there with each person with whom I connect. Quantizing it into one
of three or four categories seems to want to diminish it, to strip all
all that spectrum of color out of it so it can be conveniently
explained.

The meaning of life? Would any two people agree on this? :). Would it
be so bad to be able to decide our own meaning? I wrote to Lee:

	while wondering around doing my thing during the last halloween 
rave, i was giving out my famous massages.  we were lucky and the 
carpeted floor allowed a beautiful place to do it.  towards the end of 
each massage i whisper a saying to my resipent.  my favorite is:
	
	i honor the place in you
	where the universe resides,
	i honor the place in you
	of love, light, truth, and peace,
 	i honor the place in you
	when you are in that place in you
	and i am in that place in me,
	we are only one

several times that night i was told i should start my own religion.  i 
don't know how much they meant it but it meant a lot to me.  i am still 
trying to figure out a way to organize a similar group.  i think it would 
do the scene good if there was some kind of weeky or bi-week event where 
people would come and discuss ideas, like we do here.  i don't want 
something where one person or small group gets up and preaches down but a 
interactive group, all sharing and learning.  from what i understand ysh 
has discussions before thier events.  what are like?  to those in the 
northwest (especially seattle), would you support such a gathering.  
we talk of unitifing, this is a step.  ideas please for this has been in 
my head since long before halloween.  cheers to you all.

Greetings from the Fluid Groove posse!

We apologize for any inconvenience, but we've had to change the date of
our next party.  It is now scheduled for Sunday afternoon, December 12.
That's next Sunday.  We haven't signed a contract for the space, but
I don't expect any trouble with that.  We have DJs Susan and Doran
confirmed for the dance room, and Joe Rice will be coming up from
LA to provide deep ambient tunes in our chill out area.  As always,
audio is provided by Sound Vision.

This is an all ages event in a smoke-free, no alcohol space (if we get
the one we're working for).  There will be ins and outs.  Up to this
point, we've been relying on your generosity to keep us going, and 
so held free parties.  This hasn't been working out for us--we haven't
even come close to meeting our expenses.  So, we're asking for five
dollars at the door.  We're not going to be Nazis about this, but we
do ask for your monetary support so we can continue to bring you the
best new spaces and talent.  For final details, please call the number
below in my .sig on Sunday morning.

Liquid Air sees the full light of day!

	Well, I for one would love to see such a forum, unfortunately, 
i'm trapped in Moscow, Idaho, and have no way to reach most Seattle 
raves, or events without major planning and luck.  If such a discussion 
could be done over the net, on a chat server somewhere, then I'd love to 
take part in it.  Otherwise, by all means get one started in 
Seattle...I'll just have to wait until my next road trip....8-(

	However, Some live forum to sit down and chat would be a lot of 
fun, as well as informative.  Well, there's my little piece.  See y'all 
later!

And I'm sure that others can come up with equally noble ideals.

I have a problem with this approach.  First of all, how could you ever
be sure that your death will result in *any* of these things, since you
won't be around to know?  I might *risk* my life for some of these
things, but throw it away?  I'd have to pretty damn sure things would
work out in my absence and not be negated by some new set of circumstances.  
Very iffy.  The dying-for-a-cause illusion just doesn't work well for me.

On the other hand, I can see how some would feel that the ideals that 
worth living for are the ones they *think* they might die for.  It's a 
powerful illusion and has fueled many wars.  But I believe that if you 
really do end up dying for an ideal, you've probably been duped.  

ObRave: Anyone have any details on the free GG Park party in the bandstand 
being put on by the FunkyTechnoTribe people?  Is it this weekend?  Although 
it's not something I would die for, it would still give my life a little 
more meaning for the next few days if I had it to look forward to. :-)

One of the best definitions of love was the following...
Love is much, much, much, MUCH more than a feeling...it's more of a choice...it
becomes something much more to work for, it becomes a very concious decision to
Love someone.  I choose to love you, therefore I accept the pain and the
pleasures from this choice.  It makes love something that you have to
constantly put effort into, rather than relying on infatuation.  That in itself
is a really nice feeling, but once infatuation leaves, once you get "used" to a
person, then that's where true love starts kicking in.  this is where you
Choose to be with that person and work the relationship...

There's a lot more to it, but that's the general gyst.  For those of us who are
in love, we know how rich and chaotic and wonderful the experience is.  And how
much work it is...

Lets see, it's been about a month, yup it's about time for another SFR
flamewar.  :O

Before everyone starts stomping on each other's ideals, lets all take
a moment to realize that people can value things for their own reasons that
likely others just won't understand.

Also, its very likely most of us could care less about the things
other people hold dear if they don't overlap with our interests.
(At least before our friends let us know about their ideals.)
Shallow, but true.

Hi Everyone!

  I think I've finally figured out why my mail was getting chopped.
[It sucks to spend time on a post that never appears.]

  First off, let me say that I've enjoyed the recent thread on Raving
philosophies.  In my 1 year+ of participation, my take on the whole
THING has changed a lot. 

First,  IT was great music to dance to.
Then,  IT was the discovery of and subsequent quest for the vibe.
After that, I spent a while trying to find the meaning of IT all.
Not finding meaning, IT became my reward/motivation for working hard.
After work got easy, IT became just a pary & ended up consuming me. :(
Then I took a break.  Whew!
Since then, IT has been learning that IT can be all of these things
& more....

  Recently, I've been full of wonder.  Wondering what all these people
around me that I see everywhere do & what they are like & what their 
take on IT is.  

  Also, the possibilities...a party seems like an bubbling potion ruled 
by the unknowns of human chemistry....

[Hmmm, I didn't think I had much to say.]


  Getting to the point...got this flyer:

late nite sounds
1015 folsom
friday, december 10th
mark Farina + deric Carter on 4 turntables 
[I've heard they are incredible!!]

  Also, at Mushroom Jazz got a flyer for something on Tuesday's 
at Spike's (8th & Minna), 10pm-2am, $3, HouseMusic w/ a bunch
of dj's, but the only name remember was John Howard.  BTW, Thomas 
rocked Mushroom Jazz last night--check this guy's new sound out!


Well, that's all.  Good Day, friends...

I think the more important question might be:

What, in the face of extreme adversity, would inspire you to find the will
to continue living?

Each of us, I'm sure, has our own list, full of wishes for each other 
and ourselves. To me, death seems such an unlikely choice to express 
the meaning of life. I would never wish martyrdom for Geoff or for 
anyone (even despite their/his own feelings about it), as I much prefer 
the contributions (for better _and_ worse) each of us can make as 
imperfect, mutable, LIVING beings. Remember the saying: keep it alive

I disagree.  The things I would die for are exactly opposite to the
meaning of life, since they all mean I won't be living anymore.

Nothing is worth dying for except yourself, and that is only true in the
rare case that you are kept alive against your will.


So what is worth LIVING for?  Here's a short list of mine, in no
significant order:

1) Freshly baked bread at 2 AM
2) Unsolicited hugs
3) Edwardo's pizza
4) Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, friends.
5) Psilocybin mushrooms, the Black Rock Desert, and any combination thereof
6) Come/Unity, Penelope's Web, Liquid Air, Wicked, Taste, ...
8) Jorge Luis Borges
9) Crash Worship
10) Cannondale bicycles, Alum Rock Park, and any combination thereof
11) Harlan Ellison
12) Backrubs
...

Too abstract for me.  If you are willing to die for someone else you
have sacrificed your life to them already.  

Warning:  Self-sacrifice has been shown to cause government, religion,
and morals in otherwise sane humans.

Okay, that's one test.  Not attempting to be critical or divide the 
issue into semantic black-&-white...here's my $0.02.

The flip side might be what are you willing to LIVE for?  To set out to 
accomplish something, live with its consequences and continue to move 
the planet through the onwards-and-upwards spiral may be a little 
better use of the gift of life than to die and be free of whatever 
residual consequences there may be.

I'm definitely willing to live for making the world a better place for 
the next generations to grow up in and inherit.  Specific to raving, I 
definitely see that those _brilliant liminal moments_ , busting it to 
really phat wax, contributes to greater personal expression and 
freedom, adding enormously to my own baseline of positivity.  And IMO, 
the more positivity I experience, the more I'm able to create and 
return that positivity...

Just do your thing and let the critics stand back.  I had an experience
somewhat like you describe this morning on Caltrain riding to work.  I
was listening to the Garth CD on my walkman (which *still* rocks pretty
hard, IMHO...) and started rocking in my chair, etc.  I was getting
more and more into it and then I decided to just stand up and start dancing.
Needless to say, some of the corporate stiffs in the train car started
giving me this "you're not conforming to accepted social protocol"-type
of disapproving looks...to which I somehow managed to respond (retaining
my self respect somehow through the indignant looks I recieved...) with
a wide grin and completely non-sensical hand and body gestures (I *was*
dancing, ya know!).  Referring back to the discussion on our fave places
to listen to house/techno, I found that dancing all the way to work on
the train put me in an undescribably great mood especially considering I
had to go to work!  Of course I was dripping with sweat by the time I got
there, so I guess my co-workers will be giving me a wide berth today, but
hey, it was GREAT.

'The Shoreline'

it lies within this landscape
in which we travel
a certain knowledge
an intuition of meaning
greater than can possibly be articulated

try as we might
we wail against a wall
of emotions
collective experiences
desires

our consciousness bludgeoned
against  the craggy shoreline
of our faults

intolerance acting as virtue
a battlement of righteousness
built upon the foundation
of indifference

what we percieve to be insight misleads us

what we believe to be just condemns us

An attack on an idea is not a personal attack aimed at the individual,
it's simply a disagreement.  Instead of getting offended by attacks on
your  opinions,  why not learn from them.  realize that these attacks are
simply the opinions of others.  If opinions or beliefs are never attacked
or argued then they will rarely change.  

These discussions about life and raving is why i'm on this list.  I like
to here others opinions, state mine(occasionaly), and see the responses of
others...even if they disagree with me.  If we all just state our ideas,
and we all agree, nothing would be accomplished.

sorta short but I have to work.  Everyone on this list and any of
your freinds are invited.  The address is: 1211 Oregon St. in
Berkeley.  That's 2 blocks N of Ashby, and 2 blocks E of San Pablo.
People comming long distances should take the Ashby exit off Hwy 80,
turn left at San Pablo, turn right at Oregon and go about 2 blocks. 
It's a baige house, brown trim, with a rainbow colored motorcyle
parked in front of it, on the street (can't miss it, in other words).
If anyone needs more/better directions mail or call me - 548-2356.
I offer a stereo (sorry, no 1200s), couches, kitchen, computer, dog,
etc. but as always, bring your own food.  Looking forward to
seeing/meeting some of you, let's try to make these semi-regular.

This depends on how the attack was worded.  I like disagreements but there
is a fine line between a personal attack and a disagreement.  Whoever
it was that said that being a nationalist ruins this planet or whatever they
said is a personal attack on a personal opinion.  The attacker had no idea
why that person said they would die for Israel.  If you don't know their
reasons why and you still attack them you are attacking them personally
and you are also attaking the issue and not the interests inside the
issue.  
	To clarify I will give an example...Suppose two people want an
orange but there is only one orange.  So the y get into an arguement about
who gets the orange, this is the isse.  However if they had asked WHY they
wanted the orange they would have found out that one of the person's wants
the orange peel to make frosting while the other one wants the inside to
eat, these are the interests.

	I will clarify even more the difference between attacks and
dissagreements.  This is how to disagree:
	
	1.  Focus on the problem not the people involved.  
	2.  Identify and communicate the interests not the issue.
	3. Identify other interstes and options around the problem.
	4.  Remove "face" from the arguement. don't attack their face,
	    argue interests.

>   Instead of getting offended by attacks on

	First of all I haven't been attacked at all I am just making the point
that I don't like it period! (errr exclamation point)	I am not offended by
someone who disagrees with me.  I am offended when somebody blatantly
attacks me or somebody else.  

	If these attacks were simply the opinions of others they wouldn't
be attacks they would be disagreements.  And yes it is true that if their
were never disagreeements then we would rarely change our opinions. 
That's why I opened this whole thread up with my opinion on life and I
asked, "Please share with us your own opinions."

But somebody did not just state their opinion they attacked somebody
elses.  Thats my point if people did just state their own opinions
everything would be fine but instead they just attack others opinions
without any justification.

I hope this clears up my last post about stating your own opinion while
not attackign others.  If it doesn't please mail me,

You know as I took CalTrain to go to Boogie Buffet early sunday morning,

I like this idea, if only I could think of a logical end destination :)

Anyone wanna do some research on this?  How much would you pay?  I'd
probably pay $40 to ride around for a night on a party train.

But I think most importantly:

Is a train stable enough for DJ's?

Subject: On Making a Difference
Status: 

The other day on Live 105 (in SF), Alex Bennett brought up an interesting
point.  He said that looking at the outpouring of money, volunteerism and
overall emotional support that was flowing freely in the wake of the
(pre-tragic conclusion) Polly Klaas kidnap case, he couldn't help but wonder
what type of immediate impact we could make on major social problems, such as
homelessness, if we approached those issues with the same zeal as we did the
plight of this one individual.

Far from minimizing the efforts of the masses in rallying together in
response to this dark event, I think the high level of personal
responsiveness in this case (and ones similar to it) raises the specter of
what really ails our society today:

If we can look at the suffering of one child and feel incredible pain, how
can we at the same time continue to shrug off the millions that are falling
through the cracks of the "system" and think nothing of it?

If the rave generation is truly to be about more than getting high and
creating an artificial membrane that separates us from the harsh realities of
society, then the age of personal responsibility and mass activism is going
to need to kick in.

The 80's were about building a castle so high that the "undesirables"
couldn't possibly get in.  We have already seen the viability of that grand
solution in the crumbling infra-structure of our society in the 90's.

Let's face it, our educational system is virtually broke, the streets are no
longer safe (even in the "good" neighborhoods) and there are huge segments of
the population that have given up hope.

I will never forget the quote I read in a story last year about the Rodney
King riots, "FEAR FOR THE SOCIETY THAT CREATES A GENERATION WHO FEEL THEY
HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE."

How far are we from realizing those prophetic words?  

This isn't intended as a doom and gloom piece.  Far from it.  I believe
passionately in tomorrow.  But, I also know that realizing the dream of
seeing the barriers that divide humanity come down will come at a cost, and
that cost is personal responsibility and a commitment to making a difference
in the world around us.  

We have got to learn to think beyond the zero-sum game mentality.

What will it take for our culture to personally commit to turning the dark
tide back and how can we make it happen sooner rather than later?  

I'm willing to commit my soul to making a difference.  Are you?  

One person.  One soul.  

Because change starts at the bottom not the top.  Any insight is appreciated.

I am definitely in agreement.  There are thousands of missing kids out
there, but the Polly Klass case became world news because "it
shouldn't have happened in OUR town."  I know I'm not the only one who
feels it was perhaps oversignified (at the risk of sounding heartless)
- it was great that the publicity meant that the (ALLEGED) murderer
was caught and the case more or less solved, but it's not a pretty 
indication of what modern society has become, when it seems that the only
way social problems are solved is when it becomes a major media event.

Actually, I feel a little different.  For me, raves are like the unintended
offspring of the self-actualization movement.  Many of us were raised by
parents who encouraged us to "follow our dreams" - and yet we were confronted
by images of darkness and gloom about our future, told it was a hard road
that lay ahead.  There seemed to be a contradiction between our dreams and
beliefs in ourselves and our generation, and what we saw around us.

Raves, all night parties, getting high with a group of friends - this
became the real-world implementation of Hakim Bey's Temporary Autonomous
Zones, where there were no outside rules, no outside forces, where the
pressures and negative forces placed upon us "from above" were lifted and
we were free to experiment and play and dance and celebrate life.  They
were OUR creation - something that only existed for us because of our 
volunteer participation in them.  And what were the fruits of our labors?
Making people happy.  Isn't that the end goal in life?  Isn't everything
tied to making ourselves happy in one way or another?

I obviously do not mean to speak for everyone about "what raves mean to
me".  I'm trying to look at this from a sociological perspective, but
I do realize there is a myriad of reasons why people go out to parties.
But no matter what their original intent was, their act of participation
alone is sometimes enough to create a real, living TAZ.  

Now for the social change bit.  What do ravers do during the day?  We
obviously aren't dancing and TAZzing 24/7.  We re-enter the common day
world, back to our jobs, or school, or whatever.  But somehow, we are
different.  We've experienced an act of creation, a partial
realization, or even just a vivid visualization, of that "dream" we
have had imbued within us but never thought possible.  Some people are
able to completely divorce their sentiments and enjoyment at raves
with their real work; but most people it seems are greatly affected by
their experiences, and bring that with them into the "real" world.

These translations of experiences into behaivoral changes is a very
personal thing; but certain trends are evident, trends often
identified as "rave ideals".  These ideals we sprinkled upon most of
us by our parents half-heartedly and praised as some sort of goal for
society ("Visualize World Peace" "Take a bit out of Crime").  But some
people have never even experienced real unabashed generosity until a
stranger walked up to them at 5am at a rave and asked, "would you like
a sip of water?".  Never underestimate the power of those words,
because the underlying sentiments behind that action are the kind of
sentiments which will find lost children of the world, which will wipe
out homelessness, which will feed the hungry, and educate the
narramines.

This sort of social change is thus not organized at all, but entirely
resides within the individual.  A decade of unchecked greed and fear
of the future has been brought to a screeching halt, for the sum total
of these changes is the real social change.

Good news is, these sentiments are contagious.

Thomas Jefferson wrote, "In order for a democracy to survive its
participants must actively care for one another."

Exactly.  Join Amnesty international.  Send money to Foods not Bombs.
Participate in protest rallies.  But for me the "rave scene" will 
always be about self-actualization, about teaching people it's OK to
come out of your shells and fight for what you believe in, to respect
one another and be an active participate in the various levels of
community we live in.

} What will it take for our culture to personally commit to turning the dark

Legalizing drugs for a start.  As a matter of fact, my primary
motivation for replying in the first place was that according to CNN
Clinton's surgeon general made a comment today in favor of full
legalization.  Of course, Clinton and Gore piped up and said she was
not speaking for the Administration, but the memes are being planted
folks.  We have a long way to go but we're getting there.

Hell, even I had to fight back a tear!

Congratulations to them both, and I wish them the very best :):):):):)

P.S.  You had to be there:  Preston wore a crushed purlple velvet suit with
a gold shirt, black and green kangol, gold pumas with purple laces.  Sharon
wore a crushed green velvet dress.  Hair UP, with a plethora of flowers in
it.  Looking as beatiful as ever, and green pumas.

They jumped a broom (African Tradition), and crushed glasses (Jewish Tradition).
Mazeltov!

Very, very, very cool!

Nope I did not forget about the Viet Nam war.  Most of thepeople who went
were poor whites and minorities.  The middle class whites (read "hippies")
were too busy protesting not only the war, but the soldiers who had NO
OTHER CHOICE than to serve.  This is not too say that some were not
sincere, and really tried to do something about the war.  The fact is the
middle/upper midlee/upper class who stayed behind had PLENTY of time to
take action.  The war, and the resulting protests was a mixed bag.  Not all
bad, and certainly not all good.

As for segregation, that was another mixed bag.  You certainly did not hear
any hippies or those of the "leisure class" saying that they wanted to move
or go to school in the inner city, no.  The great "experiment" there was to
move minorities OUT of their neighborhoods into the "better" white ones for
an education.  That was de-segregation, and was executed quite poorly IMO. 
Instead of taking those people who took flight out of the city (read
"middle class whites") and reintegrate them into the system they abandoned.
 The victory flag should NEVER be raised when it comes to the benfits that
de-seg have cuased.  The jusry is STILL out on this one.

Close mindedness and bigorty?  Still here and stronger than ever.  You
would think that after such a mass movememtn that people would not want to
go back.  But this certain "hippie" class was all to ready to vote Raygun
into office.  Effectively turning back the clock on ANY gains made.  Racism
is up.  Intolerance is up.  And America has never been a bastion of free
thought, so much for open mindedness.  The fact that some free pockets
exists is not enough to change the psyche of a nation.  IF it were, we
would not be in the social mess we are in now.  Close mindedness is rampant
in the current PC dialectic being proposed (but we all know that PC is a
constantly changing term).

As for whites being dissed for those whites in power...well SOMEBODY voted
these jerks in.  And it sure as hell was not the underrepresented.  SO it
looks like the more lucid thinkers are a minority themselves.  This will
change as the nations, for lack of a better word, complexion changes. 
There is a season....

I do think tho that there are some who hold the idea of
brotherhood/togetherness/etc. And I do not think that every middle class
white person is evil, or self-serving.  I think that people are slowly
changing, again.  But this HYPE about how much the hippies did, and how
much they changed society was just that, hyoe.  To me hippies most hippies
exhibited the same sexism/racism/whateverism that there parents aspoused. 
The only difference is that they hung around a FEW people of color, but
their attitudes changed very little.  That free love crap was just another
reason for SOME GUY to get laid, since women were usually in the position
of giver (sound familiar?).  Not exaclty empowerment was it.

In any case I think the 60's/hippies/movements were a mixed bag with mixed
results.  And with todays typical American (15 min TV memory), it will be
difficult to make any long term changes for the good of society.  Too bad
the peopel who invented all of the TV dribble were the great "hippies" of
the past.  Most who were not co-opted into the "system" are either in jail,
on the streets, or dead.


Peace,
John

APPLE COMPUTER Gets Texas Tax Help Despite Benefit Policy

  GEORGETOWN, Texas -AP- Williamson County commissioners reversed themselves
today, approving a modified financial incentive package for APPLE COMPUTER Inc.
(AAPL) despite the company's policy of giving health benefits the the partners
of gay employees.

  County commissioners voted 3-2 to grant Apple some reimbursements on taxes in
exchange for free right-of-way on future county improvements. The savings would
help pay for a planned $80 million customer service center that would
eventually
employ 1,700 people.

  The vote reversed a 3-2 decision last week rejecting a $750,000 tax abatement
for Apple. In the earlier vote, commissioners said they opposed the abatements
because the computer giant provides health benefits to the domestic partners of
its gay and lesbian employees.

  Commissioner David Hays was the one who switched his vote today.
However, in a
statement he said his vote did not represent a switch in his principles.

  ''Last week I was asked to vote to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize, and
therefore, tacitly endorse a benefits policy with which I disagree.
Today's vote
does nothing of the kind,'' he said.

  The new deal offers Apple tax reimbursements, the total of which will
be about
the $750,000 Apple had sought in tax abatements. The difference is that the
amount would be paid by Apple, then reimbursed back; an abatement would be a
reduction in taxes paid in the first place.

  The new agreement also provides that Apple will grant the county the right of
way for any roads or other improvements the county may want to build on
the site
in the future.

  Lisa Byrne, a spokeswoman for Apple, said the company was pleased with the
pact.

  Williamson County, just north of Austin, includes some Austin suburbs and
other smaller towns. The Apple customer service center is to be opened in 1995
on land in the southern part of the county.

Here's the details:

The Williamson Country Commissioners voted 3-2 against giving Apple a
tax break for opening a new plant. The three that voted against it
claimed they didn't want to subsidize "immoral" behavior as Apple pays
benefits to live-in partners regardless of sexual orientation.

The Texas Republican Party, demonstrating that its ideas haven't
improved since the 18th century, released an official statement
applauding the Williamson County Commissioners for "standing up for
their values".

Texas tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen. Hallelujah!

This idea was offered up on seraves a few weeks ago.  After 
several days of discussion they came to the conclusion that all the 
rave lists should have train parties to some small hick town in 
the middle of America, then have big CyberTribe ( or neTClan if you 
prefer) rave.  It would be a great if it ever happened.

And hopefully in the next local election the indys and demos will pick
up the ball and castigate the repubs as enemies of free enterprise by
denying apple their tax break (and denying the area all those jobs, etc...)

Well John, I can see that you and I just plain disagree and we both have the
same pretty accurate data.  It's just different views.  The only thing that
I think you are factualy wroong about (rather than wrongly opinoned |-) is
that you seem to think that the whole generation of that era were hippies
and everything that has happened since than and up until now including the
reagan/bush years was caused by hippies.  That wasn't the case.  Like I said
before, just because someone dressed like a hippy or incorporated SOME of
the values (but not neccesarily the important ones) or went to Woodstock
doesn't mean they were a hippy.  If all of that generation would have caught
on, the movement would have COMPLETELY SUCCEEDED.  As for people of color,
it's not that they were excluded, they alienated themselves because they
identified less with white long-hairs on acid than those people did with
them.  Everyone was welcome to join, it wasn't an exclusive club.  Anyone
not involved made the choice (a bad one if ya ask me).  

As for your thinking that PC thinkers are close-minded, sure, close-minded
in that they won't consider that racism and sexism might be valid viewpoints.

And another thing.  Hippy chicks slept with (or didn't) with who ever the fuck
they wanted.  If you ask one I'm sure she'll tell you they were exercising
their rights as woman and sexual beings.  They were in control.  It wasn't 
as you say:

 That free love crap was just another
reason for SOME GUY to get laid, since women were usually in the position
of giver (sound familiar?).  Not exaclty empowerment was it.

Anyway John as much as you annoy me sometimes I do appreciate your cycnisism
(sp?).  It just goes to show how people with similar life experiences can
have such different viewpoints about the same issues.

y'all,

i'm no longer on the list, but some of the recent letters on political
activism and the rave scene were forwarded to me. my 2cents:

political activism (or political 'consciousness') requires two things:
first you need accurate information on what's goin on, and analyses that
are consistent with or make sense out of that information.  Secondly,
you need a sense of empathy for your fellow human being.  This second
quality was stressed by Gandhi, M.L.King, the 14th Dalai Lama, and other
activists.  also maybe Jesus in his role as political agitator.  I think
that raves help with the second requirement, but not so much with the
first.  the reason for this is pretty obvious.  loud kickass all night
dance parties are great for connecting with other people but not
particularly well-suited to the dissemination of factual information or
analysis.  conversely, written communication is not very well-suited to
'explaining' empathy.  in fact empathy is virtually unexplainable-- as
so many people have noted, in diverse ways, it is something you just
have to 'feel', and the rave scene has helped a lot of people to open or
reopen their hearts.  I really hope that people act on that new
'opening' politically, but personally it doesnt matter to me whether
they do so within the context of the rave scene or in some other context
like a political organization. it may be more practical to act on it
somewhere quieter!

I disagree.   Your premise presupposes no afterlife, hence no eternity of
soul.  I personally feel there is an afterlife; my proof lies in those 
people who have died on the operating table and who have all reported
out-of-body experiences.  Don't tell me they were dreaming; you can't
dream if you are dead.

Rather, self-sacrifice results from government, religion, and morals.

But everyone is screaming and no one is listening.  There is an etiquette
to expressing one's opinion which does not provoke hostility in others (ie
flaming).  Nothing personal, but I feel certain members on this list lack
good interpersonal skills.  I agree that we can disagree, but let's
respect each other's opinions.

Unfortunately, it's not. I think CA has some sort of law against
discrimination, but I'm not sure. It has to be done at the state
level. CO passed a law (or was it an amendment to the state
constitution?) forbidding any laws to prevent discrimination by sexual
orientation. There have been attempts to do something at a federal
level, but they have been shot down pretty quickly by you know who.

I'm *very* glad we're free to be bigots and assholes and gay bashers
and whatever. Without the choice, the decision to be kind and tolerant
is meaningless. You can't legislate away hatred. It's got to run its
course, and we need to grow up, and only then will we really be
healed.

At the same time, I *don't* think the government should be in the
business of discriminating against anybody for any reason. The penalty
for failing the public trust should be swift, and extreme.

And while we're on political soapboxes, why do prosecutors get to
spend millions of dollars to prosecute, but public defenders don't get
to spend millions of dollars to defend? It seems to me the defender
should have access to a budget as large, or larger. 

See you tonight at YSH :)

Be glad you guys don't live here in North Carolina where only missionary
style sex between two heterosexuals is legal.  The sad thing is that it
doesn't have to be consensual in a case of husband and wife (IE a man can
legally rape his wife).  Thank-You Jesse Helms for contributing to backass
backwoods beliefs.  (P.S. Robert Mapplethorpe's works are also banned here.)

Yep.... Actually, thinking about it, the situation isn't much better
here, either...  Discrimination on the grounds of race or gender is
illegal, but not (as far as I'm aware) sexuality....  I was just
rather shocked by the idea of state sponsored discrimation against
those who refused to discriminate... I've never heard of anything
quite so bad over here....

That ain't proof!

How dead is dead? Are neurons in the brain still firing? Even just a
few? Are any of the biological activities that we think of as "life" still
occuring (skin cells regenrating, nails and hair still growing)?

Perhaps these "near death" experiences are just a hallucination people
go through as their brains twinkle into nothingness.  Perhaps people
born into other cultures that haven't been poisoned by Judeo/Christian
lies will have other kinds of near death hallucinations -- animist,
buddhist, rastafarian, or whatever. And perhaps it's just a big
endorphin trip to cover up the pain and anguish of dieing?

Are any of my hypotheses any more or less valid than your "proof"? If
so, then I'd rather not make any judgements about what is and what
isn't the reality of life and afterlife. And we can make even fewer
inquiries into reality based on people's subjective experiences of it.
The mind's perception of "reality" is an infinitely malleable thing;
people always strive for a "belief completeness" that synergizes their
beliefs and their experiences into a reality that may very well not be
there.

All this "near death" crap about seeing a tunnel of light and all that
B.S. really doesn't mean shit to anybody other than the person that
hallucinated it. It is equally (un)important to pay credence to the
psychotic visions of a lunatic, or the yammerings of someone on acid
"seeing god." ...

How about 28 minutes dead.  If the spirit disappeared into nothingness
it would not have been able to revive since there would be nothing to revive.

You are resorting to insult which does not follow a logical course (or
promote your cause).  However, I will rise above it and respond.  How come
there has been no documentation of these "other dreams"?  Because there are
none that challenge the current ones.  We do, however, have documentation
concerning life on other planets from other countries so we have access to
these hypothetical "other dreams" if they were to occur.  So far they
haven't.

This is psychology and does not refute the existence of God or the
spirit world.

Your subjective experience and opinion which you are entitled to.  Lots of 
people outside your realm of knowledge, howver, find significance to it.  I
for one, do.  (P.S. You are not God, your opinion only holds true within

I disagree.   Your premise presupposes no afterlife, hence no eternity of

people who have died on the operating table and who have all reported
out-of-body experiences.  Don't tell me they were dreaming; you can't
dream if you are dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's not proof!  And I won't tell you they were dreaming.  I have had a
drug-induced out-of-body experience and it was VERY REAL.  It is very common
to have out-of-body experiences during operations whether you had the
misfortune of dying or not.  Can these people prove that the experience was
during as oposed to just before or after the death part?  Besides, maybe 
there's just a few minutes lag time from when your body dies until your
conciesnous floates out of your body and evaporates into the great Tao.
Kinda like when you turn off an amp but music still plays until the electricity
cycles through for a couple seconds.  I don't know, who does?

I expect the combined Groove Kitchen/Wicked/Basics party this weekend
to to be jam-packed and jammin', with maybe more people than you've
ever seen in 1015 Folsom.  That same night, Elmo is throwing a party
which should be more intimate.

On Sunday, Liquid Air returns with a fresh DJ lineup - it may be at
the Third Wave again, but check the info line on Sunday.  Also, Boogie
Buffet will be wrapping up soon, you may want to check it out while 
you can.

Funky Tekno Tribe may be sponsoring a park party soon, call 266.8215 for
more info.

And rumors of the death of Deep Space were greatly exaggerated.  It's
moving to a new location.  Anyone know where yet?

new - dorothy's tribe, spacelab (tonight), colors
not - housing project? - seems like dorothy's tribe is replacing it on sat.

Implicit in this statement is an assumption that there *is* a reality
beyond our subjective experience of it.  This in itself is just a
belief.  What is a fact is everything you know is already inside your
mind.  If reality is totally subjective, than so is the concept of death.  
Niels, I don't know what your criteria of "proof" for an afterlife
is, since you might even be inclined to explain a supernatural experience
of your own as the "psychotic visions of a lunatic". 

There are scientists who are starting to apply Quantum Physics to 
consciousness.  A mind that takes on certain characteristics, like being 
reduced to some kind of tightly looped selfreferential focal point, might 
be expected to exhibit quantum wave phenomena resulting from a kind of 
consciousness uncertainty principle.  How such a thing is experienced 
might involve a wave pattern of consciousness that extends beyond the 
usual limits of everyday awareness.  It can also be theorized the entire
Universe I find myself in is nothing more than the conscious quantum 
mechanical wave pattern of my actual nonexistence.

of some ravers.  Personally, I think that some of the time warping and 
other mind bending things experienced while trancing out to the beat hold 
some clues to the kinds of theories that I'm touching on.  [Yes, a rave
tie-in!]  Einstein has already "proven" to us that there is no absolute 
point of reference for time, even though we all mutually agree to keep our 
watches in sync.  In a Universe with no absolutes, what we believe just
might be a better definition for reality than any other.

Too bad more of you couldn't make it to lunch.  We'll try again next Thursday
same directions unless someone else wants to host it this time.  Michael W.
and my housemates and a couple of friends had a mellow/good time and than
later Franklin (Minor Minor of KALX) dropped by to chat and deliver the 
Exist Dance compilation disk that I won Sat night (Thanks!).

We were hoping to meet some new faces and see some old ones.  This is a bad
time of year though.  Maybe theres enough advanced notice this time for more
people to be able to make it.

count on me.. sexual sexual deviant.."

I think  that is enough of a sample:). If you see it on vinyl or tell me

OK.  I've been able to handle this discussion up until now.  Please
take it to private email.

(and no need to send "me too" posts to sfraves, that just negates the
whole point of asking them to take it to private email.)

While a very interesting topic, the concept of life after death and
the religious implications thereof has very little to do with raving.
I have no problem reading the first few posts, it was interesting, but
things have devolved.

And if you think I should go soak my head, send me private email.  :-)

Tell me Tanya, does that take into account *assumptions* that people have never

Frankly this list could use a healthy dose of cynicism every once in a while.

When I was on my way to Amsterdam last March, KLM's in-flight magazine
had a short blurb on a party train between Belgium and Amsterdam, once
a month.  Apparently it was organized by one of the discos (Club It, I
think) and provided round trip service, dancing all the way!  I think
they had organized it as a single car on a regular train...

Patience, Bob, patience.  We were just getting to the really important
questions:
Will there be raves in the afterlife? 
Will I need a sound permit to throw one?
Will I have to wait for God's Personal DJ to die first?

Yes, and the beaurocracy will be of staggering (Biblical?) proportions.

I AM SO HAPPY.

Note to Technopolis people:  I am trying to work it so I will still

believe me I will leave the coordination in very good hands.  I will
also leave the daily administration of the list in very good hands,

I've secured the following music videos on NTSC for my music video show FLUX,
which airs on cable in San Diego. January 1st I'm moving to San Francisco and
hopefully can secure airtime for the show up there as well. As for LA - I
guess CRAVE beat me to the punch.

Bjork "Big Time Sensuality" - One of the more-house tracks from her record.
Very sexy Bjork on the back of a flat bed driving through the streets of New
York. Will most likely appear on MTV.

Psykosonik "Welcome to My Mind" - IMO EMFish sounding track, but this is a
pretty incredible video produced by H-GUN labs (creators of early NIN videos
among others).

Aphex Twin "ON" Imagine Bonny Dunes beach (FMR) with crazy Peter Gabrielish
stop motion objects and figures (Is that a cardboard  cutout of Richard
James?). Cool.

Future Sound of London "Cascade" - Tunneling sensual computer graphics
effects with an animated multi-limb chrome blob from the cover of the EP.

We are currently putting together a special episdoe of Flux that will feature
interviews with Moby, Orbital, Aphex Twin, and Vapourspace from the Los
Angeles date, live outakes from the SF show (courtesy Lisa B) and music
videos ("GO," Next is the E," "Move," "Speed Freak," "Halcyon," "On," and
"The Gravitational Arch of 10." (!!!!!!) Still trying to get a copy of
Orbital's "Lush," but apparently the US FFRR hates the video and doesn't want
to service it (the video is two woman at a swap meet or something).

Status: 

First, a warning: this is a blatant plug.  However, i hope it's
a tasteful blatant plug.  And, since so many SFRavers were involved,
it seems appropriate.

The Fluid Groove posse proudly announces the availability of 
a double cassette set of four of the best sets from the Fluid
Groove and Liquid Air parties from September through November 93.

Featured DJs are SFRaves own Jon Drukman, Lee An, Laura, and Tamara.
Each DJ set is 45 minutes, for a total of 3 hours of music.  SFRs
Bob Ramstad and Brian Behlendorf provided the DATs, and Bob mastered
the tapes. SFRs Ethan Miller of nrgdesign did the Jcards. A set of
quality tapes for discriminating ears.

These tape sets will be available for sale at this Sunday afternoon's
Liquid Air (which is now a Release Party, in addition to being an 
already great time).  The price is $10 for the set.

If you can't make it to the party, and would like to mailorder them,
contact Bob Ramstad.  His email address is boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com

Many thanks to you all for your continued support of Liquid Air, and
to the other DJs who we didn't have room for: SLiP, XDZebra, Chris,
Timothy, and Ethan.

Status: 

First: thanks to everyone who came to today's Liquid Air.  Thanks to 
all the DJs for putting in great sets: Kenneth Paul, Doran, Susan, and
Joe Rice.  Many thanks to Ethan for Sound Vision, and to Sean for his
help loading, unloading, setting up, watching the door, etc., and to Bob
Ramstad for DATing both rooms, watching the door, helping setup and tear
down, etc.  Truly groovy party. I really appreciate all their efforts.

But (and a big BUT)

YOU WEREN'T THERE!

This is the fifth party I've thrown, and Ethan has done two.  We haven't
broken even, and, in a lot of ways, the parties have never really gone off.
Also, coincidentally, I've sunk a lot of money and time into throwing these
parties, and a lot of other people have given their time as well.

It just isn't happening.

Now, you may be thinking that I'm just a pissed off organizer on a bender
after a disappointing party.  I'm not.  I really just want these things to
go off, and for people to have a good time.  I've done my part: provided
quality spaces, quality DJs, quality prices, quality sound, quality every
little detail.

Starry eyed me.  I guess I thought "throw a good party and they will come."
Duh, me.

Time and time again, I have heard, "well, everyone went to Wicked/Basics/
Groove Kitchen/Funky Tekno Tribe..." and they're really spun.  Or, "it's
not that kind of crowd." Or, "the kind of people who go to massives don't
go to minors." Or, "nobody comes out for non-name DJs." Or...

Well, that's a load of crap.  People just aren't coming.  I promoted this 
one the hardest I've ever promoted any party.  I know other people who
throw parties who have promoted very hard and had very few people show up,
even with name DJs, despite no other major events.  I've personally experienced
ripoff artists gathering up major money and splitting without throwing an
event.  I've seen renegade massives that go for 1.5 hours and be busted by
cops in riot gear and yet people will go to the next one those self-same
fuck-ups put on.  People go for that shit every time, in big ways. 

Ethan and I have put on 7 parties.  Every single one has gone off, within
1/2 hour of the predicted start time.  We have thrown free and low cost
events.  We have had list and major DJs.  We have opened up the events
to non-name talent.  We have provided the highest quality, best tuned
sound of any event I've ever been to.  We've never been busted (though
we did have to move ONE time). We've never had a fight.  We've never
had a fire.  We've always had free water.  We've always had plenty of
ventilation.  We've always had great locations.  We've always had a good
vibe running. We've always run 18+ or all ages events. We've always
supported the other posses.  

And, before you hit the "r" key too quickly: I'm not interested in your
excuses.  What counts is what you do.  Ethan and I and others have DONE
parties.  We've made the time/space/music/dance continuum open up for
you.

My question to you is: are you going to support your own House?

And, again, before you hit that "r" key, I already have my answer.

Come out east.  We NEED people like you.  Okay, the scene out here isn't 
as live as the one SF gets to complain about, but we are growing and it 
is beautiful.  I know this probably wont happen, that you live in SF and 
aren't really into coming out here to do a party.  But I would like to 
introduce the idea.  While we have some great promoters out here we still
appreciate new ones.  We get tired of the same old promoters, building up 
power structures and ungerground hierarchies.  Fresh blood (pardon my 
vampiric tendencies) is necessary, and it is a whole new market for you.
Okay, maybe we are a bit harder, musically; less house, more gabba and 
darkness, but the PLUR principles are still in effect.  Maybe I am getting 
tired of the same old east coast folk throwing parties.  But I would 
really like to see some of you all come on out here.

> My question to you is: are you going to support your own House?

Yep.  I already do.  And now I am going to be coming out to support yours 
too.  Hey all, this is Dan, from DC (NE Raves listadmin, vrave addikt, 
etc.).  I am going to be coming out to California for a little while, and 
would love to meet up and dance with you all.  I should be in SF after 
the 28th for a few days, so if you have any suggestions as to what I can 
do to hook up with you all, give me a mail back at the 
anarchy@eng.umd.edu address.  And for all my SF friends from my last trip 
to Mecca, let's get together.

It takes MORE than 5 parties to break even.  TRUTH of the trade.

[deleted for brevity so I can get long winded :) ]

I have done my share of parties.  I have worked with the biggest and the
best in SF/LA.  In some cases, even before they were the biggest and the
best.

There are sooo many variables to throwing a party.  My last party flopped,
that would be flop #2 for me.  The others I have thrown have gone off quite
well.  But I have YET to see any profit.  Am I doing something wrong, I
DOUBT it.  What I have learned is it is the little things that can
make/break a party.  The last one (dB) is a perfect example.  That party
had the names, and enough promotion to make sure we broke even.  The vox
mail message, stating that there was a limit to the people allwed to enter,
killed us.  That simple (this was a condition of the lease, and since I am
an HONEST promoter I honored that condition.  That condition killed us!).

As much as you want to beleive that  you did enough promotion, you probably
did not.  It is not enough to hand out flyers.  It is not enough to put
flyers in stores, it is not enough to put it on the list.  IT is important
to build excitement about what you do to those who are the
pullers/shakers/party-goers in our community.  You have to go face to face
and TALK to 300 people to get them there.  And I mean talk to them,
converse with them, tell them what's up, and pass YOUR excitement onto
them.  Anything less is DOOMED to failure.  SO if you PROMOTE by not only
flyering [??], but talking to people, they WILL come.  dB had EVERYONE I
invited come [btw, thanx for coming] (we were to invite 25 paying each.
Mine came, the DJ's people did not.  I promoted, they did not, we got sunk,
plain and simple).

You are dealing with a crowd who has seen it all by now.  Although it is
great that you had the fucking guts to book new talent, you have to have a
damn good mix of old school to bring a crowd in.  Putting all new DJ's on
flyers, who have not played the , for lack of a better word, major parties,
will not do you any good.  I have always tried to put 1 (no more than that)
new DJ on the tables.  But I keep it to that number, and try to work with
that DJ to help him/her build a rep so that they can bring a draw for me.
One other dynamic has changed.  What in the hell are YOU doing promoting,
when EVERYONE INVOLVED with you should be doing likewise.  This includes
the DJ's.  DJ's are the laziest when it comes to this.  But they must get
involved as well to ensure the party's success (I mean, it is their party
as well, non?).  Hell if a DJ won't even brag about where he's playing, and
how amped up he is for it, then why the fuck should I go and hear him spin.
IF he/she can't do that then why should I go?  Everyone should be a
partner in the enterprise, anything less is energy goin to waste.

The other crucial element is timing.  Right now is not a good time to throw
a party unless you are a big name.  Even the Wicked boys are having a hard
time drawing so...

Please remember, you do the party to impress yourself.  If you've done the
best to provide the proper environ, done your PERSONAL promotion, and have
done things true to you, and people won't come,consider it a lesson learned
and move on (either to do another, or do something else).

I dunno Bryce...I dunno if what I've said helped or hurt.  I guess they are
my observations of my own failings.  I am sorry I did not come, but I don't
do Sunday Night things, or Thursday Night stuff (btw, I go to MOTION
because I work in South SJ.  I stay down there, see my cracker-jack pals,
and hang out until 12 then head home.  The DJ's are always pumped and I
know I'll have a good time with many friends.  The city is less hospitalble
unless my whole cadre of friends is hangin').

Never depend upon people support unless you've personally invited them.  I
do not go to parties unless I am invited.  A flyer don't cut it anymore.
If you're doing a party, and you know who I am, then I do not see why you
can't spend 3 minutes inviting me to come.  The more personal the better,
and I always bring paying friends (Hell, I LOVE to support my comrades in
arms, so I usually pay for my guests.  And I ain't rich).

I hope that you take some time off, cool down for the holidays, and
re-consider what you'd like to do.  The one thing that guarantees success
is perseverance.  That is why Preston is #1.  He's been doing this forever.
That's why Wicked, FMM, Basics/Martin's gigs go off.  They just keep going
until they get it right, and don't stop even when they do.  That is what
seperates the good promos from the best.  To say the least, I do not
consider myself the best, but I do know how the best became what they are.
They never quit.  I hope you don't either.  You got a story to tell, and a
medium to do it.  Keep the faith, and fuck anybody who does not appreciate
what you do.  After a while you'll get what rightfully deserve :) :) :)

Peace,
John

	Bryce, I second everything Dan said and more. You Bay Area
folk have no idea how jealous I am of your scene. Very little happens
here in Missoula, Montana, which isn't particularly surprising, but
not a whole lot more happens in Portland, which is surprising, and
disappointing as well. Portland also has a problem with a tiny little
clique running the scene.
	If I lived in SF I'd probably be a street person between
supporting my music habit and raving. Raves in the middle of the week!
Jeno! Garth! Carlos! Spun! ARRRGH!
	So, in short, _I'd_ be at your events if I could, but like Dan
said, the commute is a bitch. :) I'd MUCH rather go to an event where
I know the DJs and the crowd and knew that it was going to be small
and friendly than go to a big huge mega party where everybody and
their dog and Doc Martin too was spinning.

yrz in support,

Well, I am truly disappointed that people did not show up to Liquid Air on
Sunday. I really don't understand that, beyond mitigating circumstances which
naturally turn up now and then (being really tired, having to work, finals,
whatever), relatively few people are supporting these parties on a consistent
basis.  This list is always full of complaints about things going wrong at
parties, and Bryce et al have worked very hard to try and present an 
alternative to the big parties by throwing events that don't have any of those
problems and honestly come from the heart.  I can understand the differences
between big and small parties and I can understand why some people choose the
Wickeds and the Basics over everything else, but what I cannot understand is
how some people on this list can consistently bitch about horrible things 
happening at the big events and then continuing to support said events with
their hard-earned dollars without so much as complaining or making suggestions
on those promoters' voice mail boxes. I am obviously biased about Bryce's 
parties since he has given me a chance to spin at them and be a part of them,
but even if I wasn't so deeply involved I would be upset because it just seems
like hypocrisy to me.

If bad things happen at a Basics (for example) that you think could be better
improved on the next party with effort on the part of the promoter, let them
know that. You deserve to get the best that your money can by and if you let 
upsetting things go without comment then they are likely to continue.

I am very interested to see where this thread will go. Thank you for indulging
me this message. It is probably the only time I have ever ranted and gotten up
on my little soapbox yet on this list.

(But I'm only doing it 'cuz I care about you having good experiences at these
parties!)

If everyone has forgiven me for my last message, I now want to say that I will
be spinning at Your Sister's House tentatively on December 23rd (with Dani and
Jan Cooley) and on January 6th (with Susan and possibly DRC). One of the main
reasons that I like to spin so much is that I get to share the music I love
with my friends so I hope to see you there. :)

	As I think of the reasons that Bryce, tamara, et al. expound on.
	I must look at MY reasons for not attending liquid air.  I have
	wanted to attend a Liquid Air event but they always seem to be
	at a time that I just can't fit in.  These days, I no longer have
	the liberty of being a "full time raver" having a "part time" job.
	I'm working a 60 hour week 6 days a week, I get one day off and if
	I go out the night before, I need that day to rest and recover.

	What I will say from helping other people put on parties, is that
	you can NEVER promote your party too much,  It's not enough to
	just promote it on the list, the list has a relatively high return
	for the investment but there are only 250 or so people on the list,
	if 10% of them come (a sizeable result for posting an e-mail message)
	that is 25 people.  In all of my partying, I have seen ONE liquid Air
	flyer.  I realize that you are trying to create a positive athmosphere
	and you don't want to print 10,000  2ft by 3ft color flyers like 
	Cool World, but if you want liquid air to be successful, you have to
	send people out to other parties and flyer for liquid air.  If you give
	me flyers, I will pass them out, I promise you.

Me being new to the scene and all, I doubt I can contribute much to
the analysis.

But I would like to thank Bryce and Ethan and Bob for working so hard
to put it together, for showing such a positive attitude, and for
trying to *do* something rather than just talk about it. That's why I
support them, because what they're about is something I can really
believe in.

The environment was good, and the music was even better. The DJs put
in astoundingly good sets. I'd never heard Duran spin before, and I
was impressed. And Susan... I don't know what to say... all I could do
is sit on the floor with my jaw open. The depth of her stuff continues
to amaze me. I think that she and Markie have a lot in common that
they're way out there doing their own thing, and it sounds just
incredible.

I hope smaller parties like this can be made to work, because they're
very dear to my heart. And I hope what JSL said about having to have
lots of name DJs isn't true.  Most of the name DJs bore me (sorry). I
wanna dance!

This is very true.  The only thing you couldn't provide is a guaruntee of
a pumped up jammin' crowd.  It's a catch 22 situation that's very difficult 
to overcome: people won't go to a party if they fear that not enough people 
will go to the party.  Every month, there are a lot of good parties to choose 
from, each with it's own flavor.  Even your most dedicated friends will only 
show up to yours a fraction of the time.  The core of the SF House scene 
(people who go out on a very regular basis) just really isn't that large.   

>Starry eyed me.  I guess I thought "throw a good party and they will come."

I think a year or two ago this might have been enough.  People I know who 
used to go to out every weekend now seem to be passing up even on parties 
that they think will be good.  Connection Earth, was free, in beautiful
GG Park, and featured a top name DJ.  I did a limited amount of flyering 
and was afraid that 300-500 people would overrun the place via word of mouth.  
100 people showed up for a wonderful time, and I learned something: there just
aren't alot of people chomping at the bit for clues on where the "special"
kinds of parties are.  People aren't as motivated as they used to be to go 
out hunting for the best place to expend a weekend's worth of energy.  I know 
that I've  been finding it difficult to conjure up the energy week after 
week.   

John S. Lee:

I think JSL has hit the nail on the head.  There has to be a sense of
excitement.  It's hard to create that without a track record, but I still
think there are opportunities for throwing *occasional* successful parties 
of an alternative nature.  But there has to be something special 
about them, though; fresh DJs and a caring promoter isn't enough. Try
-exotic location (i.e. Boat, GG Park, rooftop, train, beach)
-spiritual/cosmological connection (i.e. Full moon, religious holidays, 
					new age rituals)
-theme hook (i.e. an afterparty, a benefit, parking lot of GDead show)

Personally, dance parties put on just for the sake of a dance party are 
starting to bore me.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wicked/GrooveKitchen/Basics review:

I thought that this was a mediocre event.  Although the music was good, I 
felt that the energy was scattered and the vibe seemed kinda forced.  
This was a club scene party with a smattering of ravers.  Usually, parties 
like this can get really good after 4, but by 6:30, I felt like I was still 
just making time.  I thought Josh's set was fresh and very psychedelic, and 
Tony kicked ass early when no one was there.  The only other thing of note 
was the light show in the main room; they had this flying saucer light wheel 
that sent out multicolored beams, like giant spokes, spinning and rotating 
all directions.  Pretty, cool, but like the rest of the strobes, lasers, and
intellibeams, it did little to focus people's energy in any special way.  
As for multiple DJ's in different rooms; unless the venue is very large and 
the music in each room is very different, dividing up the crowd and giving 
people an excuse to wander creates a disunifying affect.  

Overall, it was a nice try.  I'm sure a lot of people really enjoyed 
themselves.  The club scene feeling was just too dominant for me, and I
got there way too early.

 Either that, or you have to go head

megapromotion angle, and still be willing to end up losing money.

							Rave report
							===========

YSH - Your Sisters House....   Was at the Upper Room,  one of my favorite
venues (No Smoking).    Darcy spun a totally awsome acid trance set that
really warmed me up.    WOW!  We gotta hear more of this stuff.   

After that,  the music got kinda strange and unpredictable,  so I took
the opportunity to schmoose with my freinds,   then finally left about
5 am or so.


Vibe
====

Thanx to the generious ways of Carlos,  I managed to get on his guest
list and attend "Vibe".   It was at the top floor of DV8 lounge,  a
smallish space,   but with adequate ventilation.   The music was really
good,   with Carlos starting out the set.   The music lasted till about
6 or 6:30,   and by that time,  I was ready to head out for breakfast,
and head for home to check out the Net job listings.


Wickerd/Basics/GK
=================

At 1015 Folsom,  was split into 3 areas,  but the main area,  mostly
dominated by the Wicked crew was really hopping.   Actually,  each
of the 3 areas didn't actually coincide with the 3 rave groups,  as
some were mixed.    There were 2 chill areas (Basement and top
floor).   Ins and outs were allowed up until about 5 am,   then if
anyone wanted to leave,  they would have to pay another $5 for Boogie
Buffet.   For those that wanted to stay,  that was an option,  but they
couldn't get back in,  once they left.    At about 5 am,  they also closed 
the basement area and the front room,   but the music lasted until after
9 am and got really good towards the end.    As usual,  I was dancing like 
a mad-man towards the end.    By that time,  most people left the dance
area,   making more room to move around.    Like Geoff said,  it was
very crowded,  even up till the very end.   I heard a lot of really great
new music this time,  and not that older heavily played stuff.

Boogie Buffet
=============

After the front room, re-opened,  I helped Preston clean up the back area,
then split for an hour or so,  then returned to the usual Boogie Buffet
which didn't seem that crowded.    Later on,  I headed over to Liquid Air,
and was surprised to find nobody there but a few of the SFRavers. 


Liquid Air
==========

I was appalled that the attendance was so poor,  and it was such a beautiful
place,  mirrors around the walls made it seem much larger than it actually
was.     Plenty of room to move around,   very well ventilated,  no smoking
at all.    Duran was spinning a totally awsome trance set,  and I especially
liked the Vangelis song he played.    Susan came on after that,  and spun
an equally trancey set.     I'm really sorry that none of my freinds
from Boogie Buffet came over to Liquid Air,  as I must have told quite a few
people where it was.   Earlier,  I had called the info number to get the details
and gave the location out to everyone I knew.   I think most were totally 
hosed after Wicked,   and by that time,  wanted to go home.

Status: 

I just got back from SF, where I was reminded of why the scene there has
such a good reputation.

Wicked/Basics/GK on Saturday night was what any club should be. It was
obvious the promoters cared about what they were doing and the crowd (800+)
cared about the music. There were 4 different rooms of sound, including an
ambient room, great lighting, and lots of energy. Friendly door people and
free water, too.
The quality of the music was high.  I thought Garth was incredible,
especially when he started mixing some nice acid tunes. So good I stayed 4
hours longer than intended and ended up only getting 2 hours of sleep. (had
to get up to hit Tweekin' records before Liquid Air started =) )

I haven't seen anything like that in LA for awhile, but I have faith that
it'll happen. Doc is likely to start a Saturday thing very soon, and that
should be good, but methinks we need something different than another
club...

It's a shame that Liquid Air was so sparsely attended. I didn't see any
flyers at Wicked - I wish I'd had some to hand out.  I really liked the
space. Too bad it's only usable during the day. The sound in the main room
was quite good - I don't think I've seen Community speakers at a club
before. I spent most of the time in the ambient room (or nap room =) ) so I
didn't get to hear anyone in the main room.  Overall a great effort, and
one worth supporting.

Subject: The Scene Is...
Status: 

Needless to say, I was hurt, disappointed, left disallusioned, pissed off
and otherwise traumatized by the total lack of support for liquid air
sunday.

If everyone on this list doesn't know it already, take note now: 
this party has always been *for you*, for us, for community; our attempt to 
KEEP IT THE FUCK ALIVE. 

Lord knows this scene needs it!

Were we doing it for the money? Get real...
Were we doing it so we could be bigshot promoters? Get real...
Were we doing it because we enjoy carrying 940lbs up and down six flites of
stairs?  Come on...

No, we thought that *together* we could do much better than the parties we
all love to complain about that: cost too much; permanently damage your
hearing, your lungs etc.; that offer you the same djs in the same tired
clubs over and over again...

We thought it meant more; that it wasn't just a dance party for the sake of
a dance party; it was part of the foundation of this community, of this
house, that we all love so much. Afternoons are great: you can see and hear
each other, meet friends and families, and yes, dance together...

To the extent that we on this list do form a community, I really feel like
when someone on this list does something, like a MESS, like a Connections,
like a liquid air, we have an *obligation* to come out and support that
effort, and not just token appearances on the way to Wicked, GK, Blah,
Blah, Blah... I mean real support. You think we don't have: finals, jobs,
families... Do you want this scene alive or not?

If I sound like I'm starting to rant, perhaps it's because I think that so
far the responses to Bryce's post this morning range from frail to weak.
There were a couple of: *you* didn't flier good enough, so *I* didn't comes
(even though I knew about it...); one: I wasn't personally enough invited;
an: I don't do sunday nights (or thursday, or friday, or
saturday...basically any time we've ever done a partys); you haven't paid
your dues yet, lost money for long enough, don't know the right people,
picked the wrong djs; it was too bright, it was too dark, the fan was on
the wrong speed, the water was too cold. 

Bottom line? if we can't count on you, who can we count on?

Alright you get the point. Now on to something positive:

About a year ago, Malachy and some friends threw a party called Atomic
Rooster that I did a flier for and, happily, attended; it was a free party
in the north parking lot of the Oakland coliseum on the last night of a run
of greatful dead shows there. There were two, small, full-range cabinets
sitting on the ground, decks, amps and a crowd of happy people dancing to
Jeno, Garth and Markie. Up to that point, I had really only been to
massives, and I remember dancing that night and thinking: Wow! this is
really all it takes, maybe I should put together a sound system so we can
do more stuff like this...

Anyway, this coming weekend (Sunday the 19th to be specific) presents us
with a return of this great opportunity: tons of free space, lots of people
that want to dance, and a fucking booming sound system. Sound Vision *will*
rock in Oakland this Sunday, and make no mistake, I for one am not going to
be so spun after The Gathering that I miss this opportunity to spread some
vibe, FREE. 

So, I'd like to take this opportunity to personally invite each and
everyone of you, and please, tell some friends, bring some friends: make it
happen. We'll go from 6pm till approx. 2:30 am. DJs e-mail me if you wanna
spin. And oh yeah, I need a couple of reliable volunteers to help me load
and unload about a ton of sound gear, e-mail me if you're interested. We
also need a generator, if anyone has one or would like to make a donation
towards the rental of one, lemme know.

peace
and (to quote M. O'Brien): always, always, always, keep it alive!

Subject: The SCENE & High expectations...
Status: 

I have heard it all now...from both Ethan and Bryce.

I do NOT want to start a flame war, but this pissed off attitude (which is
what it is) has gotten on my last nerve.

Gentlemen,

Stop BLAMING people for your party's failure.  As much as you want to
disbelieve it, YOUR party is ALL YOU!  100%!!!  Not anyone else's.  All
yours.  You own it, you finance it.  It's your brainchild therefore it is
yours!  It is UNFAIR to rail to people on the list for not attending your
party.  You have NO RIGHT whatever to EXPECT ANYTHING from ANYONE!  So get
off of it.  You failed, like I have, like Preston has, like everyone else
has and still does.

You did NOT promote enough, plain and simple.  I RARELY read the rave guide
UNLESS I am doing an event, or one of my friends (who are sometimes
promoters) asks me to read the list.

You guys need to lick your wounds and re-think what the hell you're doing,
and WHY!  Your party is you, and foisting it upon the back of others
expecting some type of support, when you guys did not do enough promo is
bunk.  If I have not heard of your party thru the vine (i.e. voice), then
IMO it ain't goin on, PERIOD.  I depend entirely on word of mouth and
personal invite.  You may not like it but that's how I do it, as well as
many others.  Just another reality of this scene you have got to learn to
deal with, IF you want people to come.

As much as you think your party is recognized, it is not. Not YET that is.
Recognition depends entirely on YOU.  I have YET to meet Ethan, and I just
met Bryce recently.  Bryce attended 2 Vortex's and I met him WAAAAY outside
the party scene.  HE didn't even know who I was, much less myself knowing
him.  ANd therin lies the problem.  You may have TALKED to promoters, but
do you KNOW them?  I doubt it.  There are many reasons, and they are all
VALID IMO, people would/could not come.  For me it was two things.  I did
not know the time it was held (I thought it was at night), and I was not
personally invited.  To both of you guys this is BS, but to me it is real.

I have served my time in the community and spent many years developing
relationships that GUARANTEE a 500-600 turnout at a party that I promote
properly.  You guys look at that and say what you will, the fact is, like
anything else, there are dues to pay, people to know, places to be, etc.
You did not do enough of it obviously.

The next thing is that you had your party up against BB & the night after
BGW.  Now I ask you, if you've been crackin on ALL NIGHT, why leave to
TRAVEL (whilst your high) to a pal's party when you can have a nice time in
the place you've been at all night?  Up against those logisitics I would
have started my party later.  But that is me.

Have you spent enough time fostering relationships with the community so
that you would have a good turnout?  I doubt it.  I made a few calls, and
people have HEARD about Liquid Air (I am talking the circle I hang with),
but do not know the people who are invovled.  And at this juncture THAT is
the most important thing.

Another thing, as much as you want to be "different", people at times want
things they are familiar with.  I RARELY attend Wickeds (since I am not
invited all that often), but am anxious to go to an all nighter just to
hear the boys spin.  I have been listening to them for some time and I KNOW
what they do for me, so I have a better idea what to expect (esp if I get
looped), than going to a party with untried, and unproven DJ's.
Elistist...maybe, I prefer to call it selective.  And I have a right to
choose how I want to spend my time.

I have called Ethan twice, primarily in regards to renting his super sound
system :).  He has all my numbers, and yet I was not aware of the specifics
of his event.  Why?  See this is what I mean, PERSONAL PROMOTION.  You
EXPECT myself and other to read the list (provided by Derek et. al. :) :),
but what if I don't?  The idea is to have no expectations and to leave no
stomed unturned.  Take it from me, I lost enough money to know ;)

As much as you'd like to think otehrwise, you guys are in a VERY
competitive business, and like everything else it requires a certain
understanding of how things are.  I have made public & private invites to
you both to hook up and talk, but you were either too busy, or too whatever
to take me up on it.  Let me tell you something.  This whole scene is about
communication and expansion of the communications web.  SFR has about 250
folx on it, not enough (considering the usual 10% return) to break even.

I was VERY lucky.  I came to SF from LA, made contacts, worked with others,
and as a result got to know alot of people.  Ron Ciron, Preston, & Martin
are personally responsible for any sucesses I have had, and I always give
these guys props!  When I can, I attend Martin's parties.  Same with
Preston and Ron.  If I do not attend their gigs, I call them up to find out
how things went, and let them know that I was sorry I did not come.  No
other explanations needed since we've all known each other for a while.  I
am very real with them, and calling them has nothing to do with an angle.
I just like to show that I think about them, and wish them well in anything
that they do (and I show my support by showing up at as many of their
events as possible.  I feel obligated, especially if I get an PERSONAL
invite)!  That is what relationships, IMO, is all about.  I have extended a
hand to some here, but I guess everyone has thier own way.  No big deal.  I
still wish people the best.  The idea is to keep that PERSONAL touch going,
so that you let people know YOU CARE that they attend your event.

I hate to preach (which is what I am doing), but you guys goin' on and on
about your parties is not fair to those who made a choice and decided not
to come.  I have lost THOUSANDS of dollars doin this stuff, and I RARELY
bitch about people not showing.  dB did not go off because the other 3
parties involved did not promote to their friends (hell, If Markie, James,
Josh cant get 75 people in you KNOW they did not do their part).  We
failed, I was pissed, but not at the community, but at my partners and
myself.  My friends (in force, all 15+25 PAYING people) all came.  I handed
out 3 flyers, and called everyone else.  They all showed up.  Nothing like
the personal touch guys.  Nothing like it.

As I have said before.  I do parties for myself.  If they don't go off, it
is something I did wrong, the scene does not have ANY responsibility to
help me make my money/time/effort/spirit back.  I go in with the
expectation of doing my best to do a good party.  I have yet to throw my
best party (due to budget), and I have yet to throw my worse (that too will
come ;) ).  But I will never blame the community for MY mistakes.  I would
suggest you do likewise.

If it ever comes between a party done by Preston and another friends, I
will go to both, and one will suffer (laughs) by me leaving.  I can only
hope that they will not be dissed (likely) and allow me to go unfettered
with guilt, to my next locale.  Blaming people for leaving to go to a RARE
event like GBW is weak....

Was your party to your satisfaction? YES!
Did you have the space & sound you wanted? YES!
Did your friends show up? YES!
Did they have a good time? YES!

Uh, forgive me gentlemen, but your party sounds like it went off to me!

So lighten up, and (sheesh I never thought I'd say this) get off of the 250
who care about you'ze guys's back.  Chalk it up to experience and move on.
You're just experiencing what every other promoter experiences when they
get into this biz.  Besides, IT'S JUST A PARTY!

I DO hope you do another one.  And I DO hope I am invited.

I've almost said enuf,
John

P.S.  The numbe of parties you throw means NOTHING unless everyone knows
what you've done or are doing.  PROMOTE, PROMOTE, PROMOTE!!!!

and dammit, KEEP IT ALIVE!

Subject: how to keep the scene alive, maybe
Status: 


I hear JSL talking about networking, friends, and the grapevine, and he
has a good point.  It is difficult to create a temporary community out of
an amp stack and good intent.  I will not go to an event alone unless I
am really sure it's going to be great, but I will go with friends if it's
even a bit cool.  Here, folks, is my main problem:

Raves tend to not have ANYPLACE where you can sit and just talk with people.
Even the ambient room is usually too loud for reasonable conversation.  I
get tired trying to shout over several hundred watts.  This makes it
difficult to actually meet anyone new or talk about anything for longer
than it takes to score some blotter.  I show up feeling alone, and leave
with a similar feeling, hoping only to catch some infectious smiles along
the way.

Penelope's Web was special for this reason; we could actually hang around
and interact in more ways than foolish grins on the dance floor, which I
am all for but don't suffice completely by themselves.  Burning Man left
me with that same feeling.

So how about it, promoter-types?  We're a long way from being able to make
friends with no words at all.  Let's roll with that knowledge.  Even if I
do just want to dance for six hours straight, I feel much better knowing
it is my choice to hang with the bass.  I gather YSH has a before-time,
which sounds great, but I live in SJ and work days so I can't make it.

Does anyone else think this is a good idea?

John, I ask, in all sincerity and deep curiosity, what constitutes a "personal
invitation" to you?  I have asked you privately, and since you've taken
this public, I think we'd all like to know what the *fuck* it's gonna
take to make you feel welcome.  I'm not the only one wanting you to come
to parties.

and i ask that question of all of you.  what makes you feel welcome,
at home, at ease?  I really want to know. i'm just a fumbly fellow
with no social skills who's groping about for an answer. any help
you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

and, i would appreciate it if you spoke for yourself, and not for everyone
else on the list.  and while you're preaching at ethan and i for "preaching",
step back and listen to what we're saying.  i am saying, "hey, you, i 
consider *you* a part of my family." and i mean that from my heart. i 
extend my family to each and every person on this list, lurkers and 
prominent citizens alike.  perhaps i should have titled my post: "I 
mourn the loss of my family". cause i've gone out of my way for you all
for four months, carried 2 tons of sound equipment to hell and gone.
and *i*, like ethan, didn't do it for the money, the notoriety, or
anything ego centered. i did it because i wanted to provide myself and
*you* with experiences that were positive, fulfilling, safe, enjoyable,
and fun.  i *have* opened up the time/space/music/dance continuum, and
made a spot in my heart and in the world for *you* and *i* to become
a community in the flesh.  not some fuzzy electronic community, but
a celebration of the physical made otherwhen.

i'm sad that you missed out. i really missed you all, cause my events
just fill me with such bliss. i want to share that bliss with you.

i'd really like to think that there's more to this than naked commercialism
and a return to the high school popularity contest. because i wouldn't
play then, and i refuse to play that game now.  zero sum games are not
where it's at.

so, folks, i'll keep plugging away, trying this and that, and i hope you
can come some time, and see what a difference a community can make.
give my voice mail a call some time...i PERSONALLY invite you all.

I am sorry I never got to answer your question privately.  I typed a long
essage to you then deleted it advertently.  In any case, I like a PHONE
call or a PAGE. If I see you out, talk to me.  Anything else, from anyone
else is bunk.  If I get a flyer, that's ok, but not personal enough for me
these days.  If I get a flyer and seek you out at a show and you talk to
me, that is as good as gold.  But the effort is all YOU.  I like to talk to
people (as a  matter of fact, I LOVE to talk to people) so vox to vox
communication is the best for grouchy old jsl.  Another thing.  I depend on
word of mouth from my friends.  IF they ain't hyped about something then I
know people have not been getting the excited word out.  I know that if I
am invited I will bring folx who will pay.  That is MY way of saying
THANKS FOR THE PERSONAL TOUCH.  But don't expect me to make the first move.

I look forward to your next event.

Subject: the way it is
Status: 

This is in reference to the thread about Liquid Air.

Based on what is happening and on JSL's sensible description of "the way it is 
and the way things are done" I have tell you all, I am a bit unhappy with "the 
way it is" in the San Francisco rave scene.  It is coming across to me as 
really being a SCENE, and not some community.

To me raving was always about doing it yourself, not having to play any special 
political games like inviting certain people or promoters by phone or chariot, 
by just getting out there and, in the words of Frankie Bones, "bringing music 
and dancing to places where there wasn't music and dancing before."  

The fact that people say they don't even read the sfraves calendar makes me 
wonder if it's even necessary for Derek to go to the effort each week to put it 
out.

I am moving out to San Francisco in less than a month, and I refuse to sit
around and be disappointed because "that is the way it is."  Forget the way it 
is.  The real question is "how do you want it to be?"  Well, I know how I want 
it to be:  I'd like to bring a bit of the East Coast net-rave experience with 
me -- that lovely feeling of building excitement as people decide what parties 
they are going to and arrange to meet before for dinner so they can get to know 
each other in person before hitting the floor.  The feeling of cooperation when 
early in the week all the people who can give rides report they have space, and 
then all the people who need rides know who to ask so that the community is 
taken care of.  The feeling of energy when someone says "I am throwing a party" 
and immediately the list starts buzzing with plans.  Going to breakfast en 
masse afterwards.  The feeling that a party (whether we throw it or just 
decide to attend it) is more than just music and dancing, but is an affirmation 
of us as a community, and is a sort of family reunion.

Yes, I probably sound selfish here, and you can tell me all you want about how 
wrong I am and how I can't possibly understand what is happening.  Well, I'm 
also hard-headed, and so I am still going to give it a try.   I refuse to 
feel alone in San Francisco, and I refuse to feel like a fringe player on
a peripheral team.

Stay tuned for details . . . magick is in the air.

Love and community,

Laura

I went to this last year, and it was a lot of fun.  The Grateful Dead
parking lot village was a fun place to hang out, and the cultural
cross pollination that took place between ravers & deadheads generated
a very positive vibe.  If you ask me, this will be worth passing up on
the Gathering for, which is just gonna be another typical massive.  You
can take BART there, and of course there is plenty of parking.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have not followed this thread at all, but I know personally that 
Derek does a great job with the calendar and it is appreciated.  
I know lots of people that are not on sfraves, but are on sfraves-calendar, 
and rely on it weekly.  I have also referred my friends not on either, 
to the events on the calendar and they have thanked me for it.

EEK! If Brian and Derek hadn't been doing the calendar. I'd be lost.
It's the reason I got on the list in the first place. It's _very_

off copies and hand them out at events. The reaction from newbies is:
"Wow!" "This is great!" "Thanks!" "Can I have a bunch to give to my
friends?"

The calendar does a LOT of good, and I just want to say that out loud.

(Now, if I printed it on edible paper, it might be serious competition
for Lucky Charms)

Oh, by the way, does anyone know where I can find some recycled paper
suitable for copiers or laser printers? I'd feel better about handing out

Laura, the San Francisco rave Scene is hugh, it comprises, on any one
weekend, from 2000 - 10,000 people who go to parties.  The group of
people who go out EVERY weekend most likely consists of about 1000
people, of these people, some have the notion that it is a community,
some don't, the ones who at least have a feeling of community try their
best to support as many parties as their stamina and pocket-books
alow.  Some folks even stay up for 2 - 3 days without using speed just
to go to and be at parties with their friends.  What you will find is
that you can't keep this up forever,  This up coming New Years will be
my third New Years as a raver,  I've gone to a minimum of 4 to as may
as 16 parties per month for over two years straight,  I've lugged
equipment, taken people who had to much meth to the hospital, and got
dosed people suffering from hypothermia off of rocks, and risked being
arrested by the police, if I threw a party and nobody came I would'nt
take it personally, I would think that I didn't promot it enough.  I
don't mean to to be mean to you but I must say that you have only
visited here, you have not gone out or played out here on a regular
basis, I respect your opinion but I think your judgements are a bit
premature and uninformed.

Laura, raving is about doing it yourself and If I threw a party and no-body
came, I would feel hurt and disappointed but I wouldn't give up.  If just one
or two of my friends showed I would be happy (as opposed to no-one) but 
bear in mind that on any one weekend there are at least 5 or so parties to 
choose from, on the "Christmas rush" there are more like 10 parties per weekend
between the 1 st of December through new years.  Many of the promoters make
their living out of throwing parties, (some approach it as a business, some
as an artform and throwing parties is their medium of expression, for some
it literally is a religion and a lifestyle choice).  Many of these people
have been throwing Acid House parties (and what preceeded them) for almost
10 years, they are natural and intuitive at knowing what it takes to draw
a crowd.  As far as the calendar is concerned, derek (and brian before him)
runs a service, like the new your times (which I don't always read) I may
not read it but I'm very glad it's there if I need it.  Most of the parties I
go to these days I go to because my friends are going and It fits in my schedual
It's not because I don't support what a group is doing but you have to realize
I get invited to dozens of parties, and I've noticed that some people get really
offended if I don't show, (I don't know if they think I'm some great rave god
or something, who should grace their parties and are offended if I don't come)
but it might just be that I'm too tired or have to have a brain the next day
when the VC (venture capitalist , not viet cong, although sometimes, I'm not so
sure :) come a callin'.  For some people who don't go out regularly, the 
calendar is the ONLY way they will find out about a party.

How can you dance hard with all that food sloshing around in your stomach :)

In all fairness, there are families that do exactly that out here, there are
probably more people who do that here than there if you were to talk about
sheer numbers, If I throw a party or if the list throws a party, many people
may work on it, if it is a small private thing, I'm not worried if only a few
show.  If you are throwing public parties and you want that certainty of draw,
there are things you have to do, when I first came across this, I thought it
was crass, but then I saw people put up their rent money and loose it because
they didn't promote enough.  If you want to throw parties for your friends
by all means do it, and invite them as FRIENDS, don't throw a public party
and get upset because your friends don't come.

There are dozens of different types of parties in the Bay Area, in this
way I think it is different from the east coast, out here every one and
his sister is a promoter or DJ or has a lighting company or smart drink
company.  This makes for countless combinations, some people like to
sample some will stick with something that is fairly constant.  You
know sometimes I say to myself, I should go to Cool World or Wally's
World or some of the other really commercial raves, if I go there and
be myself and radiate the brightest that I can, many won't get it, some
will think I'm crazy or weird of blasted out of my mind but if even a
teeny weeny few catch the vibe, maybe it's worth it.  But then I think,
gosh I really need to know that the music will be good and see some
familiar faces and then I get scared that the one day out of the week
tha I get to let loose might get wasted and I go to WICKED or to GROOVE
KITCHEN or the GATHERING because I know that at least Martin , Trish &
Al and Preston are consistant, I know I'll see the same old DJ's and
maybe hear a set that I've heard one time too many but then there are
times like last saturday when Jeno and Markie rearranged my basic
genetic make-up and It makes up for all the not so great sets that Jeno
has been playing lately (it's not every day that the DEA takes your
lover away, and throws her in prison) and besides, if I can't stick by
him now, what kind of family is this indeed, so I do go and support DJs
that have given so much to me and I let them know that I appreciate
what they have and are doing, I'm sorry if there is not enough of me to
spread around the entire scene, but even I have to sleep, rest (and
get sick) sometimes.

Laura, I look forward to you coming out here, I hope your energy pays
off and you can make the positive changes that you envision,  please
try not to get disillusioned if it doesn't happen exactly like you want
it to, jsl DOES have a point, no matter what happens to you, what
experience you are having, or how cosmic it is, IT IS JUST A PARTY,
that's what makes the whole thing so beautiful, out in the world is
where we have to achieve the reality that the party suggest is
possible.

   I made it to the party,   although I was somewhat late due to the fact that
I was supposed to meet someone who didn't show up and flaked me out.
After waiting for him to show up,    I finally gave up,   and got 
there about 2:30 or 3 pm.    After being awake for 4 days since YSH,
I felt extra tired that afternoon,  due to a very stressful week of
job hunting,  and all week,  I was severly depressed,   but was always
looking forward to raving.    Time is running out for me now,   and very
soon I'll be on the streets or in homeless shelter,   not being able to
afford to go to raves unless I can get on guest lists,  which I manage
to do sometimes for the mega-raves.

   Ethan,  if you want,  I can meet you at YSH and pick up your flyers and
not only spread them around,   but will also put in my energy and pursuasive
power to get them to come.   And if you cannot make YSH,  try and get some
other SFRavers to bring me some.    Although THIS weekend,   I will be in
Austin on a planned trip so cannot make any parties this weekend.

If there is one thing you can say about good 'ol Martin, he sure is consistent.
Yep, the 2 Year Anniversary of the Gathering is goin 'on.  I was talking to
Josh, who asked me to come to the show, and he promised a rockin' set.

Damn, it's been that long?  Well, I did not go out this past weekend, but
this weekend (since my son and wife will be out of town) will be daddy's
day/night to play.  I will bring my saddle, spurs, and some chaps, why?
Because, even if you can't lead a horse to water, you can turn him into
soap...as soon as it dies.  The Gathering may outlive us all!!!

I hope that Martin does it right tho!  Please get some visuals other than
those, er, slides.  Please get some video or something.  Maybe I'll bring a
TV cart, since, as some of my friends have commented, that will be the only
visuals there :) :) :)

Well I have a plan, just in case ,Martin decides against the idea of
high-tech...it's called psychoactive elements for the enhancement of form
and function.  Can you say FUCKED UP?  In order for me to ride that horse
again that's what I'll have to be.  Ashamed, nope, I just consider it a
hazard of the job.  But more importantly I consider it a DUTY!

It's the least I can do to celebrate the horse the refuses to die ;)

Subject: Weekend update
Status: 

I packed a business and Grateful Dead trip in with some serious party
happenings.  Came back from Sacramento Thursday night in time for a good
portion of YSH.  I missed DRC, unfortunately, but Rebecca was throwin'
some great tracks -- she is probably the most experimental DJ I've heard
anywhere.  Sometimes it doesn't reach me dancing-wise, but she's always
got great food for musical thought.  

Friday my work call was cancelled so I moseyed over to Berkeley and spent
a couple interesting hours at Primal Records.  Later I did a quick spin
through Corduroy City.  I would highly recommend this based on my single
visit this time plus the word I'm hearing.  It's a nice crowd, YSH-sized,
the price is right ($5) and the DJs are quite good.  It was mostly
straightforward house onna garage tip while I was there; didn't catch
the names of the DJs, and didn't get to see the hoped-for Farina/Carter
matchup.  

I slogged through the rain to Giamma's party only to find Ethan and Derek
and the gang finishing on the cleanup; sorry I missed that one.  That
Clara St. space is a nice though small one.  I was thinking about trying
out Martini, the club scene at Folsom around the corner, but contrary to
their flyer which said close-down at 6 am, it was all done by 3:15.

On the other hand, right across the street at 1028 Folsom was an odd house
party with a DJ spinning basically the scene hits of 1993 (didn't hear
Robin S, that was about the only one he didn't play!).  It
is a small space and about 20 people were there; they were asking $5 at
the door and it was nice just to sit and relax.  It looks like the space
is used for theatre rehearsal, a small stage and floor area.  The
turntables were on a plank hanging from the ceiling (like at DNA) so 
I suspect the space is used regularly for underground kewl stuff.  

Saturday I spent a couple of ecstatic hours vinyl hunting at Tweekin', 
where I started my quest in earnest in September.  Having visited record
stores in SF, Berkeley, Portland, Seattle, San Diego, Sacramento, DC,
New York and New Brunswick NJ in the last two months, I was amazed at
how good Tweekin's selection sounded in comparison.  Not to put down the
other stores -- Star and BPM and Primal and the new Platinum right here
in Portland have great stuff too . . .

Saturday night was the Wicked Groove, of course.  I actually thought it
was a rather flat affair.  The old DJ booth in the dark room has been
torn out and a temporary one set up by the front door.  Made it less
intimate but also easier to move around.  In the main room was the usual
massive, less obnoxious than the last Wicked there and I had overall a
pretty good time.  When the breakbeats came along around 3 am and I got
a little bored, there was GOOD slow/hiphop-y stuff down in the basement.
The ambient area with the bar and fireplace upstairs was OK, but the
mixing wasn't ambient at all . . .

I second Geoff's comments about Jeno's set -- it was quite a bit better
than the recent ones I've heard from him (and there was a period in
October and November where I seemed to land in the same vicinity quite
often, all the way through the Aphex/Orbital/Moby show).  But I also
think the vibe was basically not very present -- certainly not like the
Wicked at the Stone in June, for example.  No matter . . . Wish I'd been
able to stay for Markie's turn, but I had to go catch some sleep before
flying down to San Diego for the Grateful Dead (but that's another story!).

Which meant I also had to miss Liquid Air.  I hope Bryce and Ethan keep
doing that . . . it's hard to be patient, but I think the scene is at an
inflection point where people are going to start looking for quality events
again.  At least I sure hope so!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it seems that it's time for me to push the reset button on my
participation in SFR.  Consequently, if you want to say something to
me, that will be best accomplished via private email to the address below.

Before i do go, though, i would like to take the opportunity to say one
last round of thank you's:

thanks to all the DJs who played at the events i helped organize: jon drukman,
lee an, laura la gassa, tamara palmer, ed, pete ashdown, ethan, timothy, tamotsu
and chris (as well as kenneth paul, susan, and doran).  these folks are
truly wonderful people, and great DJs.  if you are organizing an event, know
someone who is, or just want to hear great talent, please talk with these
folks.  and, if you see their name on a flyer or an event on the calendar,
please go see them!  I mean it---these are really GREAT DJs!! 

thanks to ethan miller for having the most wonderful sound system i've ever
heard.  ethan cares about sound, folks.  if you need a sound system, talk
to him.  if you have an opportunity to go to an event where sound vision
is in the house, GO!

another thanks to ethan and to dave scruton (SCRUTON@delphi.com) and pete
ashdown for their graphical design talents.  they have all helped produce
some of the most wonderful flyers i've ever seen.  they are all quite
talented, geniuses with type and images.  look them up sometime.

thanks to bob ramstad and brian behlendorf for DATing these events.  these
two are on time and on target, and provide a high quality service for the
community: auditory records of the best talent in the bay area. and, buy
some tapes from bob if you haven't already: bob cares about sound reproduction
in a way i only dream of.

thanks to all the people who helped set up, tear down, and lug equipment
for these events.  you know who you are, and frankly, that meant more
to me than any one other thing.  it's a chop wood, carry water kind of
thing...the hard physical work that must be done to make these things
go off.  my cap is off to you      d :->

thanks to each and every one of you who braved the real world to visit one
of our events.  your presence was felt, seen, and appreciated.  glad to 
share some moments with you.

if i have neglected anyone, please forgive me...truly and only my fault
for forgetting.

finally, please accept my deepest apologies for offending anyone in my
eagerness and naivete.

Hugh has been with us since the beginning of the rave scene here in San 
Francisco.He doesnt come out often anymore,but when he does,you know it.
Recently he has shown up at some seminal events wearing nought but a 
string of Christmas tree lights.He is a hyperdimensional being who
exists mostly in the space "between" (a simplification)

Subject: The Scene, The Dream, & The Reality
Status: 

Allow me to share some observations I've made concerning the scene.  For 
a lot of people, including myself, raving was the most amazing, uplifting, 
fulfilling, social experience I have *ever* had: The music, the vibe, the 
altered states, the feelings of love & connectedness, the potential for 
social change in our society, the chance to meet and hug wonderful caring 
people... Like a lot of the people who were attracted to raving,  I never 
really had much in the way of a social life before this.  The SF House 
scene was a dream come true on many levels.  

It was easy to be idealistic when the scene was new and growing, and I was
just discovering it.  But then, reality reared it's smug face.  People who 
loved each other when high on e suddenly realize that they have little in 
common except that they enjoy loving each other when high on e.  Suddenly, 
relationships seems empty and contrived.  Strong relationships take time, 
work, desire, proper circumstances and a lot of intangiables.  Same thing 
with social movements, and the establishment of viable communities.  
Ultimately, it's a lot easier for most people to step back and say, "it's 
just a party." 

There is nothing more painful than when dreams get shattered.  I've seen 
people grow disallusioned and drop out from the scene altogether.  What's
hard is that raving has given us a strong taste of what *might* be - if 
only those beautiful moments when it really *does* happen can be extended 
to encompass a bigger chunk of our Universe.  

I've been going through periods of disallusionment for a while now.  Even 
if I didn't have to work for a living, I see that I cannot make Raving my 
*whole* life.  But still, because what happens at *some* parties represents 
to a large extent what I think life should be about, I will never consider
such gatherings to be "just a party".  As long as I can experience those 
special moments, and maybe help create a few, I'll put up with egotistical 
promoters, undependable friends, and the unfulfilled promises of a scene 
that never really promised me anything.  I still think that the scene is a
good one, and at times very special.  There are enough forces at play and 
enough people on the same wavelength to insure that the future holds some 
incredibly beautiful moments for us.  Perhaps it is for the best that
these beautiful moments aren't too easy to achieve, because in the end, I'm 
not really sure I would want to continuously live the same dream anyway.

peace/love/energy/truth to all.

Yea!!  I really like the "Upper room" a lot.    Easy to get to,  plenty
of parking south of Market (On 8th St).    Sound is slightly wimpey,  but
I suspect that is due to noise complaints,  and was why the windows were
kept closed this time,    but I always welcome the opportunity to go
outside and "chill" when I get too hot from dancing.

Oh!  I do,  don't worry about that.    On Sunday evening,   I crash early
and to "wind down" I do yoga,  and put myself into a deep trance.    Sometimes
during the 4 days of raving,   in the afternoon,   I go into a deep trance
for an hour or so,   which for me is equivelant to about 5 hours of sleep,
as I've learned to shut my system down for short periods of time.   As one
gets older,  one needs less sleep.   I have to do these 4 day rave marathons
to keep my sanity,  as I am in a very severe depressed state of mind when
I'm not raving,   due to the huge uncertaintly of my future right now.

Lee says:

For me,  it is the "Fountain of youth".  I have NEVER been so physically fit
and felt so wonderful in my life since I started dancing at raves,  and meeting
the wonderful people at them.    I feel like everyone is part of
a large family,   and it makes me feel really great to have people come up to
me,  thanking me for putting in so much energy.   This only causes me to 
turn on yet more energy,  and to be hopping around the dance floor,   generating
as many smiles as possible is really exhilerating for me.   I hope I can continue
to participate,   but meager finances in the future will really curtail my
involvement in the rave scene,  as more and more often,  I am going to have
to try and get on guest lists as my finances drain away.   So far,   somehow
I manage to either find a generious soul who can pay my way in,   or often
through the generosity of promoters,  get on guest lists.    I really hate
not putting in money to those people that diserve it (DJ's,   Ethan,  and the
other really dedicated folks to the scene),  but eventually,  someone out there
might hire me for work again,  but right now,  there is just NO work for this
mac programmer,  one of 11,000 Mac Hackers out of work,  competing for the
meager 10-15 job openings that occur every month.

I'm looking forward to the next YSH,  as it will be my ONLY rave this
week,  because on Friday,  I head out to Austin (No raves there- Bummer!)
for a hackers gathering.  HoHoCon to be exact.    I bought the ticket while
I was working,   and am really looking forward to going,  but I really
am going to miss the Gathering,  and I hope to see a good report on it
when I return.     This weekend,  I will miss all you folks,  and will
be thinking of you all.    And am sorry that I won't be able to pump in
my energy this weekend,  but I'll make up for it when I return.

See Ya all at YSH...  Party on...

Subject: Re: The Scene, The Dream, & The Reality
Status: 

I appreciate the comments that Lee and others have been making the last
couple of days.  I too was pretty disillusioned in September.  The summer
was pretty much a fizzle overall for the scene, and there seemed to be a
lot of negative vibe floating around.  It got me focused again on why I'm
interested in doing all this, and I decided I really do still like it.
Things have turned up since then.  I'd say another factor in addition to
my continued enjoyment of both the SF scene and the online net.folks has
been the renaissance of the Seattle scene.  So what did I do?  I went out
and bought turntables and a bunch of vinyl.  The urge was obvious back in
May, it just had to percolate for a while.  

My feeling is similar to Lee's . . . Rave is dead, long live rave.  I am
especially interested -- at my, er, advanced age, where I do "have a life"
and all that good stuff -- in helping move this scene out of its fixation
with money.  Once again last weekend in chatting with a friend I heard the
sentiment that somehow raving is associated with "good" capitalism -- an
opportunity to make a buck and get off.  I can't stop the folks who are
in it just for the bucks -- the source of much of Bryce and Ethan's
frustration in sucking out a lot of vitality from this scene and taking
away from their superlative efforts -- but I'd like to think I have a
role in building up an alternative.  And really, it's happening although
maybe not in as expansive a way as we'd like.  We're all tired of the 
bullshite that constantly misguides and undermines the scene, the
constant threat of cooptation from record companies and fast-buck artists
of all types (including those peddling crystal and other raunch for
quick profit), the musical complacency of a fair bit of events and
audiences, the whole thing.  

But when looking back on 1993, although I don't see another Summer of Love,
I definitely see a year of growing up.  Not to overplay the positive aspects
of it, but it seems to me that the net.ravers add up to a noticeable if not
large part of the effort to keep the vibe going.  We've had an impact, even
if people don't recognize where it comes from or why it happens.  

I grew up in a neighborhood of Washington, DC called Brookland.  In retrospect,
in a nation that was sprouting bland suburbs as fast as concrete could be
poured, it was a pretty remarkable place -- multiracial, multiethnic, and
committed to a progressive view of how people could really get along with
each other and not just handwave at positive slogans.  One of the things
that really sustained Brookland was a local folk dance group that was 
probably the rave of its time.  We had a dance teacher who played the
records and taught us various different styles from Israel, Ireland,
the Philippines, Yugoslavia, wherever.  It started out in people's
houses -- my family was the host off and on for a year, and ended up
getting large enough to be in the parish hall.  I was just a kid and 
I missed out on all the personal stuff, but I'm sure it was there --
the ego tripping, mistrust, gossip and what have you.  But that was
minor in comparison to the sense of cohesion and fun it brought to my
neighborhood.  

In the same way, I'm trying to walk the line between foolish optimism and
ordinary cynicism in the current scene.  There are plenty of aspects that
I don't find to be positive or helpful, but it's still so much more
interesting than anything else going.  There's a group of people out there
who are really dialed in to the sounds of future dance music, and there's
a ton more who can be reached over time with the right approach.  That's
why events like Liquid Air which are pushing the envelope of expectations
about what can be done with this music and the scene around it are so
important, even if they nominally fall short of their expectations.  
We know for sure this stuff doesn't have a total home in clubland.  It
needs the underground to furnish energy and innovation.  The audience
for marginal events ('marginal' in the sense of on the margins of the
commercial sphere, not at all relating to quality, since underground
events are often far better than sanctioned ones) is always going to be
shifting and unpredictable in its response.  But responding to that is
the pledge we have to make given how far out on a limb we are musically
and culturally in a society where going out to the movies or seeing any
kind of live music is becoming an unusual event.  I mean, we live in the
era where the big media giants want to entice us further into the domestic
cocoon with 500 channels of noninteractive "entertainment."  So this is
still pretty radical stuff we're involved with culturally.  (I have to
remind myself of that every time someone whacks me with their elbows on
the floor at 1015 Folsom :)

In the Grateful Dead scene, we have a little saying based on one of the
band's tunes . . . I may be going to hell in a bucket, baby, but at least
I'm enjoying the ride!

I think the exchange of opinions among Ethan, Bryce, John and others here
the last couple of days, while a little sharp in tone at times, has been
a really clear laying out of the issues we're dealing with right now both
as event goers and event doers.  I really feel we're involved with something
very worthwhile here but the process is far from an easy one.  The scene
continues to change and is probably through with its most evolutionary
phase, but I bet most of us are still doing this to some extent or other
a year from now and into the future.

Shouts out to my Seattle posse!  It would be great if the Seattle and SF
net folks could get together at some point over the weekend.  

As for the event list, Friday sure is busy.  All four could be good.  
I am particularly partial to King St. for historical reasons, but if it
gets too crowded it's not great there.  The Troc is big but hasn't had
any really great events that I've been to anyway since last winter.
I've never been to a Happy Happy Joi Joi but the lineup is really good.
As for DRC, she should be an honorary nw-raver since she grew up in
Boise :)  She plays great trance, and will also be holding forth at the
End Up on Friday night I think.  Also on Friday presumably will be another
Corduroy City -- I had a fine time at that one last week.

I'm doing three Grateful Dead shows this weekend in Oakland so it's going to
be especially mad/amazing for me!  And of course Sunday evening the two 
scenes will be united courtesy of the Atomic Rooster in the Oakland Coliseum
parking lot (here's hoping for dry weather . . . but then us Northwesterners
can handle a little dampness now, can't we?!).

I'd definitely like to extend a warm welcome to all our friends from
Seattle and suggest Atomic Dog (was Rooster) as a great place for us to
rendezvous. This party is really shaping up nicely. So far confirmed djs
are:

Markie
Moonpup

Doran has expressed interest in playing as well. 
Visuals wil be courtesy of the city of Oakland.
Vibe courtesy of *you*.

hi folx, lee
i think lee put it very beautifully that we have glimpses of how we can
be with each other in certain circumstances. but i would not push this
way of relating into a 'box' like 'rave,' 'party.' i think the difficulty
is keeping this vibe going on after the 'party' is over, that we let
this new way of interacting with others affect us in other circumstances,
so that we are open and friendly most of the time, not just at  rave.
of course  'reality' creates conflict, but this is what i  have
learned from you, that this reality is changeable and that we can change
it to a more communal, open, caring one.

(especially since I play at 9)  It should be alot of fun!  I have alot of new

Where I work we use recycled paper for our fax copier, laser printer
and copier. It is manufactured by Hammermill (I believe). We just
order it from an office supplies place. Try JC Paper. They're a big
paper products wherehouse firm. Probably one in Sac. I KNOW there's
one in Santa Clara. If not just call around. BTW, it's kind of a light
brown color similar to newsprint but doesn't tear as easily.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I would expect the Atomic Dog to do the
woof'n'hoof in the north parking lot of Oakland Coliseum (that's where
all the vending scene usually is).  Presumably it won't be hard to
pick out the phat beats amid all the Dead and Garcia Band toonz playing
from assorted beat boxes and car stereos.

I'll be inside for the Dead show itself but will definitely be outside
after the show and perhaps for a bit before.

Subject: Re: The Scene, The $$$$$
Status: 


Once again last weekend in chatting with a friend I heard the
sentiment that somehow raving is associated with "good" capitalism -- an
opportunity to make a buck and get off.
-----------------------

I hear what you folks are saying WRT scam artists but I tend to get
the impression that some folks here feel that any money making is
inherently evil.  I agree that scam artists are bad, but there is a
readily discernible difference between a scam artist and someone
offering a good product for a reasonable price.  I think that this
is a recurring problem for many counter-cultural groups and their
collective aesthetics, and the motivation to avoid the morally
bankrupt financial policies of big money America is quite obvious
to me, but I think it is often taken too far-to the point where
people can't make any economic progress because of the stigma attached
to commerce.  Let's face it, if we don't make dollars we end up
in a bad way.  I personally believe that if this scene is to survive
and have an influence on the rest of society that ETHICAL means of
making money must be dreamed AND realized.  The reality of America
today is that if you want to be heard, you MUST put your money where
your mouth is.  If you think, for example, that what goes on in the
oil/auto industry has a negative impact on our society, then to
completely ignore alternative transportation and drive any and
everywhere is shooting yourself in the foot.  Obviously, many folks
don't have a practical means of non-automotive transportation, so
there is much work to be done to change that but the basic fact is
that you vote with your dollars.  The way you make and spend them
has a bigger impact than anything you could say.

Just my 2 billion dollars! ;-)

Subject: Re: The Scene, The $$$$$
Status: 

"some folks here" who feel money making is inherently evil does not
include me.  After studying economics a bit in the academic context
and then being steeped in it for the last decade in the practical
world of energy politics, creating a surplus or "making money" is not to me
by itself a bad thing.  It's a measure of success as well as a measure
of value and medium of exchange, and we all want to be successful.

What is poisonous is how general conformity in our society pushes us
towards money-making as some kind of all-encompassing goal.  If you're
good at doing something and people are willing to pay you reasonably
for it, so much the better.  But it's so easy for that to become the
major objective -- not just putting a roof over one's head, but gold
plating it.  When I read about 'rave' promoters in the UK tooling
around in their Bentleys I conclude that something is amiss.  First
off, it's my observation that enormous windfalls occur seldom to the
lucky and more often to the devious.  And the scene is full of sharp
characters aiming to squeeze a few more dollars off the trusting.
Those of you who like me have paid for an event at a map point only
to have the event busted or worse yet not go off at all, please raise
your hands :)  Or the much more common event: go to an event with a
four-color flyer and a zillion phone numbers, but only half the 'name
DJs listed.  

Money is also the source of endless hassling between record companies
and artists, partners in events and shops, and among party-goers, 
particularly in regard to exchange of various substances.  An indicator
of success and value and medium of exchange also becomes a focus of
mistrust, uncertainty and irritation, all the way up to greed and ripoff.

I am not "for" those aspects of making money but it seems to some degree
inherent in the human condition . . . or is it, at least to that extent?
One of the subtexts of 'raving' and of the TAZ concept is to go beyond
that, at least momentarily, to grasp at the essence of living that has
little to do with 'getting and spending.'  We all want and should be able
to put a roof over our heads and maybe have a little left over for some
nice stuff, but the question is when the pursuit of daily bread extends
beyond that and somehow changes one's character.  The image of the super-
wealthy but super-unhappy Rockefeller or Getty, or the common revulsion
at the prosperous but severely self-indulgent and vacuous yuppie, show
our ambivalent views as a society of our relationships to ourselves and
each other and our environment.  

I'm getting too preachy here so time to hop off the electronic soapbox.
But from my point of view this is much more than a simple 'for or against
making money' type of thing -- it cuts to the core of the promise and the
sometimes failure of the club/underground scene.

One thing I do strongly believe after my experiences over the years -- 
we get the kind of economy we want as a society.  If we are heedless,
self-indulgent and materialist, we get the kind of urban/industrial/suburban
mess that we've made in the 'greatest nation on earth', even amidst all of
our successes.  Supply can still meet demand, markets can still clear and
people can maximize their utiles in societies that *don't* end up the way
ours has.  The way things are going on this planet, I think it's a very
urgent task to work on that right here and now.  It's slow going and success
is certainly not assured, but the effort needs to be made.

In the "Feel" newsletter put out by Martin and company, Basics will NOT have
Jeno and Garth as was previously stated (he had fliers made up and everything);
apparently they are going to do the Wicked party instead (I am sure this is
just full of juicy politics).  The list for Basics is the same except that
Graeme will be there, as will DJ Dan (which was a big surprise to me; I think
Jon Williams is spinning some place far away on New Year's)..

just a little info...

Gathering is going to be incredible...I hope to see you there!

Heh, something similar happened out East:  an announcement was made saying 
that all the East Coast promoters had gotten together and decided NOT to 
throw competing New Years' parties . . . and now, 2 weeks later, I know of 
at least two parties (Fusion and Countdown) that will compete with the 
supposed one unifying New Years' celebration (Resolution).

SF has the raving population to support multiple New Years' parties, but
things are smaller and more tenuous in some ways out East.  The site for
the "one" party (Resolution) is certainly big enough to hold all the
active ravers on the East Coast.

Sorry to go off on a tangent, I just love intrigue.

I have been thinking a bit about Jeno and Garth doing Wicked on New Year's, and
it seems to me that Basics will at least be have different DJs than the
Gathering that's coming up.  I have never really heard DJ Dan go off (he's
quick) and I don't know about Grame, so I betcha it will go off...I am just
glad that there are a lot of New Year's events to please everyone's different
tastes...last year's gathering was so incredibly manic, it was amazing!  I
think this year (and it better not rain) will prove to be really cool...I
myself just want to enjoy the Gathering.. and deal with new year's after I go
through Christmas and everything else!

"For a lot of people, including myself, raving was the most amazing, uplifting,
fulfilling, social experience I have *ever* had: The music, the vibe, the
altered states, the feelings of love & connectedness, the potential for
social change in our society, the chance to meet and hug wonderful caring
people..."

This is why I like to go to raves, too.  And I've been to a few just as my
 normal, unaltered self and felt the Vibe even more.  So I don't think it's
 just an "E" thing.  The spirit is real!  

Maybe it is "just a party," but hey, parties are the place where people get
 together JUST to have a good time.  Think about it:  Most every other situation
 where people gather is for work.  Where there is hierarchy and bosses and
 control.  But a party is spontaneous and chaotic, even.  And whether you
 have a good time depends on EVERYBODY (well, maybe just most
 everybody) having a good time.  No matter who you are, you have the
 power to contribute to the groove.

Lee says more:

"There is nothing more painful than when dreams get shattered.  I've seen
people grow disallusioned and drop out from the scene altogether.  What's
hard is that raving has given us a strong taste of what *might* be - if
only those beautiful moments when it really *does* happen can be extended
to encompass a bigger chunk of our Universe."

Oh yes!  Raving makes me see people so differently.  For a week or so
 after a night of dancing and playing, everybody I see (scary strangers plus
 friendly pals) looks so human and real.   The tension I usually feel when 
walking through downtown Berkeley late at night (I work really late
 sometimes...) is gone, too.    I ask myself:  Why should I be afraid?  
Does being afraid of every person I see make it less likely that  they
 might jump me?

My wacky theory:  The advertisers and the corporations and the banks 
all want us to get our kicks only from buying things and not from each
 other.  They want to make us live in a culture where having is more 
important than being.  They want us to be obsessed with crime because
 crime is about stealing *things*, which is what they think life should 
be about.  Going to raves makes you realize that life is also about dancing
 and being happy and having a great time with a huge crowd of people
 you barely know!

So I just want to say to Bryce and Ethan and anyone else who's feeling 
blue:  the scene is good and so don't give it up!   I'm new to it and it's
 already improved my outlook 100%.  And thanks for throwing such 
great parties!

I really hope the days of confiscating water are over. After Get Down
etc Wicked at Richmond Civic Center, where the butthole promoters
confiscated my $3 of badly needed Gatorade*, I promised myself that
anyone with that kind of fucked up attitude would not get my business.
to the contrary, they will get _bad_ reviews, and a continuing "I
don't recommend their events" to my friends.

Likewise, those promoters that are friendly and willing to work _with_
people, to help them enjoy an event to its fullest, they get my full
respect and glowing recommendations. 

I know that my personal recommendations to friends have resulted in
probably $1000 worth of "which event" desicions to be made. And I'm
just one person without a lot of influence.

You know, I probably would have never paid attention to who promotes
events if it weren't for promoters treating me like shit. Now though,
because of this summer, a lot of people are paying attention to who
does what.

I totally agree with everything but busting parties. I hate nothing worse
than having to pay steep prices for such a necessity as water. However, all
busting parties is going to do is start a war and ruin the "scene".  This
happened for a while in SLC, i wont tell the story but it just started a
screaming match over the phone and both sides deciding they were the real
ravers.

If you don't like their party then don't go!

It's against the law to sell water, so they are selling you the cup.  I
imagine that if they overcharged you for the cup, you could bring some
legal action against these people.

I should make this point more clear.  When you buy something from
someone with "money", you are not just exchanging "money" for
something else.  "Money" can be used for lots of other things, so you
have bought, along with your Neat Thing, everything that the other
person did with the money you gave them for that Neat Thing.  When you
buy non-organic California table grapes, you have also bought some
toxic pesticides which are now in some migrant worker's bloodstream,
causing cancer, deformed babies, and dead children.  When you buy a
new car from Chrysler, you have also bought Lee Iacocca's cufflinks,
several tons of sulfur dioxide, and an unsightly pile of junk in the

Subject: Why Money Changes Things For The Worse
Status: 


When you pay money for something instead of doing it yourself or as
part of a collective, you are saying "I don't want the responsibility
of finding out about how to do this myself because it takes too much
time or effort, and I'd rather do something else I know more about,
exchange THAT for money, and then give the money to these other
people."

Note: This is NOT a value judgement, just a factoid.

We can't be sure, though, that this decision is wise, as these other
people might not do what you wanted; they might do it badly, they
might just take the money and run, they might use the profits to buy
guns for Central American fascists, or to deforest Oregon, or just
tool around in expensive, smog-belching cancer boxes that almost run
you down every day as you bike to work -- you get the idea.

One of the central tenets of consumer culture is to keep people
separated into the smallest groups possible, preferably of one.  No
extended families, no communal, group, or tribal life, and if you must
form a bond, keep it within the nuclear family, please.  By doing
this, people that make money selling stuff can sell hundreds of times
more than are actually needed because everyone, being separated, needs
to buy one for the rare times that they actually use them.  How often
do you use your vacuum cleaner?  any of your tools?  your bike or car?
your CDs or records?  your photography equipment?

Collectivization threatens to explode this foundation by drastically
cutting down the amount of stuff people want or need, therefore
collapsing our overinflated economy which makes us run 40 hours a week
in place just to keep pace with all the other people doing the same
thing -- burying ourselves under mounds of plastic, paper, and metal
trash that we have frantically sold back and forth to each other to
keep from falling behind in the race to accumulate more "money".

It would be nice to be self-sufficient, but many neat things require
more than one person to get them done, and I don't want to give them
all up because I can't do them all myself.  "Agitate, educate,
organize!" -- all at the same time, if you want to get anything done.

So: back to the money and responsibility problem.  Doing it yourselves
is the best way to do it right.  You know where the responsibility
lies.  Barter is not as direct, but still better than the impersonal
exchange of cash, as you will need to know a reasonable amount about
what the other people will be doing for you before entering into an
agreement.  It forces both sides involved to know more about what they
are doing, and keeps one side from amassing huge quantities of "money"
by fictional means (trading "stocks", etc., which creates and
destroys money out of thin air) and exchanging it for huge quantities
of real stuff without having actually produced any themselves.
Ideally, people would be perfect informed consumers, but I won't be
and you won't be.  It's just too easy to spend the money.

This, then, is why I distrust money: it removes people from the
consequences of their actions.  "Oh well, it's only money" is the
first step, but we need to take the second: "So what IS important
here?"

Now that's the kind of stuff that would prompt me to take more serious
action. A promoter like that deserves to be lambasted before the
entire SF community. An IRS investigation wouldn't be out of the

Status: 

Greetings friends, 

Just wanted to say hi and thank each and everyone of you for your feedback
in response to what was obviously a very emotional weekend.

I appear to have made the most human of mistakes by conceiving of
something, in this case the list, as what I wanted it to be rather than
what it is. I want it to be a tireless, ever-wakeful, omnipresent, cradle
of support for our collective and singluar dreams of what this scene, this
house, means, of what it can be. Needless to say, my definition is no more
valid *or invalid* than anyone else's. And indeed what I have found is that
this list is not *by default* anything more than a medium of communication;
and, in this case, the medium is not the message, the message is the
message. It's what we say to each other, it's what we do with each other
that forms the substance, is the message. This list will be what we make
it. Thus it can be many things; it can be community and it can be vapor.
And when it is not what we wanted it to be, perhaps it is because we didn't
make it so.

It was foolish and naive of me to expect you to have my thoughts in your
head, and it was rude of me to then berate you for not having them. For
this I apologize. I hope, however, that one thing is clear: I really,
really, care about this scene, about what we can do together. It changed my
life and I will never be the same.

Liquid Air lives, SoundVision lives, chez groove, home, Vortex, db, basics,
wicked, GK (to name just a few ;)) and a myriad of other potential
blossomings await the interaction of our collective and singular dreams. 

Let's take it to a new level; lets get *together* to provide quality
alternatives for ourselves. From the responses I've gotten this week, I'm
happy to say its already happening. I plan on taking a much more organized,
personal, and group-based approach in trying to make quality events happen;
I urge you to join me. Anyone interested, please e-mail me your addresses,
phone numbers, and any other relavent information regarding yourselves and
what you can bring to the picture.

see ya on the dance floor  :)
peace always
ethan

The Haze Theater (16th and Harrison) is notorious for what you describe. 
We went a couple times last summer. Not only did they take our water, 
they took our candy (because the lollipops had sticks) and my girlfiend's 
fountain pen (thought she would write on the walls with it). We should 
have never went in, but we surley never went back. I believe it's the 
management and not necessarily the promoters in this case.

Hi folks - 

You probably saw it on the calendar, but I wanted to let all my friends on
SFR know about the party.  Yep, we're doing another Atomic Rooster - the
Dead have returned to the Oakland Coliseum, and we're returning to the north
parking lot.  d;-)  I'm spinning an ambient set at 6 for about an hour, then
the dance music starts with Ethan, Josh, Moonpup and Markie!    

For those who missed the last two, this will be a fun little free party
under the stars which is also accessable via BART [get off at the coliseum,
and walk to the right till you hear the booming bass.]  They usually close
the lot at about 2 am...  we'll be going till then.  

Also, this is the last Atomic Rooster!  Chinese New Years is just around the
corner [well, February] and we'll be back in the Year of the Dog with our
new name - Atomic Dog.  Woof!

M Normal

PS - questions, comments etc should be cc'd to me cuz I no longer receive
mail from the main list.  See you sunday!  d%-)

It's a measure of success as well as a measure

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Your joking right?  The only measure of success it is, is that you were
successful at getting money, wheather you worked hard for it or deserve
it or are a successful HUMAN BEING i.e., nice, polite, kind, generous,
etc. is something completely different.  Look how many spoiled, rich
ass-holes have inherrited money from the "success" of a reletive 5 or
more generations back, who may have exploited the fuck out of people  
such as a railroad system built in the west with chinese slaves, etc.

It's also incredibly easy to make more money if your rich already, it
takes money to make money.  Being smart and/or lucky helps but isn't
neccesarily neccesarry.

I'm not agains making money or capitolism but I think there should be
a ceiling on money accumulation.  Once you own a condo on Boardwalk,
get out of the game and enjoy your life, don't compete against everyone
else, making it harder for them by both compteting against them and
accumulating money, of which there is only so much.

Do Modona and Michael Jackson realy deserve  millions or billions of dollars
for what they have done?  I'm they would sit here and defensively tell me
that they worked harder than I can imagine, etc. and they did it all them
selves, blah blah blah.  They happened to have some talent and were born
in the right circumstances and were in the right place at the right time
to enjoy the ride up the pre-built snowlift of pop culture and then role
down as giant snow balls getting bigger all the way with no real work,
just exploitatin.  This isn't to say they have no talent, etc., I just
don't think they deserve all that money and extravigant lifes for what
they do, while farmers, etc. who may be and probably are good/better
people bust there asses for nothing.   Gee, lifes just not fair.

Excuse me for ranting but I'm sure most of you have expereinced the source
of my frustration, which is having trouble achieving goals and dreams that
you know are "true" because of lack of money while people like Madona glitz
around in decadent Marilyn Monroe-wanabe-life-styles-of-the-rich-and-famouse-

Status: 


Just thought I would announce my new and improved time-slot:

Sundays 6:30-9:00 PM          MESCALINA         KALX 90.7 FM

This should be much more convenient for listening than my previous friday
night midnight slot (I hope).  It's tough to receive the station from the
south bay, but it comes in loud and clear throughout the east bay, and
some parts of Marin and San Francisco can get it.  
  
In case you haven't seen my postings in the past, I should tell you all
that my radio show is not a non-stop techno mix, although it is definitely
electronically based, and often mixed (not necessarily by beats).  You may
here a smidgen or more of experimental noise, industrial, jazz, hip-hop, or
even classical, depending on my mood. I always include a few long and
indulgent mixed sets of techno or ambient stuff, but beware:  bouncy disco-
house is kept to an extreme minimum!

I almost always give away a few pairs of tickets for shows in the bay
area, and sometimes for rave events (Moby/Aphex Twin, etc...), so if you
can, give a listen! The phone number to request something or just to say
hi is 510-642-KALX.

Also, don't forget to catch Minor Minor on Saturday nights at 1am!!!!!

Jolly holidays to all :)

My pal Dave  and I just got back from the Coliseum parking lot party.
It was great to see the Dead audience jamming to the techno beat.  Lots
of smiles and happy people.  The Coliseum flunkies chased us all away
around midnight, though, saying something about getting ready for the
next day's event.  Oh well.  They started clearing everyone out pretty
much right after the show was over, but didn't get to the rave set-up
until later.  But it was great while it lasted.

Was this what you were talking about, A.R., when you said we need more
underground events?  Just a thought:  maybe we need to have more parties
at places with zero overhead, just so that nobody loses out if a huge
crowd doesn't show.

I couldn't agree more, but this would destroy laissez-faire and
self-enterprise.  Unfortunately, our entire capitalistic system is based on
selfishness, which paradoxically supposedly works for the good of the
collective.  (Although as of late I see this system floundering).  Take
away a person's right to accumulate innumerable amounts of money and you
destroy self-motivation and take the first step towards a communist
system.  (Marxism is actually extremely humanitarian, but even this system
in its entirety won't work because there aren't many altruistic people out
there who would voluntarily give of their goods to help support another. 
As a result a government would have to be created to implement
equality=Russia pre-1980's.)

being a native of new jersey, i feel exceptionally qualified to
judge rudeness ;).  from my perspective, most people in san
fran are _extremely_ sociable and polite, right down to the 
homeless tripped-out dudes asking for money ("no change man?
that's okay, you have a great day anyway.").

if you want a friendlier coffee shop, i'd suggest jammin java at

Subject: Why I didn't go to your rave: Adventures of Sean and Greg Goodvibe
Status: 

PART ONE: THE GATHERING

Promoted by Martin O'Brien

So Greg and Sean Goodvibe are chilling out at a friend's house,
enjoying some good company, getting psyched for the Gathering. A lot
of people we know are going to be there, so we think it ought to be a
pretty good time.

Time comes to go. We hop in the car, drive out there, park (we are
amazingly lucky at getting a close space), and get to the door at
1:30am.

They are confiscating open containers, but that's okay, I have no love
for booze at raves (the only fight I've ever seen was alcohol related,
and I had to break it up). We are thoroughly frisked, but that's okay
too; I have no love for weapons at raves.

The big sign says: NO REENTRY NO EXCEPTIONS.

Strike one. This is not necessary at raves. It might be fine for a two
hour concert, but not for an 8+ hour event. People need to be able to
leave, eat, and return. It's also nice just to be able to escape from
the space for a while (I'm claustrophobic).

We go in and talk to the cashiers:

"How late is the event going to run?"
"Six to six-thirty."

Hmmmm I think, that's only 5 hours from now. I was expecting more like
10am.

"How much?"
"Twenty dollars."

Strike two.

Twenty dollars? I thought the day of the 20 dollar rave was over. I
guess not. Well, I can afford twenty dollars, but I don't wanna. Greg
can't afford twenty dollars, not really. But we have twenty dollars
each with us so we start talking about it. Hmmm there's only 5 hours
left. Maybe I can get a discount? So I go talk to the cashier.

"Since it's almost halfway over, how about letting us in for ten, or
fifteen?"
"No."
"Are you sure? It's not likely we'll attend at all for twenty. You'll
get at least twenty dollars that way."
"No."

No room for negotiation. Hmmm. So Greg and I start discussing it. Do
we want to pay 20 for 5 hours of rave, hearing the same old name DJs?
Well maybe. Everyone said they'd be there. Maybe.

We're still trying to figure it out, when two security types come over
and tell us we have to leave.

"Can we stay in a few more minutes? We're still trying to figure out
whether we want to go in."
"Figure it out outside."

Strike three.

It's 40 degrees outside. And security is telling two very good natured
potential customers that they have to stand outside in the cold while
they make up their minds whether or not to be a customer?

We decided that if it's that fucked up outside, the promoter probably
doesn't give a shit about us once he's got our money. So we decided to
take it elsewhere, to not support Nazi security, expensive parties,
and inflexible promoters.

As we were leaving, I overheard two different groups of people also
deciding not to attend, one grumbling about the price, another
complaining how security had treated them. Both groups sounded like
nice people, too.

And all this, after hearing that sincere sounding plea on the phone
line: "Always always keep it alive."

What are you trying to keep alive? You're turning away some of the
most vibed up people in CA.  If you want to keep it alive, keep it
friendly, and keep it accessible.

PART TWO: COLORS

We checked the calendar. Rhythm was going on. But wait, it's 21+.
Strike one, two, and three. My very best friend in the world is 19
(I'm 31). If selling booze at raves is more important than letting my
best friend in, well...

So the other possibility is "Colors". I'm not sure who promotes it. We
have heard nothing about it. I know that one of the Harrison spaces is
"cursed". Is it 16th and Harrison where Colors is? I don't know.

We park and get to the door.:

"Can I take a brief look inside, to see what your party is about?"
"No."
"Are you sure, could I speak to the promoter?"
"No."
"How about if I left you with my ID, or had one of you walk in with me."
"No."
"Are you _sure_? It might mean another couple of paid admissions..."
"No."

What? Is this promoter STUPID? You've got people losing money all over
town and it's no wonder. Why this club mindset? Are promoters hiring
mentally retarded people for security?

What kind of message are we trying to send out? Does anyone even talk
to their security?

PART THREE: WHAT THE SCENE DOESN'T NEED

$20 events. Unless you're providing something outstanding above and
beyond: A two day event, food, 3 sound rooms + lasers, substantial
portion of profits donated to food not guns or other charitable org,
etc. Malachy refused to allow a $20 admission to his own benefit. Why?
Because he felt raves shouldn't cost $20.

SS security guards. If your security can't be briefed about what the
event is about, and what message you're trying to send, and if they
can't acknowledge that, fire them. Find someone that will. Or don't
hold the event. The scene will survive with smaller parties. We don't
need goons with attitude at the door. This is not a Hells Angels
rally.

Unreasonable confiscations. Don't confiscate anything that is not a
weapon. You're not worried about drugs. If you were, you'd invite K9
units to come sniff them out. If you want to confiscate something,
verify that liquids aren't alcohol. Booze is the only drug around
consistently linked with violence.

The same old name DJs over and over. I don't go to a lot of events
_because_ they have all big name DJs, and I know other people who feel
the same. I like to hear new stuff--people branching way out there and
doing their own thing. The big name DJs are fantastic, but they're not
all that there is, and after 60 or 70 events, one wants a little more
variety, eh? Yeah yeah I know--it affects the "draw". But at the same
time, I don't think the big promoters are trying very hard to
seriously use new talent. And I'm wondering why.

I'm really starting to lose faith in the bigger parties, in the same
old same old. Maybe logistics just doesn't make it possible to do big
parties and offer new talent in a friendly venue. If so, I welcome
more small parties and outdoor parties where low overhead will perhaps
allow a purity of purpose. I certainly hope to get involved and help
some of those free parties happen.

I absolutely agree.  We happened to stop by at about 1:30 and it 
was small, but the music was good, and the booths were so comfortable, 
they made the best chill out spot for me.

 The last Atomic Rooster went off well. :-) The crew gathered
 in the north parking lot right a little before five, by
 fivethirty sound checks had begun. Then with the sun low in 
 the sky M put on some Future Sound of London to take us to six
 when she started her set. M was maybe ten minutes into her set
 when a staffer arrived and asked us to shut down (something to do
 with the generator) but indicated that when the show started at 
 seven we could take our chances then. Well we held out untill
 about ten to seven before we decided to crank up the power and 
 go again. M began with at twilight with a beautiful, etherial,
 deep, well it MIGHT be the mothership landing, set and people
 started drifting over. M's set was short as she wanted all the djs
 to get a chance to spin, so within the half our Ethan got on the
 tables and dropped in a beat over M's ambient. The crowd grew and
 Ethan took off on a teriffic acid trance set. An hour or so later the 
 crowd was darn good sized and kickin'it up. Ethan was nearing the end
 of his set and checking around for the next dj, hummm none to be seen
 we discussed stratagies on the next move the only one viable being
 Ethan playing both sides of all his records if nessasary. As luck
 would have it five minutes later Garth and some friends appeared
 next to one of the stacks. We asked him if he'd brought his records
 and if he'd like to spin next, he graciously accepted. Ten 
 minutes later Ethan was winding up and Garth was mixing in and 
 continued mixing untill about 12:15.   And I'm hear to tell you,
 if you need to stretch the muscles, rattle the bones, add some 
 positive energy to the mind, body and soul. Dr. Gil heartly recomends
 a three and a half hour Garth treatment. YaHoo! About half way through
 Garths set the Dead show let out and the crowd size about doubled, 
 there was a bunch of people there, dancing and smiling all over the
 place. From begining to end I think all climbed the ladder and came
 to ground to dance together several times during the night,
 thank you all, with a big thanks to Garth for his time and timing.
 The music ended abruptly when staffers shut off the generator.
 They were firm and abrupt but not hostile. We learned that we picked
 the right spot to set up, if we had been in the middle of the lot they
 would have shut it down fortyfive minutes earlier and that at twelve
 its time to start winding down. The staffer that P-ter talked with
 was impresed with the sound system, the one I talked with liked the
 music and said if not working he'd a been dancing with us, so I don't
 think we have offiaial blessing but we do have official tolerance :-)
 so I think they expect to see us again. But there won't be another 
 Atomic Rooster. Thats because the next time this will happen will be
 in Febuary the last night of the Deads Chinese New Years shows and it 
 will be the year of the dog. So there will be an Atomic Dog. (woof!)
 We'll keep you posted.

 Gil

 P.S. I'm not a real doctor I only pretend to be one on the net (what
     can I say my dog has an account too).

went to space lab on thursday....it was quite nice and relaxed...lots of
fun people...ysh didn't go off boo hoo ...rumor has it i saw mr.
behlendorf dancing to some hardtrance (please send all flames to
susie@sutro.sfsu.edu ehehhe)

on sat night i went to the ibeam...it seems that they can't rent it out so
the owner is reopening it up...this is the first time i have ever been in
it...cuz it is 21+ it is a cool place with history reeking from the halls
and the biggest disco ball i have ever seen...i guess the ameba people are
getting involved with the reopening too...hmm lets wait and see...

 ok lets just face it gathering sucked...

1.  the twenty dollar thing would not have bugged me but when they charge
$15 before a certian time... i mean how bogus...then raise the price...that
is a cruddy little "gimmick" and i kept wondering how "gimmick" fits in
with what was written on the marquee "peace and love"

2.  i understand that promoting parties is WAY difficult...but i really
saw nothing there that was special...*well the laser was REALLY COOL
but monotomous after a while*...*well the free water was cool too*...but i
think it lacked vibe...i mean it felt like a large club...no special
things in the chillout (not even something to sit on)...

3. also the lighting was very very poor...on the dance floor all anyone had
to see was 3 projects way up high and a laser...and the klutz that i am
!!! i kept tripping on all the stairs and ramps...and that was too
anoying...also i like to be able to see peoples faces so i can see them
smile(and so they can see my smile)...some light ie an intellebeam or whatever
just for a little colorful sparkle would have been nice...(the blacklight
lit posters were pretty but not close enough to the dance floor (and you
weren't allowed within like 10 feet of them) to be counted as a source of
light...and anyways i assume for a twenty dollar party that they
have the budget to do nifty lighting...

4.  the sound was bad in someplaces and great in others *thanx to rocky
for making us go place to place to hear all the different qualities* 

5. some good sets and bad sets when off...

6. the concourse is a fun place...it is in the city with a lot of space
(yeah) but those damm security...i like bgp security better than the
concourse security...the security kept wanting us to get away from the
door area...WHY? i wanted to hang near the door cuz there was fresh air,
light, and it was a tad quieter so i could chat for a few moments and
"connect" with people...

i hope that the gathering people can learn and take notes from this party
*and maybe use the profits from this one to improve the next party* and that
the next one will have serious a groove!

well i left at 3:30 just cuz it wasn't happening...

on sunday i went to the grateful dead show...it was quite fun...a friendly
cool funky vibe...missed atomic rooster by about 10 minutes booo hoo...it
would have been nice to see two bohimian movements come together...
it was kinda neat yet hard to accept the dead as being progressive and not
regressive *i think i am classic rock phobic*...but they had a nifty light
show and tons of mindi's and computers!!!! and the people are so facinating!

one thing i liked was the volleyball court...i think i will bring a
volleyball to the next party i go to...heehehhe

oh and it felt really strange and warped to be hitchhiking a ride home
"to the haight-ashbury" (:(:

Well I thought the Gathering was great despite the 20 dollar admission.  The
party was big, with people cheering and shouting.  Everyone I ran into was
friendly and nice; I had no rpoblems with the security at all; upstairs
chill space was cool.  Tony was brilliant and the laser was awesome.

I'm not really sure what people are complaining about.  As far as I'm 
concerned, the Gathering promised a big, rocking party and it delivered.

But don't let that stop you from listening to 24 hours of great music! I see
your point, there should be a little more diversity, but still...

Geoff, first of all, it was a joke...my excuse is that I just came back to San
Francisco last night...I go to UCLA and I was in the middle of finals so I did
not read the list for at least two weeks.  I didn't mean to rile you up, as I
said, it was just a joke.

	Sean, why is it that you've taken such a carmudgeonly approach
to parties recently?  It's like you've become the Ralph Nader of the
rave scene.  I don't disagree that parties that rub you the wrong way
don't deserve your money, but it seems like so many times you're
willing to base your opinion of how good or bad a party is going to be
by things like security, price, etc - things which are somewhat
important, but usually only have to be deal with for a short amount of
time, and when I think of good parties I've been to, I don't think,
"damn, they had friendly security".  And to me, the above complaint
just seems like a negative approach to what you see as a problem.
Yes, there are no female DJ's on that list.  How do we know none were
asked?  How do we know?  Yes, there are some terrific female DJ's 
out there, but if you're gonna call up and complain about that, you
should also elect never to go to parties with all-male DJ's, never
shop at record stores without female employees, etc.  Maybe KSZU
fucked up by not putting more emphasis on getting a female DJ.  Maybe
they tried and none were available.

	I'm not saying you should ignore what you perceive as bad, but
it just seems like your threshold is really low, and the effect is
that you spread negativity around.  You based your ENTIRE review of
the Gathering around the fact that you made the CHOICE not to go in.
That's s just really unfair - most people only had to deal with the
security and front area for a minute or two before they got in.  I
mean, listen to Mike Romo, who said it was great.  His simple comment
meant more to me than your 5 page whining about not going in did.

	To everyone else - maybe this should have been personal mail,
but I don't think he's the only one who does this - if YOU went to
the Gathering and had a good time, POST about it!  Those of us who
couldn't go (like me) wanna know how it *really* was.  Remember when
reviews of parties used to be based on each DJ's sets, on the setup
of the speakers, on the friendliness of the crowd?  Now it's "well,
the security guard patted me down, so I decided not to go in".

	Okay, I got that off my chest.

	Brian

On the same token, what is wrong with him posting about him having a BAD time?
I personally would like to know the good as well as the bad. 

> Those of us who

Open your eyes. The parties are not always as perfect as you would like to 
think they are. I think you should respect Sean's right to voice the concerns
that are important to him.

The fact that several people post reviews gives a more balanced view of the
party so that those of us who weren't there have a better idea of how it was.
It sounded to me like the Gathering was awful from just reading Sean's posts so
I am glad to read reviews from people that said they had a good time. Not
everyone is going to have an equally good/bad time at these things, so I think
you should keep that in mind and let people post what they feel.

(whoah, she's ranting today!)

Diversity is good, and all, but once it starts making us become too aware

Ok, not enough good posts about the Gathering, well here it goes...
I had the most amazing time!  I haven't had that much fun at a rave in
about ....  well, a long time.   Yes, the security sorta was anoying, and
$20 is quite a large amount of money, but I expected that from the 
concourse.  That is unavoidable at the concourse.

Anyway, after I went in, I knew it would be a great night... It has been 
almost a year since I have been at the concouse, so I liked the memories 
that came along with being there...  Not only the memories, but also seeing
so many of my friends that I haven't seen in about a year...  It was like
a huge reunion..  Anyway, I had the most amazing time...

The music was amazing... I couldn't stop dancing for hours... It has been
a long time since I have went off like that.  I went off, and so did every
body around me.. Everybody was happy and screaming at times... Yes,
there was a lot of speed =-( but somehow the vibe around me, at least, was
not affected.  I was a little disappointed at the face that people still 
haven't wisened up...  Oh, and that is supposed to ^^^ spell fact. =-)

I did see the bad aspects of the party, but I went to this one prepared
to deflect any negativity, and spread all of the positivity that was in me...
I know the PERFECT party is almost impossible to come by, especially that
big of one, but I now try to make the best of any situation, and did it 
successfully at this one...  I had a great time!

Brian came out with some pretty strong criticism of what I write,
which kind of surprises me. A lot of people have responded to my posts
with email, and the response is overwhelmingly positive and
supportive.

In response to my Gathering post, some of the supportive email I got
(before your reply):

   "sean... i want to thank you for you encouragment and support of
   the the scene.  we need people like you to keep the whole scene
   going.  the scene will never die but without the outspoken support
   of people like you it will degrade to something which people like
   you and me will no longer want to be apart of"

   "Just wanted to say I enjoyed your analysis of the events of last
   Saturday..."

   "I really admire your comments about the lack of women djs on the
   KZSU (?) program and the shabby/sleaze-greedy treatment at the
   gates of the two recent raves you almost went to!"

And so on. I post this not to toot my own horn (I haven't done nearly
enough for the scene to toot anything), but to let you know there are
people out here who think I am passing on meaningful information,
enough so to send me mail and tell me.

Well lets take a look at it. There are a lot of things security and
price and age restrictions may have nothing to do with. Things like:

DJ performance.
Quality of visuals.
Free food or water.
Quality of sound system.
"The vibe".

I wouldn't be so arrogant as to review these things without actually
attending ;), and I didn't. So what does security and price and age
restrictions have to do with anything?

For some people, like me, it's hard to get over an initial bad
experience with security. Raves aren't mega-concerts, they're about
togetherness and a lot of intangibles--intangibles that promoters
often support in their flyers and their voice-mail and by word of
mouth. So when one goes to an event, one goes with a Woodstock-like
feeling, an eagerness to connect, to be a part of.

This good attitude, these good vibes, are often shattered when we get
to the door and find we are in a police state. NO REENTRY. NO
EXCEPTIONS. We're taking the water you so thoughtfully brought along.
Why? Because we are. No backpacks. You can't bring in that swiss army
knife. MAKE UP YOUR MIND OUTSIDE. NO! NO! NO! NO! No room for
negotiation. No cooperation. You are a criminal before the fact. DO
NOT.

Brian, a lot of people hate that as much as I do. If you can come up
with something to do about it that's effective, I'm willing to put
some hours into making phone calls, or doing whatever. Until then, I
think it's important to relate my experience. I consider it warning
others, and perhaps some food for thought for the promoters that read
this.

When I went to C2, I had such a good experience with the security that
I actually did give them a good review. It shows it _can_ be done
without excessive attitude and lack of cooperation.

What does money have to do with it? Probably not a lot if you're
making $30,000 a year. Most of my friends are so poor, they can't
afford a $20 event. It comes out of their food money. Promoters won't
even put the price on the phone line. Instead, you have to find out
other ways, or drive there from places like Sacramento, find out it's
$20, and look at your friends trying to decide. Go in and eat ramen
noodles for 4 days, or call it all a waste of time?

Once again let me reiterate: Why did Malachy feel so strongly about
not charging $20 at his own benefit?

No, $20 doesn't have a lot to do with what happens inside, but it has
a lot to do with who goes inside. The same with age restrictions.

Maybe I did overreact. It just seemed shocking to me. I know seven
female DJs on a first name basis. I hardly ever see them at parties, I
know they would like to do them, and I know that promoters and other
DJs know about them. Your Sisters House was formed in part to help
promote women DJs as they're almost totally ignored by the scene at
large.

You're right. I have an agenda. And that's why I said I wanted to call
the radio station (I still intend to.) Whether or not the radio
station made any effort to get female DJs, I want them to make more of
an effort, until it actually happens. Thus the pressure. I apologise
for dragging the people on this list into that agenda.

In my defense I should say that my entire review of the Gathering was
about that choice, and it was never misrepresented as anything else.
Also, in my defense, you and I and everyone else knows that I have
written monumentally positive reviews of events I liked.

Yes, it was negative. The experience was negative. And as much as we
need positivity, I do think we need negative reviews when warranted.
*Especially* when it's due to greed, false claims, or a general lack
of concern about one's patrons.

Please, please don't ever accuse someone of whining. It belittles
them; it mocks their pain. It casts their issue as moot. It's a term I
very much dislike.

I have very obviously hit a nerve, but I'm still not sure why.

I don't think this is the norm now. There are issues that need to be
dealt with. But I and other have posted a lot of good reviews. Just
remember that each person's experience is valid to them.

I truly respect your opinion Brian. If you feel I am being too
negative, then I guess I need to take a look at things and see if I
can do them a bit better.

Well, I thought the Gathering was great.

I mean, if you were to judge the music?  Yeah, it was great.  Jeno broke the
law again and Garth made sure we paid for it.  And what's up with Tony, anyway?
 How did he get Better?

Anyway, sure it was $20.  I haven't gone to anything since the Basics in
Seattle, and this was totally worth the money.  I had no problems with Security
(but then, I never do.  Martin's parties always have free water, so I don't
bring a bottle).  They even had a COAT CHECK.  Come on, that's worth five bucks
alone just to have your stuff SAFE. 

The space was great, the hangings were great, and I pity the people who left
early--you missed the party with all the lights on, and after the music was
over, a woman started singing (not mic'ed) "We are family" and part of the
crowd sang with her.  That's perfect.  
The laser was not tedious, excuse me.  It was fantastic.  the balcony area was
fantastic, especially when they opened the roof and cooled down the building in
a really short time.  

And so many old faces with our new friends!  what a way to close the year, I
felt.  Lots of people dancing, lots sitting (nice to be able to do with that
carpet) and even two bathroom areas.

I mean, we all knew this would be a big party.  If you don't like big parties,
don't go.  If you don't want to pay $20 for the big party, don't pay $20.  Go
to a small one.  go home.  The sound was great, the vibe was good (the vibe is
hard to come by, I know, but it seems to come out more in the mornings these
days) and the music phenomenal.  I heard Spun went crazy.

So, that's my humble opinion.  I had a great time to the end.  I am very
curious to see how New Year's goes..

Merry Christmas, everyone.

Hi to all of the ravers out there!  I just want to add my $0.02
about the Gathering.  I went with about 16 other people, and all of
us had a GREAT time!!  The security people were cool (especially
after they received a couple of blow pops!), the music was
FANTASTIC, the chill out space upstairs was nice to have after
dancing for hours and hours, and the people were REALLY friendly!!
All in all, we had a great time!  Anyway, that's my $0.02.  Have a
GREAT holiday season!!

Well, I have to say that for once, I disagree with you, Brian.  Tamara's
reply is nicely stated, and personally, I also feel that posts about
security, price, and other general COMPLAINTS should be welcome.  So maybe
the scene is SUPPOSED to be about peace and love, but must we be
restricted to making positive posts?  If we think an event sucked, should
we just keep our mouthes shut?  Even if Sean never went in, I still think
his post was enlightening.  I read through his whole rant, which is
something I usually avoid.

In the case of the Gathering, I think we pretty much know from the start
what the music, crowd, etc. is going to be like, because we've ALL been to
Martin's events and they are ALL the same.  The same DJ's, the same sound
system (usually), the same blacklight posters.  The space will change, but
rarely is it a NEW space (I'm sure most of us have been inside the
concourse at one time or another).  I don't go out very often anymore, but
even if I have not gone out for months, and I go see Garth or Jeno spin,
it just seems like the same old same old to me.  They often stick to the
EXACT same songs, which really annoys me.  You'd think with the hundreds
of new records that come out each week, they would be able to change
their rotation a bit.  And to tell you the truth, paying twenty
bucks for an event will often ruin my night, because I will be
disappointed if it doesn't live up to its price (as is usually the case). 
Soooo... to return to the point, I welcome posts like Sean's.  His
impressions are as valid as anyone else's. 

I went out to SpaceLab on Thursday, and found it to be quite refreshing. 
The crowd was small and friendly, the cover was CHEAP ($3 before 12), and
the for the most part, the music was GREAT, especially Alex from Gaia
Mantra, who laid down some seriously brain crushing rhythms (not
necessarilly fast, just sick, harsh, repetetive, trance-inducing beats). 
These people are not making any money from this event, they're putting it
on because WE NEED MORE TECHNO in San Francisco!!!  It costs them $300 to
rent out just the upstairs of the Trocadero (the space they use), and I
doubt if they had one hundred paid admissions.

Martin makes money.  I know he has put a lot of effort into his events
over the years, but the fact is, he's making money.  I'm not saying he
doesn't deserve it, but it seems like, now that he's reached a certain
level of success, he could avoid the $20 cover and the shit-for-brains
security.  And his "personal" plea to sfravers to attend was merely
advertising.  Brian, I don't know why you felt it was necessary to forward
his message, when we ALL new about the Gathering already.  

Anyway, enough said.  I think this qualifies as my first sfrave rant. 
Thanks for taking the time to read it.  Positive AND negative replies

Come to Your Sisters' House on Thursday, January 13.  I will be there
with a crate of techno.  145 bpm acid trance, here we come!

For those of you looking for funk/house/tribal/or anything else, I
can guarantee that one of the other women will provide something
you will enjoy, so come anyway even if you can't stand techno.

P.S. This is an invitation to each and every one of you.  I don't have

In regards to Seth's post:

Weren't people complaining about not getting personal invitations?  I thought
Martin was actually inviting people to come.  Sure we all knew, but as was
previously discussed, "knowing" just isn't enough, people want to be i n v i t
e d  these days.  So, Seth, just because "we all knew about it" doesn't mean
that Martin couldn't invite us.  Come on.

Jeno and Garth do change their records.  I have a feeling that if they didn't,
they wouldn't be so popular.  These guys are popular because they are really
good.  And if you hear the same songs, chances are you don't MIND, becuase the
song is so good ANYWAY.

DOES SF need more Techno?  I remember the days of last summer and the great
tribal phase...I personally get tired of tweeky techno music.  But that's my
opinion.

Oh, and please, Martin makes SOME money, but this is his first party that MIGHT
have turned a profit, believe me.  After the Basics, the Awaken, and some of
the other parties that he has thrown that have failed, I am surprised he is
still throwing them.  And besides, it's not just Martin behind the Gathering. 
Harry has a great deal to do with it, as do others.

We all seem to be jumping from one high horse to another today.  sorry if my
horse got in anyone else's way.

Martin has as much right to "personally" invite us to his parties as anyone
on this list does; we all advertise in our own way. In fact, a great deal
of recent feedback I received suggested--repeatedly-- that I needed to
advertise more. Trying to bring a widespread and diverse scene together
under one roof is a difficult task. I don't like $20 parties either, but
having the guts to invest tens of thousands of dollars in a party is not an
easy thing to do; do you want to take that kind of a risk? I don't. 

Unfortunately, many big venues have their own security which are part of
the deal; you can try and get them to respect the vibe you're trying to
create, but often they are just indivduals who get stressed out from trying
to deal with 2700 people each with their own story about: lost their ID,
lost their wallet, on the guest list etc. I think that massives always
entail a certain loss of that personal touch that we all notice; from a
practical perspective I am not sure how much you can do about it. Make no
mistake though; if security at the Gathering was rude it was not because
martin wasn't paying attention or didn't care.

Personally, I think Martin does massives better than anybody--bar none; and
I for one am glad he's doing them, cos I like them; and, *I know* that
Martin loves this scene with all his heart, whether or not it makes him
money, and quite often it doesn't.

Just my $.02

I certainly wasn't very impressed with the Gathering.  In my dim memory
I think I may have been to one about two years ago, but no matter.
Consider:

The phone message said $15, but when I laid down my Jackson I didn't get
a Lincoln back.  

The security zoofs shooed Susie, Brycer and me away from the entrance.
Of course, we were standing at least 60 feet away from the entrance at the
time, and were actually around a corner not blocking anyone's path.

I missed Doran's set (turns out he was rescheduled from 12:30 am back
to 11 pm), but Tony and Garth did a decent job on the tables.

However, just as things seemed ready to take off around 3:30, a *flood*
of young toughs washed through the place and the vibe just sagggggggggged.

The music (presumably Jeno at that point) matched the vibe.  I left at 5:15.

The place is pretty nice.  Organized a little differently it could be a
wonderful massive get-down get-off.  But quite frankly, $40,000 went into
the tills Saturday night and I don't really feel we saw a 40-K quality
event.

Props to whoever put out recycling barrels near the front.  First time
ever in SF that I've seen anyway.  Now how about putting trash/recycle
receptacles at various accessible locations throughout, to help minimize
floor trash.  

The sound and visuals in the main room were decent.  I didn't hang in the
ambient area for long.

If ya want a rating, I'd give the event a C+.  Not nearly my expectation,
that's for sure.

Sean is spot-on with his observations about the Gathering.  Once you pay
your $20 and ignore the demeaning ritual of obnoxious security insulting
you, life is good, joyous, and free.  But what if $20 is a big deal and
you don't enjoy being insulted, and this makes the whole ball of 
happy throbbing going on inside seem just a bit hollow and contingent?

This has been my experience at massives.

If we keep paying too much for events with demeaning rituals of entry, 
we will continue to be demeaned, because the people who throw these
events won't change unless they have to -- which will only
happen if we refuse to support them by paying them money.

The joy of ecstatic dance should not be predicated on willingness to
submit to the consumer ritual.  It becomes just another commodity to
be bought, sold, and thrown away, just another bandwagon to jump on
and later abandon in search of the next bought thrill, and the essence
is gone.  If we don't care enough to make things work better,
they're not going to get better, and we have only ourselves to blame,
because we settled for something that was "good enough".

"So what", you ask?

I've been to excellent events with NO security AT ALL.  Positive Force-DC
throws punk massives all the time, and they never hire security.
Fugazi played to several thousand in SF with no security.  I've helped
throw four-hundred person co-op parties -- no security.

If you have a true community, hiring security guards is not necessary.
The massive promoters are always talking about how much of a community
we are.  Well, if we're such a community, it's time for them to walk
the walk and show their trust in us.  Otherwise, it's time to admit
that large mersh raves are just another big money scam.  They can be
fun, but they're not a community, and we are not family -- just another
bunch of trendies to be milked for their cash.

Let's get something straight. I don't have objections to big name DJs.
I get into a Jeno groove just as much as the next person.

It just kind of bothers me that at big events, it's always the same
DJs--the same DJs even that were spinning when I found the scene in
March. How often do new DJs get a chance to play a big event? Some of
them are _incredible_ with their talent.

One is reminded of commercial radio. They play the same stuff over and
over again, while struggling new artists with great talent are
ignored. People like me who want to hear really good stuff have to
have a lot of friends who like music, have to scour Usenet for
reviews, and have to spend a lot of time simply hunting down releases
on very small labels.

Perhaps I am just disillusioned. Perhaps it's impossible to put 1/3
non-huge-name DJs in your lineup and not lose your mortgage. Is that
really the case?

I like big events once in a while. They can be a hell of a lot of fun.
And I hope that someday promoters can find room for some of the new
talent that's out there.

Okay, well, I should have done this before, but I'd like to go through
your post point by point and really show you why I think this 
"critique" of the Gathering is unfair.

On Dec 20,  1:59pm, you proclaimed:
} The big sign says: NO REENTRY NO EXCEPTIONS.
}
} Strike one. This is not necessary at raves. It might be fine for a two
} hour concert, but not for an 8+ hour event. People need to be able to
} leave, eat, and return. It's also nice just to be able to escape from
} the space for a while (I'm claustrophobic).

I don't share this view.  I think of all the massives I've been to, and
I've never really had the need to leave the space for any reason.  I
bring water or whatever in with me, and I stay and enjoy myself.  And
I'd find it really hard to be claustrophobic inside the Concourse.

} We go in and talk to the cashiers:
} 
} "How late is the event going to run?"
} "Six to six-thirty."
} 
} Hmmmm I think, that's only 5 hours from now. I was expecting more like
} 10am.

Most massives end around 7 - only when they're outdoor do they go until
10 or 11.  I'm sure if Martin had his way it would go on until noon :)

I would have headed over about 11pm anyways.

} "How much?"
} "Twenty dollars."
} 
} Strike two.
} 
} Twenty dollars? I thought the day of the 20 dollar rave was over. I
} guess not. Well, I can afford twenty dollars, but I don't wanna. Greg
} can't afford twenty dollars, not really. But we have twenty dollars
} each with us so we start talking about it. Hmmm there's only 5 hours
} left. Maybe I can get a discount? So I go talk to the cashier.

As Ethan pointed out before, it's a big risk to rent the Concourse and
throw parties of that scale.  And when you think about it - how much
do other forms of entertainment cost?  How much did Exotic Erotic
cost?  How much does Great America cost?  I, for one, am willing to
pay $20 for 7 hours of a really rockin' party.  And there are lots of
other people like that, too.  Actually, had you gone before 11 then it
would have been $15 (I think that's how it was being done..).  If so,
your decision to stay at home until 1am created strike one and two.

} We decided that if it's that fucked up outside, the promoter probably
} doesn't give a shit about us once he's got our money. So we decided to
} take it elsewhere, to not support Nazi security, expensive parties,
} and inflexible promoters.

This paragraph just incredibly rubbed me the wrong way.  Had you
gone at 11pm with $15 in hand, none of this would have happened and 
you conceivably could have had a great time inside.  Instead, you
decided to base your opinion of the party and the promoter on
things they may have had no control over.  I don't care how many
people thanked you for this post, it just screamed to me of
prejudice and ego. 

I would have given your "critique" a LOT more credibility had you
actually gone inside and not liked it, like Phred.

Don't rate the restaurant if you haven't tried the food.

is a BIG difference between throwing large parties at legal spaces
with their own security and way of doing things, and smaller parties
in random places.  Sean's critique would have a lot more relevance if

Should we petition for Disney to cut its admission charges?  The economics
of large parties does mean that there's a significant financial difference
between $15 and $20, one that wouldn't be compensated by more people who
could afford the $15 but not the $20.  And the "shit-for-brains" security
is part of the reason why he is able to have so many large, legal parties,
where NO ONE has gotten hurt from alcohol or gun play.  In my mind it's
a necessary evil, and if it's really a problem go to a party without
security.

security and such is a problem sometimes.

The point is that he has this view.

BUT...I absolutely respect your right to express YOUR view as well.

I can understand why some people have a need to escape the space for a while.
A nice chill out room might be a good way to at least mitigate a situation
where there are no ins and outs.

> Don't rate the restaurant if you haven't tried the food.

But, if the restaurant seems a little weird or tense or fishy, you would
decide not to dine there.

I would like to hear Martin's views on this. I am not one to instantly blame
the promoter. I have had some good times at his events. Maybe some of the
negative aspects of the party that Sean encountered were things that Martin
did not have control over.

A nice soundbite. Did you read my reply? My posting was never
misrepresented as something that happened in the Gathering. Are you
thinking with your head, or only in terms with your friendship to
Martin?

One can justify, justify, justify, but that doesn't change the bottom
line that security was treating customers like guano, that the event
was expensive, etc. What's your message, Brian? That we're supposed to
be happy with it? Sure, sometimes it's outside the promoter's control.
And if we _can't_ have parties without that, a lot of us just aren't
going to go. But a lot of us think it can happen, and we want to send
a clear message that we want it to happen.

Someone else wrote me:

    "...The $15 before 10, and ??? after that was what kept me away. I
    knew it would be $20 after 10, but that little trick was kind of
    bad vibe for me.  Led me to expect the rest of what you said
    above.  For me things need to start well, if they don't I have
    trouble getting off of the negative wave.  Character flaw, I
    suppose. :()"

A lot of people are unhappy with it too. Saying "You should like
this." isn't going to make them like it. Telling them "If you don't
like it, don't go." is really rude. Implicit in that statement is
"Don't complain." Please don't tell people they shouldn't complain.
Not unless you're willing to tell them not to give praise either.

Sean

Subject: Re: The Gathering Feud (was: 24 Hrs. of HOUSE MUSIC(play list))
Status: 

I want to make it clear: I have no objection to large parties and the
compromises that must be made to pull them off.  I used to put on concerts
and I know all about what you have to go through to put on events with
50, 500 and 5000 people attending.

It's also true that attendance is down somewhat, which raises the pressure
to keep ticket prices up.  After all, once you're already there the $5
extra isn't likely to make a diff.  What I objected to was that I don't
recall any notice of a price raise after a time certain on the phone
message.  And it is certainly arguable that there have been plenty of
other parties which cost that much and more, and sometimes they deliver
less.  I remember particularly a Turtle Wax at the Troc about a year ago
where I was very hesitant to lay out $20 and then went in and watched my
mind gyrate somewhere out between here and Alpha Centauri.

Then there was Cyberfest.  My mind never left the dustt on the ground for
that one :!  So you takes yer picks and yer chances.

I was over at 3rd Floor yesterday and saw a bunch of UK flyers for events
of the holiday season.  Like here, they all emphasize the groovee aspects
(actually there's more hype there even on the small flyers).  And the
promos for the Gathering were hype-less, basically, so that's a positive
aspect to mention.

But again, if you're taking in $30 or $40K for the evening, and given the
prospect of losing dough bigtime if your event gets sandbagged by other
promoters, the weather is bad, raver fickleness goes to Stun, &c., I still
think it's time for large parties to take a more innovative approach.
And it's also well past time to work on making security a more humane and
less authoritarian service.  I stand by every word of the rant I wrote about
that last spring when Brian asked for feedback for the Monday meetings.

As for complaints about the lineup, the UK crew, and all that, there may
be something to it but after considering all the aspects of it and hearing
from many different points of view, I have to conclude that much of the
complaining is sour grapes.  Martin and Wicked helped put the UK sound and DJs
on the map in SF and added a whole new dimension to the scene here when they
did.  They have been successful for a variety of reasons, one of which is
an approach to building DJ name recognition.  I see nnothing particularly
wrong with that.  I like many of the UK-origin DJs, and many of our domestic
variety :)  It's like saying that it's unfair that UK vinyl dominates the
racks at BPM, Tweekin', Music Now or wherever.  Fact of the matter is that
a lot of good stuff is coming from there because of the much larger (and
quite a bit more commercial) nature of the scene there.  

The biggest p trap here continued to be overbroad generalizing, in my mind.,
"San Francisco only likes house.  The east coast only likes hardcore and
gabber.  **** is God.  **** sucks.  King St. is Mecca.  King St. is Hell.
If I hear Robin S one more time I'm gonna hurl.  If I hear Robin S one more
time I'm gonna fly."
 
This is not to say there aren't valid generalizations that can be made.
I think it's generally the case that 1993 was a good year for music -- the
quality of the vinyl I'm hearing (adjusted for time delay, familiarity and
local wind speed ;) is better and the selection broader than a year ago.
But it was also a year that the vibe slipped off track in a lot of ways.
Much of it was predictable, some things like Malachy's accident weren't.
I had a GOOD time this year so I tend to see it as an inevitable and
difficult transition period.  Rave is dead; long live rave.  It's all
future dance music to me now, anyway.  And the reason to do it remains the
same -- the vibe, the feeling, the adventure.

Happy Holidays, everyone!  Not a whole lot this weekend, as people
seem to be preparing for New Year's Eve.  Thursday's Your Sisters'
House lineup looks great and might be the highlight of the weekend.
Go and cheer on our own trance@netcom! 8-)

I'm not sure if all of the weeklies will be happening X-mas Eve and
on X-mas, so you'd better call the numbers before you plan your evenings.
But Saturday is another Wicked, and hopefully on Tuesday, we can
celebrate the roundness of the moon.

This is coming out a bit early, so if anyone picks up any other flyers
for this weekend, please post them!

I'm not against big, I'm against demeaning.  The Fugazi show in SF was
(like I said) nearly as big as the Come/Unities in Richmond, and there
were random show volunteers taking tickets (including some people from
924 Gilman, which is a volunteer-run club) and no security inside, and
everything went off amazingly.  It CAN be done, folks.  Believe it.

I do my best (PW, Solstice, Planet 6 @ Burning Man), but I'm from San
Jose and don't have full vehicle access, and I work during the week,
so I can't make all the great weeklies sixty miles away in SF.  I'll
be at Motion this week, and I have hit Deep Space before, but I also
have mixed feelings about 21+.  I wanted desparately to hit Liquid Air
after the Orb but my buddy with the transpo flaked out and I couldn't
convince him how cool it was going to be.

I didn't.  I am explaining why, and pointing out that other scenes have
addressed those problems.

cop basically asks "any weapons?" "no" "any drugs?" "no" "okay have a 
good time." That's it! Maybe they'll search someone or look through a 
backpack or purse, but that's it. No water/candy/pen confiscations, no 
attitude. I would guess police have a little better idea of security than 
the rent-a-cops. Maybe they should take a lesson.

Hell, from the attitude of some of the police we've dealt with, it almost 
seems like some of them enjoy working these things. Where else are yo 
going to get a thousand people together for several hours without fights? 
They seem to realize that we are reasonably intelligent and responsible 
folks (even with our um...er...drug usages) and don't need to be coddled 
and protected from each other. Rental security and promoters take a note!

Well, looks like Your Sister's House is cancelled this week, due to it being

At least it saved me from having to call them and cancel out since I have the

BUT... I PERSONALLY invite you all to come to YSH on January 6th. :)

Something was tried out on the East Coast that has met with great success:
have 1/3 to 1/2 the bill be "unknowns" and the rest be "well-loveds."  To
wit, I have spun on the same bill as Frankie Bones, Josh Wink, Ritchie
Hawtin, and Guy DMC, and the parties definitely didn't suffer for it.

Well, it's an idea.

Some of these factors are completely out of our control..
The Concourse and Fashion Center come with their own security.
Nobody throws a party there without using their overpriced services..
No ins and outs are standard at almost_every event_ Ive been to
there..esp.recently.
Must have been 50 or so by now.. We all have.
This is a free country..we can choose to go or not go anywhere we like..

There really is something for everyone in this scene..

What is it,now that we're done criticising most of the _real_ money mongerers..
(and you notice that by now most of them are _blissfully_ out of business..)
we're just cynical and bored..  okay,so what?

WARNING: These are my OWN opinions, and not those of ANYONE ELSE who may be
INCIDENTALLY mentioned below!!!!
===============================================================================
I have read the entire littany of rubbish posted on the list most recently.
I really cannot belive what I am hearing.

First we hear Sean blast away about some items he finds apalling.  And
rightfully so (in his own mind, which is OK with me).  But you have got so
many things wrong my man....here...let me put it to you in numbers my man:

Concourse $10,000
Security  $ 3,000
DJ's      $ <$700 Jeno
            <$700 Garth
            <$600 Josh
            <$600 Tony
            <$500 Doran
            <$500 Carlos
          <$3,600  Total DJ Budget
Flyers   $  1,000
Visuals  $  <$500
Laser    $  <$300
Paintings$  <$300
Sound    $  2,000
Incidentals
         $    500
         =========
         $21,400    Total (@20 each mean 1070 for break even)

Rough estimate, and I did NOT talk to Martin (and never have) about his
finances.  I also know that there is a security deposit, cleaning fees, he
probably had to cough up bar fees, etc.  Staff is another consideration.
You could say that it is not inconceivable that the party cost near $30k to
do. Which brings it up to 1500 break even @ 20 each.  @15 each 1427 or 2000
depending on which figure you choose.

And this is why I HATE whiny ravers!

Blah, blah, nag, nag, me, me, mine, mine....that's all I have heard on the
list for some time.  Mostly from those who have NEVER had a vested interest
in doing anything but complaining.  Very, VERY, few have even tried todo a
party on their own, but have plenty of room to tell a promoter what he/she
needs to do to get their $10-$20 pryed from their tight assed wallets!

Secondly, a "promoter" goes on a serious financial limb to do something
that they *LOVE*  .  For  no other reason than this, would a promoter take
such a high risk, for such sketchy returns.  Many have greed in mind.  But
they are NOT currently throwing parties.  Martin is one of the VERY FEW,
who has kept things going in SF/Bay Area.

Martin RARELY throws $20 events.  He does $20 events during new years/4th
of july/halowwen/xmas time.  Thats POTENTIALLY 4 times out of the year!
Considering the number of parties he HELPS throw, and funds cooperatively,
he throws 10-15 additional parties a year.  This is not easy, and it takes
a toll.  Throughout all of this I have seen him make a couple of bucks, and
lose a few as well.  But he, above all else, believes,and I mean truly
believes, in what he s doing!!!  Which is alot more than I can say for
*some* of the promoters people of SFR have supported with their hard earned
bucks in the past!  Martin usually throws $10-$15 dollar parties.  And has
remained constant for TWO YEARS now.  Yeah, go to that f***ing old ass To*n
To*n rehash and get your ass ripped off.  They charged upward of $25/ticket
and $30 at the door for the events Martin normally charges $20 for, this
new years WILL bear me out (Supernogo is what I'm talkin for anyone
unaware!).

You'd think he's living pretty high on the hog, but that is not the case.
He lives modestly, because, for all you misinformed pissed off partygoers,
he makes a MODEST living.  He has not made what you THINK he's made.  SO
unless you're his bank, back off!!!

A promoter TRIES REALLY HARD to find spaces people are/will be comfortable
in.  SOmetimes spaces are not avail. so you make with what you find, cross
your fingers, and pray the people like what you've done in the past enough
to come to your show.  Unless you've risked the THOUSANDS, you would not
know the feeling.  It is MOST difficult to describe...

I am NOT the greatest fan of Martin's productions.  I wish he would do more
in certain areas.  But to his credit, it is MARTIN who gave me the idea of
four-corner system (which I gave to Preston, which gave to...you get it!).
Martin is SOLEY responsible for getting Tony out there and heard, as well
as Doran.  And Martin's last Gathering at that spot put Garth's skinny ass
on the map!  Just the facts, folx, just the facts.  And Martin consistently
books new talent that catches his ears.

He, for some odd reason, LIKES Lyon's securty.  And as obnoxious as they
are, they were MORE MELLOW than they have been at other times.

So funny, so friggin funny.  All these wimpy ass complaints...but did you
forget:
 - No ID's (it was an ALL AGES EVENT PEOPLE !!!)
 - Sealed WATER was allowed (keep ur water bottle and fill it up later).
 - The search was a pat down.  Some had more intrusive searches, but they
were very quick and cursory about it (read I got MY dope in!, and I went
thru the same line as others.)  Checks are done on everyone...even
"insiders" ;).
 - Pretty good sound, all things considered (getting better each party).
 - Good mix of folx (more Af. Am's, Latino's/Latina's/Hispanics, Asians,
Euro-Am's than at toher events of late).
 - Did not see a fight.
 - Wimmin were left alone pretty much.
 - Very, very few shirtless males.
 - Good music.
 - Uh, FREE WATER.
 - Drawing Table.
 - OK visuals (Martin is into the visuals he likes.  It IS his party that
he shares with others).

This is not to say that the party did not have it's bad points.  Security
previously noted.  But to pan a party because you could not strike a deal
is bunk.  Deal making is for kingpins, millionaires, or flea markets.
Unless you consider a rave any of these things, keep your bartering to
yourself!

Why $15 b4 xxxtime:  To show appreciation to those people who showed up
early.  In the early days of this madness, it was COMMON practice to let
the first few people in FREE.  It is difficult to do that now, so a
promoter may let people in for a reduced rate at a special time.  12-4 (and
more commonly 2-5) is PRIME TIME.   The DJ's should be putting people where
they need to be, and the party should be hitting explosive level.  And YOU
want a cut rate...jeez...wait till sunday, the flea market opens at 10:00
a.m. ;)  And BTW about this cut rate, bargaining rubbish, what makes ANYONE
so special that THEY think they should NOT have to pay what others have
GLADLY paid?  I just don't get it....If you cannot afford to go out, then
stay home.  But don't blame the promoter for treating you like he does ALL
his other patrons; EQUALLY (A word everyone loves to use, but HATES to
apply)!!!

(BTW guest listed people were ASKED to pay a $5.00 donation to Mal.  I gave
willingly!!!  And I've paid at PLENTY of other M.O'Brian productions!)

Sean et al have some fine points about what disturbed them about the party.
Although I disagree with the pretense under which they are based, he has
his own ideas about the way things should be done.  Promoters should
listen...

But maybe they will lsiten if you do your own thang, do it consistently,
and show them the way...only through demonstation can certain points be
made.  If one is so cocksure then do a production, take the risk
(consistently), and let them know how things are to be done....

Enough,
John


P.S.  I do NOT like $20 parties.  I try to stay away from them.  M. really
had very little choice but to do what he did.  Considering his past, and
what he's given back (more than MOST), he deserves success!!!

Subject: big name DJ's? (long)
Status: 

Another one of my pet peeves with the rave crusaders (you know who you are ;):
"I don't like big name DJ's"

This is understandable, but IMO, impractical.  Here is a very simple test.
I'll take ANY 6 of you who do not like big name DJ's, any six.  Now EACH of
you GIVE me $1,000 dollars, I'll pitch in $1,000 for good measure.  Let's
make damn sure the DJ's are not known in this locale.  We'll take that
$7,000 and do a full on production, promote like hell, etc.  Now guess, how
many people, LIKE YOURSELF, do you know?

Invite them to HEAR this new talent.  Did we at least make enough to do
another party with some other non big name DJ's (fuck profit, let's break
even!)?
Are you WILLING to part with $1,000 of your dollars to do it?  Well?

The FACT is the big name DJ's are TALENTED!  Something new DJ's have, but
are nuturing (that's why you call them new, non?).  It takes time to build
up a selection of records, and time to learn how/when/what/who to spin.  It
takes time to learn to work a crowd.  And it takes time to get out enough
to hear what you like, as well as time building relationships, etc.

As for the "Big Name" DJ's: They are ALL THAT because they can whip the
shit out of most newcomers.  People are very familiar with what they can
do, and they can really work a crowd.  It is a completely diferent thing to
do a 150 people party versus something 3 to 10 times as large.  It is NOT
the same thing, and each of us KNOWS this.  When you invest TENS of
THOUSANDS of dollars (that you may or may NOT have at the moment) in an
event, the LAST thing you want is people feeling they have not gotten what
they came for, pumped music from a DJ who can do the do. Or people not
coming because they are unfamiliar with the names (there was a time for
this...it has passed, people like familairity sometimes).

The PROBLEM with big name DJ's is their attitude.  There IS a certain
"posse" BS that runs the gamut here in SF, most notably with the lads from
across the Atlantic.  No big deal, but they are VERY concsious of who they
are booked with, etc.  I hate that shit... but that is not my problem.
Many DJ's will not put for their best efforts when spinning for a party
they do not care about.

I thought Jeno's set was good, but not his best.
I thought Garth's set was OK, but not his best.

Tony, remarkable!!!
Josh, incredible!!!

I did not hear Carlos, or Doran...wish I did!

I have YET to hear Garth and Jeno do anything as good as they do at
Wicked's or FMM's.  Sorry, but that's what *I* hear when I listen to them
(spin) outside of their party. And that is UNFAIR to everyone.  And I can
see why people get turned off by the , uh, "majors".

Markie, for some odd reason, is on a roll...as well as many others.

Women DJ's just don't promote their shit enough...there are male DJ's who
are at fault as well, but they don't spin...so...promotion IS/CAN BE an
equalizer.

I recently wanted to hear a female DJ that was mentioned as a booking
possibility for me.  I asked for something VERY simple...a tape.  I got,
"well, she does not have one...", well what am *I* to do?  Book her
willy-nilly without even hearing her?....suicide!  That's what I mean.  If
female DJ's want the jobs, there are plenty of folx who would be more than
happy to book them, if they got heard that is.  And the FRIENDS of these
female DJ's can help, by promoting them to others as well.  Hell, carry a
tape, give it to someone who is in the market for new TALENT.  What a 60-90
minute tape can do fro one's possibilities.

So if you're tired of the same old...don't go!
If you know someone who can do better, promote 'em (better yet, let them
promote themselves!)!
And if all else fails...BUY SOME DECKS, SOME RECORDS, and START SPINNING!

Change starts with you,
John

Well, Mr. Lee, you seem to be contradicting yourself a bit here.  Are you
saying that your opinions are FACTS?  Hmmm... that's the feeling I get
from your posts.  Referring to the opinions of others as "whimpy ass
complaints" just seems to be seriously uncalled for.  I know you have OH
SO MANY big connections in the rave scene and you know OH SO MUCH about
it, but that doesn't warrant your slapping down personal insults.  I think
negative comments and rants have a place on this list, but what makes your
insults less "whimpy assed" than those you are insulting?  I dunno...

About Martin and big events, I personally feel that big rave events do not
keep the scene alive.  In fact, they may actually be helping to degrade it. 
Mainstream America has a reputation for RUINING good music/scenes/etc
which were once underground.  I have not once heard of an underground
movement which has improved after being accepted by the mainstream.  I
know, I know, the rave scene is already in the mainstream, so there's no
turning back.  I can't say I know how to "keep it alive" any more than the
next person, but I think that undergrounds and small parties, people like
Ethan, etc. are actually helping to keep it GOOD, not just "alive".  I
mean, who gives a shit if it's alive if it sucks?

As for new DJ talent, I'm one of them :)  Does Martin even accept tapes? 
I've got plenty lying around, and would be happy to distribute them.  Give
me the addresses/phone #'s I'll send 'em.  And for any others who are
interested, I'd be happy to send you one.  Just send me a couple of

Status: 

I agree with Laura,

We've had great success mixing the line up with well known DJ's and the
newer talent here in Seattle.  Occassionally, we also do parties with local
and mostly new talent and these have met with success as well.  I think
variety is the key here.  Sure, the big names do draw in a crowd.  However,
I think that most ravers are smart and open enough to appreciate good new
talent and different styles.  IMO infusion of new talent is essential to
keeping the scene alive, thriving and healthy.  The same goes not just for
DJ talent but for other people in the community who want to put together
parties and promote.  Seattle is not a big town and is hard put to support
more than one party on any given night but, I encourage people within our
community as well as people from outside (like Martin) to keep doing
parties because an infusion of new ideas and styles can only help to make
things better.  There's a need to make sure that a certain flow is
maintained towards progress.  A small flowing creek is much more appealing
than a large stagnant pond.

Peace!

Status: 

When someone throws a massive they have so much more to lose and so much more 
to gain than someone throwing an underground renegade.

To ensure that they won't end up in jail for non-payment of bills, or worse yet 
beaten up, the organizer of a large party needs to spend LOTS of money on 
promotion (I think JSL's $1000 estimate was low, actually, but maybe promotion
costs are less out in SF because you don't have such a large geographic area 
to cover), LOTS of money to ensure the space is guaranteed for the night, LOTS 
of money on big-name DJs to ensure a crowd will come, etc etc.  If it all works 
they'll make a nice little profit for one night of work.  But as someone 
pointed out -- it might have been Brian, it might have been JSL -- there's no 
accounting for things like bad weather and the whims of party goers.  Like any 
other business, if they find a formula that works (i.e. Martin's parties) they 
stick to it to ensure success.

If you don't like this, then don't go to the party.  The SF scene is well
enough established that most times you can make good guesses as to the tangible 
aspects of the party before you decide to put down your money.  If there's no 
other choice than a massive on the night you want to go out, and you don't feel 
like going to the massive, then don't go.  Go to a movie.  Stay home and sleep 
and then go hiking the next day.  If you do decide to go, then remember that 
you are dealing with a business rather than a loose conglomeration of friends 
who happen to have a sound system and records.  There will be rules and 
procedures and prices as if it were any other entertainment service -- you 
don't haggle over the price of a round of mini-golf or ask to see a few minutes 
of a move to see what it is about, right?

By the same token, if you decide to go and you don't like the service, then let 
others know.  In the case of going out clubbing or raving, we really are 
consumers and it's always good to be an informed consumer.  People might not 
agree with you -- I know people who refuse to fly on Continental, for example, 
yet I've NEVER had a problem with that airline -- but at least your experience 
is out there for people to think about.  Make sure your complaint goes to 
people who can do something about it.  Maybe Lyons Security would benefit
from a polite-yet-firm letter written to them.  Maybe the landlord who owns
a certain club would benefit.  The organizers are not the only good targets
for hearing complaints.

I know this is all might seem like a far cry from love and unity etc.  Well,
the hard facts are that big parties are big parties and they can't be run like 
a donation-only event where the DJs are donating their time and the people 
helping with promtion are doing it for free and stuff like that.

Take stock in what you want to support, and then do something about it.  If you 
want to see the massives continue but with changes, then offer to work for the 
organizer.  If they won't have you because their group is pretty much a sealed 
posse, then find someone else to work for.  If nothing else then only go to the 
parties that have given you what you like in the past.

My personal stance on all this is that I don't generally go for big parties, 
and I have a rule that I won't go to any party that charges more than $10 
unless I REALLY REALLY want to.  There are some parties that you just KNOW you 
want to go to no matter what the cost, you know?  When I decide to go to a big 
party it's a special event for me, something that I'm excited about.  Maybe the 
DJ list is amazing.  Maybe every single net person I know will be there.  Those 
are the massives I save my money for, and I'm yet to be truly disappointed.

 After reading John's post , I got the impression that it was a combination
of passionatley felt opinions , and "facts" based on his experience. The 
phrase "just the facts" refers to the numbers and the stuff about estimated
pricing. The stuff about "whimpy ass complaints" is his expression of
impatience , that is , his "opionion", of complaints from folks who ignore
the financial situation of the promoter , or who make complaints in 
of the promoter's financial constraints/responsibilities.

 But John used the qualifiers "whiny" and "whimpy" to refer to the 
complaints , not the complainers. A fine point, but an important one when
we are trying to distinguish between a reaction/rebuttal to statements 
and an actual attack on the complainer(s) , which would be an insult.

Subject: Hot and Heavy: Debating Online
Status: 

I like debating. More than that, I thrive on it. It brings out new
ideas and other people's point of view. It gets people involved.  And
though often there is far more heat than light, there usually _is_
light if one looks for it.

I can debate for hours on something I feel passionately about without
ever once getting upset or calling someone names. I've been known to
debate opposite of my personal feelings just to get into another point
of view.

Lately, there have been times when an argument on SFraves turned into
a fight. People hurt other people. Names were called. People left.
Why?

Well there's lots of reasons. There are a lot of controls during
in-person behavior that aren't there online. If you say something
embarrassing about someone else, others will give you a look of
disapproval. That disapproval, so easily done in person, isn't there
online unless someone overtly states it, which they're not likely to
do. People learn this quickly, and become quick and free with their
personal attacks, even though they sting just as much.

Here's some thoughts I've had about the situation over the years. Some
of them would probably apply well to in-person conversations. I hope
that SFraves, as well as any forum, can be a place to express one's
views, and to discuss and agree or disagree without fear of personal
retaliation. Our diversity and willingness to express it are one of
the things that make us great.

-  Don't use the word "you". It almost always indicates some sort of
   personal attack, rather than a disagreement of point. Someone once
   told me "When someone uses the word You, they have lost the
   argument." Don't question people's qualifications. Don't call them
   complainers or whiners. Don't call them anything. That's not
   debate, that's personal attack.

   What are you trying to prove? Is it worth insulting someone or
   hurting their feelings? Remember that the person at the other
   keyboard is human like you. Concentrate not on the other person,
   but on the point you are trying to debate. Focus on making your
   arguments convincing.

-  Don't quote and respond to a post two sentences at a time. It's very
   inflammatory. It usually ignores the more important overall message
   in favor of contradicting small points out of context.  It's easy,
   which is why it is so commonly used, but it's not effective at
   making one's own point because it's not coherent. I've learned not
   to even read the things because they usually contain no useful
   information.

   Much better is to write your own one or two line summary of the
   other person's post, and then write your own essay on what you
   believe. You'll give a lot more useful information this way. Your
   readers will also give it a lot more weight.

-  Remember that everyone's viewpoint is valid to them. When someone
   says something to us that doesn't make sense, most of us think
   right away: "That's wrong!"

   Stop for a moment. See if you can break that habit.  Instead of
   "That's wrong," ask yourself: "In what way could that possibly be
   true?" Instead of dismissing their viewpoint, search for the
   validity of it. Few things are so black and white that we can all
   agree. That, strangely enough, if one of the strengths of our
   society. Work with that, and acknowledge it.

   Likewise, explain your perspective. If people know the history and
   breadth of the thoughts that went into your viewpoint, it will go
   far into helping them acknowledge it. Don't say things like "I've
   been doing this for 8 years so I should know." Rather, explain what
   you've done and how it's affected your thinking.

-  Don't get mad and leave. Stick it out. Take ten. Hit the 'n' key.
   Hit the 'k' key. Call up a friend and talk about it.  But don't
   leave. Chances are, people want you around. And chances are you
   have something to contribute.

   Discussions get hot and heavy sometimes. That's a fact of life any
   time you throw a bunch of non-apathetic people together, whether it
   be on a computer network or in person. Stick around, and look for
   the useful content.

-  If you find someone's arguments and style particularily convincing,
   take note of their style and form. Emulate those people who move
   you the most. It's one of the best steps towards making your
   writing more effective.

 If you gave reasons for why you thought it fell under the catagory of
"whimpy ass complaints" , I'd at least have some points to rebut or

 Hmmm - as far as the occurance of direct attacks on people and dismissing 
their concerns as frivolous , let's get some quotes from the posting in 
question:

John said:
)I have read the entire littany of rubbish posted on the list most recently.
)I really cannot belive what I am hearing.
)
)First we hear Sean blast away about some items he finds apalling.  And
)rightfully so (in his own mind, which is OK with me).  But you have got so
)many things wrong my man....here...let me put it to you in numbers my man:

( Some $$$ estimates of expenses ) 

)         =========
)         $21,400    Total (@20 each mean 1070 for break even)

)Rough estimate, and I did NOT talk to Martin (and never have) about his
)finances.  

(more lines about expenses) 

)And this is why I HATE whiny ravers!
)
)Blah, blah, nag, nag, me, me, mine, mine....that's all I have heard on the
)list for some time.  Mostly from those who have NEVER had a vested interest
)in doing anything but complaining.  Very, VERY, few have even tried todo a
)party on their own, but have plenty of room to tell a promoter what he/she
)needs to do to get their $10-$20 pryed from their tight assed wallets!
)
)Secondly, a "promoter" goes on a serious financial limb to do something
)that they *LOVE*  . ...

( Many passionate lines about Martin's travails and efforts )

)You'd think he's living pretty high on the hog, but that is not the case.
)He lives modestly, because, for all you misinformed pissed off partygoers,
)he makes a MODEST living.  He has not made what you THINK he's made.  SO
)unless you're his bank, back off!!!

( More defense of promoters and Martin specifically )

)So funny, so friggin funny.  All these wimpy ass complaints...but did you
)forget:
 - No ID's (it was an ALL AGES EVENT PEOPLE !!!)
 - Sealed WATER was allowed (keep ur water bottle and fill it up later).

( List of other positive points about Gathering )

)This is not to say that the party did not have it's bad points.  Security
)previously noted.  But to pan a party because you could not strike a deal
)is bunk.  Deal making is for kingpins, millionaires, or flea markets.
)Unless you consider a rave any of these things, keep your bartering to
)yourself!

)Why $15 b4 xxxtime:  To show appreciation to those people who showed up
)early.  

 ( Other stuff about admission price changing )

)  And BTW about this cut rate, bargaining rubbish, what makes ANYONE
)so special that THEY think they should NOT have to pay what others have
)GLADLY paid?  I just don't get it....If you cannot afford to go out, then
)stay home.  But don't blame the promoter for treating you like he does ALL
)his other patrons; EQUALLY (A word everyone loves to use, but HATES to
)apply)!!!

)Sean et al have some fine points about what disturbed them about the party.
)Although I disagree with the pretense under which they are based, he has
)his own ideas about the way things should be done.  Promoters should
)listen...

)But maybe they will lsiten if you do your own thang, do it consistently,
)and show them the way...only through demonstation can certain points be
)made.  If one is so cocksure then do a production, take the risk
)(consistently), and let them know how things are to be done....

)P.S.  .... M. really
)had very little choice but to do what he did.  Considering his past, and
)what he's given back (more than MOST), he deserves success!!!

-------------------------------------------------------

 So , on my re-reading , it seems that John did make an effort to give
his reasons as to why he's upset with folks on this list who make certain
types of complaints. I think that any criticism of John's posting that 
addresses his "whiny ravers" statement , but ignores his statements 
backing up his opinion , are criticisms of John's manners or choice of
words . None of the critical posts have directly addressed the points
John brought up to explain WHY he "HATES whiny ravers"  

 Also , reading between the lines , you can also get the feeling that he 
is defending Martin from attacks that he feels are based on ignorance.

I also want to ask permission from Phred,  John Lee,  and others that

Beautiful post, Sean.  Words to live by.  

I apologize for having used language that turned my criticisms of
the two posts you made into an attack on you.  In a medium where
the only representation of a person is his thoughts and words, it's
all to easy for that to happen, but that doesn't absolve me of my
wrong doing.  I could have used words that were a lot less biting and
insulting, definitely.

You do have a wonderfully positive energy, Sean, and are definitely a
positive force in the scene, even if at times I feel you set certain

Status: 


Well, I managed to get out a bit this year, and before the memories
are filed away into nostalgic oblivion, I thought I'd share my personal
favorites of '93.  I'd love to hear what others thought the best parties 
for them were, i.e. the ones were you had a great time, whatever the 
reason.
 
I'd also like to say thanks to everyone who has shared their positve 
energy and helped to make the scene special this year.  
 
 
Unity - Jan or Feb? - Richmond Civic Center
 
Most of the SF promoters came together for this one, a benifit for Malachy,
a beloved promoter injured in a car accident.  I usually don't enjoy the
lack of intimacy of such big events (~5,000) but this was a massive with 
heart.   2 great chill out rooms, 2 pumpin' DJ rooms, and a spirit shared 
by the majority.  The venue provided some scenic diversity, but without
the energy scattering that often results from the wandering hordes that
never seem to settle into a groove at these kinds of things. Just  about
everyone I knew was there.  And although the 2nd Unity was also good, 
it did not match the unique specialness of this one.

Channeling - Spring - The Stone
 
People have always bad-mouthed The Stone, but I usually managed to have a 
great time there as long as the goal was to dance and sweat for 5 hours 
straight.  I went to this party alone, ran into a couple of friends, and 
basically went nuts for the entire night.  It was my introduction to Tony, 
who blew me away.  The vibe was extremely friendly, and peaked when 
everyone on the dance floor spontaneously formed a circle to dance the 
Hora.
 
Ananda - Summer - Candlestick Park
 
This was a small, free outdoor event, with lesser known DJ's like Shoban
and Goa Gil.  Being able to bliss out to some hard trance with a small
bunch of totally tripped out people while watching the sun rise over the
Bay was, well... If Goa Gil had been able to beat match, my mind wouldn't
be here today to think about it.
 
Fluid Groove - Sept - Marina area
 
This small Bryce/Ethan renegade against the backdrop of the Golden Gate
Bridge was a very spiritual affair.  Although we got a taste of some
hardcore from Laura, I mostly remember this as a beautifully serene
gathering of family around a small fire watching the hazy dawn with
seagulls leaving trails across the rolling fog and passing boats by the
wave-lapped shore.
 
Connection Earth - Oct 3 - Golden Gate Park
 
I could be accused of bias with this one, since it was an SFR event that
I helped organize.  But I just love Marx Meadows and the tribal sense
that comes from dancing with nature.  This was another blissful family
affair where everything just seemed to come together.  It now has the
extra significance of probably being the last house music party ever to 
be held at this site. :-(
 
Basics - Sept or Oct? - Trocadero
 
I'm not sure what happened with this one.  I arrived late to avoid the
vibe-killing ejection of the 18-20 yr. olds.  The sound system was
horrible, and all the lighting effects had died.  But my expectations had
been set extremely low.  Ultimately, I think the  DJing, presence of 
friends and the overall spirit of the reamining attendees helped create an 
unexpectedly wonderful time.  It was the most fun I had at a Basics since
the one at the Stone 2 years ago.
 
Full Moon Rave - Oct. 30 - Bonny Dune Beach
 
A Magical setting among cliffs by the beach.  Over 2,000 beautiful people.
Killer music from the Wicked posse.  Plus it was our 10 year wedding 
anniversary.  Sigh.
 
ComeUnity - Nov - 1015 Folsom
 
The reemergence of this legendery party with Malachy at the helm again
was a reaffirmation of what made (and makes) the SF scene so amazing.
The last 2.5 hours of this party was like a religious experience.
 
Honorable Mentions: The Orb show,  Wicked at The Stone, a couple of
Bulletproof Boat & Boogie Buffet parties, Spring GG Park party.

Was that really the hora? :-)

This was the same night as "A Child Is Born" which was a complete
fiasco replete with the cops teargassing the crowd (down at the One
Step Beyond, Santa Clara).  I'm really glad that the people I was with
were determined to go out and have a good time :-) because this
particular Channeling was really great.

Stunning.  Absolutely wonderful.  This weekend almost killed me :-)

Subject: Least Favorite Parties of 93
Status: 

In the spirit of the most favorite parties, i think it's also
important to remember the least favorite parties and why, so
that they are (hopefully) not repeated next year.

Also, I want to make it clear I don't mean this post as a downer.
It's just that most end-of-year lists include a Best of/Worst of.
Here's my worst of, and why.

I promise to post a best of, too.

Oh, and the dates are approximate--i don't recall exactly when
these happened...some things are better forgotten!


March -- Wicked, 174 King St.
King St. *filled* by fog machine.  Coughed up black phlegm
for 2 days.  Got a cold that lasted for 2 weeks, and kept me
flat on my back.

June -- Channelling, San Mateo Armory
Gangstas roaming outside.  Extreme, military security.  Told
ins & outs allowed, on trying to get some air, refused in & out.  Thorough,
near cavity search.  Music too soft.  Next door to residences.

June -- FMR, Las Pulgas Water Temple
Started at 4AM. One DJ.  Broken up by state police, in riot gear.
A high point, though, was when some brave raver danced in front of
a police spotlight, casting a huge shadow on the trees behind us.
Significant grass damage, however.  Way too many people for the
location (only because the cars were so visible). Left hand-stamped
images on many windows.

July -- FMR, Richmond waterfront park
Started at 4AM. 2 DJs.  Local police blocked off only exit.  Many
nitrous tanks in parking lot. Many fireworks.  People hurt by fireworks.
People setting off fireworks in midst of dancers.  People aiming
fireworks into crowd.  Much grass damage.  

September -- Aurgasm
The night the security people at 174 King pulled the plug on Mark
Farina and told us all to go home because the bar "didn't make 
enough money".

Oct. -- Corduroy City
Went to location on voice mail--empty warehouses, no sound, no cars.

Nov. -- Energizer
The party that never went off. Greedy promoters who took the money
and ran. The night i lost an $850 generator.  Rental truck fu. 
Promoter fu. Cars following us on the freeway fu.  Bodies swarming
on truck fu.  Boy/Girl fu. Boy/boy fu. Don't let this happen to you! 

Nov. -- Basics, Trocadero
Very BAD sound.  Age cleansing at 2:00AM.  

December -- Energy, Trocadero
The party that had many name DJs on the flyers, as well as Dee Lite, and
none had been booked.

As promised, here's my list of best parties of 93, and why.

Summertime -- Vortex, OSB, Santa Clara
Strong net.presence.  Awesome set by Ernie Munson. OSB 
redeemed.  Great live ambient.

Summertime -- YSH at 24th St., & elsewhere
Net.pre-parties. Big crowds.  Great music.  the great outdoors.

Labor Day Weekend -- Fluid Groove
Crissy field location--view of golden gate bridge.  Friendly 
GGNRA police. Friendly MPs. First gig for Sound Vision. Friends
from all over the country. Seals checking us out.  People dancing
on rocks looking out at the bay.  Wonderful flyers, wonderful
people, wonderful music.  Largely a net.party.

October -- Connection Earth
Sunday in the Parkk with House. A brief moment where we seemed
to have burned off the clouds.  Smiling faces.  Booming sound.
Great DJs. Cooperative authorities.  Helpful people.

Halloween -- Terence McKenna @ Great American Music Hall
Live house/ambient. Hyperdelic video.  Strong net.presence. Terence,
of course.

December -- Open House
Friends and family at a house party.

i have always wondered at the progression of music between the

have established themselves really well on the east coast (although when
they first played at a club in baltimore they got mixed reviews) and then
garth has gone out for essence 4....etc. etc. 

we all know of the practice of a dj living in a city for a long time but
still being refered to as being from somewhere "exotic"

but i really don't understand why some of the big names on the east coast
haven't made there way to sf...i mean ok there are dante and a few
others...but what about adam x, heather heart, frankie bones!! *these dj's
have even played europe*, scott henry, wink, onionz, james christian, i
could go on and on...

why is there no exchange going on? i mean a nice touch at some big

helps draw people!...
so i am just wondering...and would love to hear some comments and ideas as
to why this persists..????

I think it's because of the music that some of these DJs spin, maybe promoters
don't think they would go over well out here.  Someone sent me a James 
Christian tape and I don't think his fast breakbeat would easily blend in here.
People like Adam X and Beltram have been featured in LA so maybe promoters or
other people feel San Francisco is too locked into it's own groove?

Perhaps it's just the perceptions and misperceptions of the music. James 
Christian doesn't spin breakbeat.  I've heard him do hardcore and hard trance,
but his real forte seems to be a the harder ends of the house spectrum.

Also, many many of the big East Coast DJs spin a variety of styles.  Adam X 
does hardcore, acid, and very mellow slow tweaky stuff.  Last time I heard J
immy Crash he played old style house and electro from 1985-1989.  He also 
spins deep dark trance.  Josh Wink (who Brian tells me was out once and didn't 
go over very well) used to spin trance, and now plays a very good tribal set.  
Frankie Bones, best known for screaming "hardcore, you know the score" and 
"make some fucking noise" has put down some sets that were very influenced by 
Latin rhythms -- sort of techno salsa, if you will.  Heather Heart is so 
versatile I have heard her put down old Chicago style acid, multi-layered 
trance, and grinding hardcore ALL IN THE SAME SET and have it work out 
wonderfully.

My other question is where are the European DJs?  We've had Frank De Wulf, 
Saskia Slegers (a.k.a. Miss DJAX), Laurent Garnier, d'Julz, Tin Tin (who 
migrates back and forth between the UK and Boston), Sven Vath, Paul Van Dyk, 
and Mundo Muzique.  They bring us new tunes, new styles, and new experiences.  
It's not so much about whether they "blend in" or not, but more about giving 
people something that is a little bit special.

Now, aside from just complaining, I'm going to do something about this.  I will 
find a way to get Heather Heather (a.k.a. DJ Heart) out here and onto some 
events.  Even if it means me using my hoarde of frequent flyer miles to pay for 
her trip out (and thus giving up the trip to Japan I've been saving for).  I'm 
sure if I get tapes showing Heather's different styles and really talked to 
enough promoters I'd be able to find her a few gigs.  I can't imagine people 
not loving her --  aside from being very talented, she is good vibe personified 
(much like Liz Roberts from YSH).  It will take me a while to acomplish this -- 
I'm aiming for this summer.

The music got much better after the first DJ(Loren I think).
I wasn't in the mood to dance lastnight so I just enjoyed the

I find it hard to judge "bad" parties, because if I'm having a really
lousy time, I usually leave, or chill until it gets better.  So for me,
a "least favorite party" would have to be one where a significant
amount of torture was endured, otherwise it just gets forgotten along
with all the ones that got busted, or fizzled, or failed to get me
excited for some reason.

Here are 3 that have left a stench that stands out from the overflowing
sewer of mediocre memories:

DNA - Afterlife - New Year's Day

After spending New Year's Eve *not* getting into the Gathering and 
driving around in the pouring rain, me & my buddies were jonesing
for a party.  We arrived at the DNA at 6:00am where a few sleazy
clubbers from the DNA's NYE club thing were still hanging out.  The 
first 2 DJ's that came on played sets that were simply awful.  I guess
they were hung over or something.  And although Simon finally showed 
to liven things up, I'll remember that party as one were I hung out 
for 4hrs (the DNA is not a fun place to chill) waiting desperately 
for something good to happen.

Wicked - winter? - Sound Factory

My only visit to the Sound Factory was a bummer.  I just wasn't into
the club vibe, even with some of my favorite DJs there.  Despite great
music and sound system, I found the heat unbearable, and the scene
there just left me without the inspiration to overcome it.

Yeah, I was there.  After the previous Channeling at The Stone, I had
high expectations.  I'll never understand why the middle of suburbia was 
chosen as a site for this party.  I  hung out for 3 hours of gloom - fog 
machines with no lights or ventilation added to the overall mood of despair.

This party really came together when it was moved to the Berkeley Marina.
Those out-of-phase speakers were really fun - dancing where the 
frequencies cancelled each other provided some trippy sonic entertainment.

Uh Bryce, I don't think it's fair to call this a party, not even a
bad one, unless you actually hung out or tried to dance there anyway.`

I was cranky about this one because i left a particularly good Mission 
Rock, where Markie was spinning, to go to this thing, whose location had
been announced for almost a week on the vmail, only to find several cars 
circling the block.  eventually, we all stopped, and circled our cars,
and danced to someone's car stereo.  i wanted to mention this one
becuse they left the location on the voice mail until the next day.
sigh.  this has happened a couple of times with corduroy city, though
they have pulled off some amazing parties from time to time.

but you're right...it wasn't *really* a party.

oh, and about the FMR in Richmond...i was too wasted to go to the Marina,
and so i certainly couldn't put it into my "parties i know about". but,
the richmond portion of the party was quite bad for me, and made me
very cranky, and is the last Wicked FMR i've been too. they'll really
have to pull of a string of amazing parties to get me to go back. i was
especially disappointed with that one because it was the 2nd in a row 
i had been too that was uninspiring and ended with serious police 
intervention, and had unpleasantness going on in the crowd.  all in all,
wicked FMRs have been bad times for me, and i won't go anymore...even
though lots of my friends go. my experiences at FMRs were a strong
motivator for throwing and attending smaller renegades.

Yes, it's possible, although I will admit you have to look a little harder 
for it! My favorite small party down there is Sketch Pad (213-368-4748), which
is on Sunday afternoons from around 1-10pm...if you will still be around, I
am going to spin there on either the 16th or the 23rd. DJs are usually Taylor
and Sandra Collins plus others (if you know of any of the DJs down there).
Doc Martin is supposedly starting up something cool very soon...i don't know
the details offhand but his parties are usually pretty underground and he
atttracts a good and friendly crowd...joe rice (ambient@netcom.com) has the
details on that if you want to write to him, if he hasn't already replied to
your post...I hope that's a good start for you...:)

> I went to one massive when I was down there 2 summers ago, and it was AWFUL.

Well, avoid the massives! I generally do, and that's both for LA and SF unless
it's something that looks REALLY good...:)

Oh, and I don't want to get into another LA vs SF flamewar...but it's not all
bad down there, OK? Trust me, I have had some fantastic times down there!!!!

I don't know how old the tape is, but I *do* know what breakbeat is when I

WICKED is concerned about the way that the FMRs are going as well,
there is serious talk of suspending them for the winter (or sending them
seriously underground) and regrouping in the spring.
Alan and Markie feel that the ritual nature of the FMR is being lost
and it's turning into one huge dance party with a lot of nitrous, etc.
I'm not certain if there will be a FMR this month or not.

puttin together techno sets.  I did hear a techno tape he made about 2
months ago, and i admit that for this codger afeared of high BPMs the set
sounded kickin.

I too feel that the FMR's have turned into one big oversized high school/
frat party (ie lots of alcohol and nitrous). The vibe just hasn't been
there for me. I did miss the last one that happened at Boony Doon that
I heard went of well. I was too tired. But one of my biggest gripes is
that they end up starting so late, or the cops come and it doesn't go off
at all and it's one long night of driving place to place. And in the case
of the Richmond party the vibe just wasn't there. The music was way too
retro disco for my tastes that night. I thought the location was great 
though. The party up at Pt Reyes was a disappointment not only cuz it
got busted but because the cops wouldn't even let us hang out and enjoy
the beach. :( So I feel that it has to be a pretty sure thing (or if I'm
in the mood for adventure) before I will go. Or if it's on a weekend. I
work on the weekdays so it's just not worth it to me anymore.

Anyways, some of the best parties to me were:
Unity at the Richmond Civic Auditorium
I didn't make it to the Come/Unity party, but I thought this one was alot
of fun.
One of my favorites this year had to be Vision at the Sonoma County 
Fairgrounds. (All my friends were there!)
The Fluid Groove party at Crissy Field (what more can I say that hasn't
been said already?)
Halloween - Terrence McKenna thing at the Great American Music Hall

Wicked at the Sound Factory: alot of people panned this one but I had
a great time. Sometimes I like it HOT cuz I'm always cold.

Happy holidays,

Well for me...

	The return of Come/Unity
		The first party was great because Mal was there and
		it was good to see that he hasn't given up on us.
		The second party was even better, I saw lots of
		people from "the old days" who just don't go out
		any more.

	Halloween FMR
		2000+ people on the beach but the music was right on time.

	24 Hours of House Music @ KZSU
		Well this was a SMALL party with mostly the DJ's but
		a couple of sfravers were there (you know who you are)
		very intimate and continuous.

	The Finale of Groove Kitchen at the Stone
		Still remember John Williams doing double sets and the
		thick vibe at 4:30 a.m.

	Pulgas water temple FMR
		It was broken up but the moment when the raver danced
		infront of the police spot light is the stuff movies
		are made of.

	Connection Earth
		This was the turning point in a summer of not so great
		parties.  Good music and good vibes. I'm still waiting
		for the tape Brian :(

	YSH
		These parties have been pretty consistantly great
		my hat goes off to the sisters for not just complaining
		about the state of the Scene but actually doing something
		about it in a BIG way that has made a VERY BIG difference.

I doubt I'm saying anything original, but it's with the hope that

I'd like to cast my votes for:

Halloween FMR (and thanks again to Brian for his help)
(Summer FMR at Point Reyes) - it was a silly location and I think it was
  obvious we'd get busted, but the backup to Berkeley Marina was a big hit
  as well.  The losers with the fireworks sucked, but the incredible
  beachside moon made up for any hassles.  Thanks, susie!
Liquid Air, late fall, usual place in SF off 3rd.  I would love to see more
  events at this incredible location.
Basics Reunion.  I don't care for indoor events, but this wasn't bad.
  I would have liked some more room to move around in... one of the big
  things I like is the unlimited walking of outdoor events.  Thanks, mau!

and drat, I forgot the name of the other great one... oh well.  Santa Cruz
  Mountains, grassy field w/chill area in the woods, early fall, off 17.
  Just a nice night with a nice sound, some cool friends, a large blanket,
  and falling asleep on a friend.  The cops eventually came, but by then it
  was too late to stop us from experiencing.

to Universal Groove...  See Ya all there..

My best raves....

WOW!!  There were SOOOO many good ones,  it's hard to tell.    But here
they are..

4th of July GATHERING was tops on my list... Remember the hill fire... This
was the one where I dropped acid for the first time...  I had such a wonderful
time,  and the people were so great...  I was awake the entire weekend,  dancing
non-stop.   The FMR was the day before out near Richmond park,  which also was
really great.    After the Gathering,  went to the 4th of July bash at the
Concourse (or was it the fashion center).

Penalepes Web - was my NEXT favorite and best rave of the year,  way out in
the wilderness near Willits.   The weather was so GREAT,  very HOT in the daytime
well over 105 degrees in the shade,  but that swim in the Eel river really
topped the day.   It was a long,  hot and dusty drive,   but it was worth it.

LoveStock,  out near Modesto...  Was not that well attended,   but for me,
it really was great.   Outdoors,  and the DJ's were really hot.

Home at the Mission theator was the BEST indoor rave of the year,  thanx
to Ethan and friends for putting on this amazing event.    Although I would
have liked it to last longer than till 5:30,  it was still the BEST indoor
rave of the year.    They had adequate ventilation,  fans on or near the
dance area,  and free food.

Tribal Funk in Walnut Creek armory was really high on my list.   It has a 
very large area,  and an outdoors chill area,   and the music was really
great.  It was also put on by a new promoter and not the usual mainstream
group.   They did everything right on this one,  had a good DJ lineup,
plus a few NEW DJs like DJ Utopia which were really great.

Funkey Techno Tribe,  because of its location "Galleria",  although was
very pricey to get in,  was also really good.

Basics at the armory in SF,   Vision at Sonoma fairgrounds,  and the raves
at the Richmond Civic center,  Funkey Techno Tribe,  Wicked, GK in that
order was how I rated SOME of the raves I attended.    I attended a LOT more
than I mentioned.

Worst raves,  worse and best venues...

Wicked at the Sound Factory was just too HOT...   GK at 174 King St,  really
cause me major health problems and for that I will NEVER attend any function
at 174 King st again.... So take heed you rave promoters,  and venue operators,
that unless the faschist security people at that venue change their ways and
provide better chill out and cooler places to go to,  don't ever expect me
(or any of my friends to attend).    16th and Harrison although SOMETIMES
allow us to go into the outside areas,   I think this venue is "so so".

The Troc is way too hot,  although they have powerful air conditioning system,
they NEVER turn it on,  because they purposly want it hot so they can sell
more drinks.

Best indoor niteclub venue has to be 1015 Folsom St.    It is large,  has high
cealings,  adequate ventilation in the "sun room",   they allow ins and outs
and I give it a Thumbs up.

The best large venue has to be the Sonoma Fairgrounds where Vision was held.
It was very large,   had good ventilation,  fairly cool,  and very large space.

Have a happy Holidays..

Check out the interview with Buck in the new issue of URB. Also, I do believe
you can see a couple of sfravers in the background of Garth's picture in the
San FranDisco club section.

ALSO--please do not flame me heavily if this list should get some mail for
people to subscribe to the list. The list address (along with many others) was
printed in the magazine, but the "-request" suffix was omitted from the 
instructions to subscribe to the lists. This was not done by me, it was done
when I was away for Thanksgiving and it was in to the printer by the time I
got back. I want to apologize in advance if we do get such letters, I know 
that can be an annoyance. :)

ONE MORE THING--check out a few more sfravers in the "online community" section
of the WORD TO URB column.

(and maybe you can read my record reviews if you want (-:  )

Status: 

Some friends and I checked out SpaceLab last night, since YSH wasn't 
happening.  It's set upstairs at the Troc, and was $3 before midnight,
$5 after (i got there b4 12 :) ).  It was a pretty happening event,
with Alex from Gaia Mantra, Shobhan, and Jason from SpaceTime spinning
(and a little bit of live music,too!).  They really set up the space
very well.  It was quite comfy, and quite a number of friends who i
hadn't seen in quite a while, as well as some current faves were
there.

Although the bar was running, i never got the feeling that alcohol was
being *pushed* on us, and i hung out at the bar just to have a place
to rest against.  Usually, bartenders get fairly agressive, but i didn't
get that vibe at all...a very pleasant change.  It was also 18+, which
was also quite nice.  There were lots of smiles and family around.

I also enjoyed the music, which was harder and faster and more acidic
than much of the music i hear out.  It was an interesting and refreshing
alternative.  Also, the sound system was nice, but not overpowering,
so the chill area was comfortable for talking.  The chill area also had
plenty of couches, chairs, and cushions to lounge on...quite nice.

I'd recommend this as a place to check out if you're feeling in the mood
for a smaller, more underground hangout on a thursday (though, of course,
i still very much love YSH's when they go off).  Also, i felt pleased
to be supporting the tribe of light crew, who include jason and alex, who
have both been very nice to me.

It seems as if the music has changed more towards the house/hiphop
style.  a couple of days ago, I found some of my old tapes from the
depths of the glove compartment.  Lo and behold, some really cool 
stuff I used to listen to ages ago;  They really sounded good to me.
I didn't realize the music had changed so much until I listened to 
these tunes.

Basically, I say "crank up the BPM!!!"

Though I appreciate and dance to house music (except that with wailing 
Divas), I really prefer the harder, faster, and trancier songs.  I've 
gone to the two previous SpaceLabs and have really enjoyed the music and the 
vibe (Jonah's live perfomance trading off with Alex's spinning was a 
particular treat!). 

While other weeklies have DJs that spin this hard-whatever-you-want-to-call-it,
IMHO I think it is nice to be able to go to a particular event for a specific 
sound.  This is why SpaceLab has attracted me to it so far.  I just wish it 
wasn't the same night as YSH; I like to stay at one event per night if I'm 
digging it!

I have heard a number of other SF Ravers talk about bringing more of this 
sound to SF events.  And, some of them already have done so!  (BTW, 
haven't we already seen a thread on this topic?)  

I would love to hear more hard trance, hard core, and even breakbeat--
especially at the massives (sorry Garth, et al. I am *not* a fan of yours). 
But I would also like the DJ playing this to occasionally pull back and mix in 
some slower tracks, so I can catch my breath. :)

[ Raves ] Message 207 (6 left): Thu Dec 23, 1993  12:44am
From: horus (moksha@am.UCSC.EDU)
Subject: rave revival energy dynamics

the rave scenario is designed to facillitate the movement of humans from 
the narrow scope of waking consciousness into a perceptual realm of 
empirical knowledge. This knowledge transcends linguistic limitations as 
it is channelled directly into the human nervous system. When you can hit 
it you feel like all the information of the universe is inside your own head
throbbing and pulsating without form or meaning but there nevertheless 
and very much a part of you. The formula of the rave is so constructed as 
to ease the transformation as the rythmn builds and blends fusing individual 
mind into a larger apparatus . This apparatus strips the mind of its ego 
merging opposites into the unity of creation; providing a momentary glimpse 
of the eternal currents moving flowing within the continuum. We rise up and 
thrive under burning stars and fall again to ashes with the coming of the 
night. These changes are merely temporal shifts as energy moves from one 
form to another ,occupying form with loving playfullness only to tire of 
its novelty with entropic boredom. But as the phoenix, up from the ashes of 
probability will rise new toys for the  child of the universal mind to 
play with. As life forms we are merely whimsy in the fantasy of the creatrix. 
				In a universe of infinite probability it's 
only a matter of time before even the most impossible events come to occur. But
within this quantum maelstrom life does not exist. This storm of energy is 
merely compost, a substrate for the spawn of matter in the petri dish of the
cosmos, and we are microbes filled with anarchic longing for multiplicity. But
in the blink of Shiva's eye we are probing the deepest and most vast mysteries
of life edging our species to the brink of self destruction along the way.
How astonishing and magickal it is that from the pools of subatomic chaos
has evolved an organism capable of keenly perceiving and studying itself 
and the medium in which it exists! Did primordial protozoa know that someday
they'd be packed into a warehouse full of low frequency sound sources throbbing at 120 beats per minute, their recently evovled sensory processing mechanisms
overloaded by high energy photon strobes and sound architectures, struggling to
hold onto life and love. So now we dance but dance with fire and let the star 
within you burn bright. We are children of chance but we have the power to 
steer our planet back to eden. This Ibeleive is what the rave tries to
emphasise, that we can reunite with the gods and goddesses who walk through 
wet grass along the edge of the euphrates uplifted by the strong blood of 
the land. This is where eternity stretches out under the shade of a drooping
palm leaf, sipping fresh water from a desert oasis.

OK, I'm with you so far.

Is the use of the term "self destruction" meant to imply that there's
something wrong with the fact that we are nothing more than transient
energy forms?  After all, new stuff will rise from the ashes anyway.  

> We are children of chance but we have the power to

What "eden" are you referring to?  Do we even hae an agreed upon
definition of what eden would be like? 

> This Ibeleive is what the rave tries to
> emphasise, that we can reunite with the gods and goddesses [...]

Why would we want to?  Why not discover new forms of the spirit embodied 
by these "gods and goddesses"?  Why concern ourselves with godlike entities 
at all?  Aren't the conceptualizations of "god & goddesses" just temporary 
thought/energy patterns that come and go like "toys for the  child of the 
universal mind to play with."?

Bulletproof boat party in Sept.

Connection Earth.

The YSH events by the bay.  YSH kind of kept me interested in the scene

Mission Rock, of course.

Oracle, at 1015 back in April.

Richie Rich party over Thanksgiving.

Un-favorite:  Channeling, June 4th.

Most disappointing:  Unity at Richmond Ctr, July 24th.  Promoters did
everything right.  *I* was bored, and realized that extreme selectivity
is key if I'm going to enjoy this rave stuff.  I'm only going to massives
if my friends drag me , as opposed to the other way around.


Best event I went to, period.:  Burning Man

Susan says that Jan 6th is definitely on and that Tamara is definitely
booked, so start getting excited about it :). More good news is that
space options are looking better and slightly more numerous. Kudos to
Laura and other sisters for working really hard to find alternative
spaces. Also, the hoopla with the Upper Room should be just about

I just went skiing for the first time Saturday and I *loved* it. Since
it's a longish drive from SF to the ski places, if someone would like
to do something like:

    - Drive (or train) to my place in north Sacramento in the evening.
    - Crash at my place.
    - Get up early and drive to the mountains (1 1/2 hrs to Truckee on
      dry roads).
    - Ski all day, drive back to my place in the evening, and crash.
    - Leave for SF the next day when you're not so tired.

I think it'd be a blast. Likewise, if anyone wants to split a lodge
room, that'd be fun too. My number is 916-488-8184. Drop me a line or

P.S.  Look guys, if we're going to start the fast versus slow wars again
let's just stop it right now.  It's unwinnable.  No style of dance music
is inherently blessed by some magus as being the ultimate correct form for
your raving pleasure.  People like what they like and that's the way it
goes.  The most we can do is offer ALTERNATIVES.  The slow happy funky
housey side is already more than adequately represented in the SF scene.  
Why not allow other forms their place too?  It's not like people who like 
techno are going to grab you and drag you to parties and force you to dance.
It's not like Jeno will suddenly decide to throw away all his records and
buy all Rotterdam stuff.  

If you don't like the music, don't go out if you see DJs on the bill that
play music you don't like.  If you do like the music, then go out and
support the promoters and DJs who put on what you like.  But for god's
sake let people have a choice.  For anyone who cares to choose techno
come to YSH on January 13.  For anyone who hates it either stay away that
night or go chill during my set.  It will only last about an hour.

I've learned that one BIG vibe killer isn't so much a certain type of
music, but rather people who don't like a type sitting around and bitching
while others are enjoying it.  I really can't stand breakbeat, and I used
to pout and bitch and look bored during breakbeat sets until it dawned
on me that other people DO love it and I'm being rude and downright mean
to them to try and get in the way of their fun for the meager hour or two
that a breakbeat DJ is on.  So, when I hear breakbeat now, I just go off and
talk to friends, or take a nap, or whatever, but I don't stand around and
complain.

Well, as the point of origin for the current thread concerning hard/fast/

my intent was to make a positive statement that concerned only
my own taste at the time, and to let other people know that SpaceLab 
definitely provided me with an alternative to music more commonly heard
in SF.  

my suggestion and recommendation to anyone interested in harder/faster/acidic
music is to visit SpaceLab, which happens every thursday upstairs at the
Troc.  $3 b4 12.  It's also on your calendars.

For those preferring slower/softer/basic music, i would ask others to make
their recommendations to the list.

Yea!!  I second that....  Perhaps we can set up hard trance area for
those that like it,  as well as the current house sounds we currently have.

Actually,   faster stuff opens up a lot more dance possibilities than
the slower stuff.   At least it does for me....

Status: 

Hi all,
I found this in the January '94 issue of 'Details' magazine, page 18.
[After a fictional timeline of 1994 is presented, we reach the date of 
October 1st.  Picture of a stealth bomber, covered not in fashionable 
black, but in a cascade of colors, swirls and stripes.]

"October 1:
The latest advance in the reconversion of the military-industrial 
complex is the nation's fleet of stealth bombers.  The Revolutionary 
Council, calling the planes counterproductive to world peace, announced 
today that the aircraft will be converted into 'party bombers' and will 
be used to stealthily furnish the international rave network with 
abundant supplies of Ecstasy.  'You're either on the bomber or off the 
bomber,' said a spokesman."

Now if they could shuttle DJs back and forth quickly, we'd be in business.

Virtually yours,

I've always felt a little alien, as opposed to LIKE a little alien, when the
fast vs. slow wars are on because I like individual songs on their own merrits.
Whacky concept I know, but does anyone else out there like songs based on a 
whole bunch of factors, some maybe even subconcious, rather than the speed of
a song?  The first techno I ever fell in love with was on KALX on July 4th 3
years ago and it was so fast and twitchy that I felt like I had ingested
caffeine and I loved it, never even found out what it was and wouldn't even
remember if I heard it today.  Sittin in my favorite chair in my living room,
bongin' out as I do at some point in every day, I prefer slower stuff, maybe
even total ambient if it's later at night such as Eno or Stearns, otherwise
Twitch or Exist Dance stuff or something.

It was the Wicked rave...   Too bad you couldn't go in and enjoy yourself.

Weekend Rave report
===================

Thursday - YSH cancelled again... YUKK!!   But Thunder bay was really hoppin.
Met Carlos there,  but he wasn't spinning.    For some reason,  the DJ's seemed
to not be able to poump up the really long sets I like to dance to,  so the
tunes were somewhat "broken up" into shorter sets.

Also,  the Thunder Bay management is now getting more faschist,  and not allowing
ins-and-outs anymore,  which is a bummer if one needs to get fresh air and chill
out.    So if you've been there before,   and are planning to go back again,
just remember that they no longer permit you to leave and come back.

Guess I'll have to try and attend "Deep space" the next time YSH gets cancelled.


Friday - Nothing was happening,  Christmas Eve,  so stayed home and relaxed
for the first time in over 6 months where I didn't go out.


Saturday - 25th Dec... WICKED was a' happenin...  and WOW!!  What intense
gnarley energy it was.    Before showing up at 1015 Folsom,  I went over to
16th and Harrison to hear Carlos spin at "Colors".    The Sound system at
16th and Harrison was pretty good that night,  as they had it cranked up
and the place was rockin.    Carlos and myself split and we trekked over
to Wicked.   By that time,  things were just getting underway,  and there
were a lot of people by then.   As  usual,  WICKED lived up to their name,
and the DJ's played some really great new stuff.  The "dark room" was the chill 
area,   and the sunlit room was the main dance area.   I was really trancing 
out on the dance floor as much as I can.

The music was totally magical... and my head was really out there,  enjoying
the visuals,  and the sound.   Spend most of my time dancing,  instead of
schmoosing,  to make up for the fact that I couldn't dance last weekend,
and WOW!!  It was great.


Sunday - 26th Dec.   Stayed for Boogie Buffet...  As usual,  the place was
very welcoming,  and was great to be back again to enjoy the relaxing spaces
it provides, and the $2 breakfast.   The Dark room was really hoppin,  and
I spent more time in there,  dancing my butt off until it closed down around
1 pm.   Then we all migrated back into the large room,  and continued to dance
as the breakfast jazz was starting to pick up on the BPMs.   They stayed open
until about 4 pm.

Later on,  boogied over to the End up,  and continued to dance until about 6 pm 
or so,  than I had to leave cause I had to meet someone later.   Earlier that 
afternoon it rained slightly,   but it stopped by the time I got over to the End Up.
Some of the Boogie Buffet crowd wound up at the Ene Up as well.

Next week will be the LAST Boogie Buffet,  so if you haven't been over there yet,
Do try and make it New Years day if you have the energy.   If not,  it's a great
place to take a short 2 hour nap after partying hard over New Years.   GACK!!
Don't know what I'll be doing after Boogie closes down.     I hear they will be
starting up in the spring again.

Stay tuned for the New Yours report next week...

Cheers

Martini is "glam night" at 1015 Folsom.  Lots of alcohol presence, not
a ravey scene.  Dies down after 2am, as you might expect.

I was there once, though (when Corduroy City was in the basement), and
Rick Preston was playing his "acid" set, and that was really cool.

Status: 

A quick one because I only ended up at one event -- but what an event!

We showed up at Boogie Buffet around 11:30.  A friend of mine came along
because she'd heard about BB but had never been to one, and is pretty new
to all this.  "I really want to go dancing . . . do you think I should
wear this red strapless dress?"  The answer to both, of course, was, "Yes!"
Well, needless to say she Got It bigtime, we were out skimming the floor
for most of the four-plus hours there.  We arrived just in time for the
shift change in the dark room.  When Jeno popped up in the DJ booth I was
relatively pleased because no matter what his recent sets have been like
(a bit on the down side, I'd say), we would be in good hands and my friend
would get a dollop of good stuff.  Well, let me say I got my ears pinned
back (once again!) by Jeno the Master.  About three tracks in he pulled
out 'Oh So Good,' as if to say, 'OK, here's your top-40 track, now we're
gonna get *serious*' and then it was just that smooth-on-the-rise Jeno
sound we know so well for the next couple of hours in the *best* place
for that, the funky wooden sound box, the Boogie Room.  Later on sound
problems started developing, and I figured that was a good time to head
across, because things were really jelling in the Buffet Room, where
Ernie Munson was rocking the massive with an onslaught of classic *good*
disco (MFSB, BT Express, Dazz), Stevie Wonder and *even* Trouble Funk!
It was a jamdown motor scooter affair lemme tellya!  A great time . . .
Just wish there'd been pancakes, but when I got a Sierra Nevada Porter
from the bar for my beer aficionado friend she thought there really
couldn't be a better place than Boogie Buffet and at that moment in
time I really believed that!

So major props to the BB crew, the BB crowd, Jeno and Ernie (who I last
saw spinning for about 20 of us at 5 in the morning at King St -- so I
was really glad to see him thriving with a crowd!).  I know everyone will
show up for the finale this week, and that will be fine, but this was a
truly great one.

Ernie played Curtis Mayfield's classic 'Truckin' (For Your Love)' and it
really brought home to me how crucial Curtis' contribution has been to
development of the Philly sound and then the good side of disco and melodic
house.  So when we honor the contribution of James Brown, it's also
important to give proper props to those like Curtis Mayfield who've also
enriched our lives with contributions of their own musical genius.

complained about his attitude problem.

YSH is definately cancelled again,  at least that is according to a
phone call I recived from one of the sisters.    Susan called me
this evening and filled me in.

So,  is FMR happening tonight...   I'm on here after 1 am and still
no Email or phone call.

See ya at Basics on NYE, but will probably stop by SuperNova Big Bang
first.    I'm not confirmed for the Wicked/Spundae guest list,  so
don't know if I can make that one.

Happy New Year..

There's a "Keep on Truckin" song or somesuch by Eddie Kendricks, ca.
1973. I do not know of a Curtis Mayfield song on the subject of
truckin' :-) ... And yes, massive massive props are due Curtis Mayfield
nonetheless -- one of the first true believers in positivity (and I
don't even hold his Christianity and occasional preachyness against
him).

re; The Full Moon last night, has anyone any news on 
whether it happened ? Not that it makes much difference now...

I don't feel very good about it, I really look forward to 
these damn FM's a lot and when they don't happen, or when 
I *know* they're on somehwere that I'm not, well, it's not 
a good feeling.

I was down at Bonny Doon last night, along with a crowd of about
80 to 100 others. There was a constant flow of cars thru the 
place, so over the whole night about 1000 people probably passed 
thru there.

The night started out so promisingly. I called a promoter friend
of mine in the east/north bay, and he wasn't going but he phoned
Garth for me. Garth was ill, and therefore wasn't going either, 
but the information he had was that it was probably Bonny Doon.
This was at 10:00pm last night.

I checked back with my friend at midnight, and no new 
information had been received, so off went I with my girlfriend
to the beach.  I drive from San Mateo, so it wasn't a big deal 
for me. Hoever, a friend of a friend called me from Sacramento
at midnight and I told him and his crew that I was "99% sure"
it was on at Bonny Doon.  He left Sacramento right then and god 
knows how long it took him to get there. I was there myself 
from 1:00am until 4:15am, waiting and waiting. There were several 
rumours to be sampled there among the crowd. One was that the 
FM was right then underway at Auto Mall Parkway in Fremont. 
Not many people believed this and so stayed on the beach on the 
off chance it would happen late.

I was at the non-starter FM in late September that was moved from
Palo Alto to 2 different sites in Fremeont, each one being shut
down. Therefore I found it hard to believe that Fremont's finest
would be any more tolerant this time around. So I stayed on the 
beach too. 

People hung around outside their cars, listened to music, talked.
The usual stimulants were available. Unfortunately, I have to 
work after these FM's and so I stick to adrenalin and the music 
to keep me awake until 6:00am each time ! Of course, last night 
that didn't work, and so at 4:15am I gave up and drove back 
over the hill. I was not very happy about it, cursed the fact 
that we can't get the communication lines sorted out a bit better. 

Ah well, always next month. I'd be grateful for anyone else's news
experiences of last night. And any ideas on how we can prevent such
disappointment and wasted time again.

Each month the rumor circulates that the Full Moon will be at Bonny Dune,
since it is held there about 3 or 4 times out of the year, these rumors
have a 25% - 33% chance of being right on any particular Full Moon.
It is funny that this person had this info at 10:00 p.m.,
the final decision wasn't made by WICKED until about 11:00 p.m.

Unless you know someone in WICKED (or know someone who knows someone)
then you cannot be CERTAIN of the location, this FMR was intentionally
vague because WICKED didn't want 2000+ people.  In any event, it WAS at
Auto Mall Parkway and would have been a nice party if the sound truck
had showed up on time.  I was there from about 2:15 on. By 3:15
the cops had showed up (but still no sound) They dispersed everyone and
we all wound up in a 7-11 parking lot near 880. Waiting to reconnect with
the sound truck, I waited till about 4:30 after which it was discovered
that some people were looting an A.M./P.M. store near the 7-11, I got out
of there cuz I knew the cops would be pissed.

Fremonts finest said "You know if you guys had started earlier and had
not had all the people milling around, it would have been O.K."
I know for a fact that there have been remegades in Fremont that have
been successful, WICKED needs to get their act together as far as
timely execution is concerned, it is the primary cause of these parties
not going off.

As far as Bonny Dune or any location, the purpose is to keep you guessing and
TO NOT BE OBVIOUS.  There are plenty of parties that the date, time and
location are readily available, the FMR is a renegade, don't listen
to people who don't know what they are talking about.

Wicked is thinking about suspending the FMRs because they are getting
too big and people come expecting them to provide a party as opposed to
the way it use to be which were all the participants participated in
putting the party on.  Only time will tell what will happen.  If you
are unhappy, maybe you should start throwing your own FMRs.

Well, as Geoff said, throwing your own FMR is always an option so I did
something of the sort myself last night, putting in nearly three hours
on the practice decks.  And the tapes sound pretty tasty indeed :)

We'll have a real FMR here in Portland sometime in 1994, that I promise.
Of course, we probably can't do an outside one until June, given the

Well, throwing a party, even a renegade, is a non-trivial exercise :-)

Also, based on portions of conversations I've had repeated to me, 
Wicked isn't exactly THRILLED with the idea of people throwing competing 
FMRs.  But maybe this feeling has altered what with the changes that huge 
attendance has wrought on the nature of the Wicked FMR? Would someone 
closer to the Wicked source care to comment?

An alternative (or better yet, supplement) is to try attending other, 
smaller, successful renegade parties such as Fluid Grooves or Atomic 
Dog/Rooster.  Both of these will be appearing at points in the future, 
stay tuned to this list for info.

People come out of the woodwork for the Wicked/FMRs because they know it
is a magickal experience.  The magick provided by Wicked can be strong and 
beautiful, but I submit that other renegade experiences can be quite
freeing, uplifting, beautiful, and of their own sort of magick, too.
Give it a chance -- come out for them once and see.

Geoff, Laura, Bob,

Thanks for your replies. Perhaps I'd better clarify a few things, 
cos from the way I read your reply, Geoff, I sense a tone 
of reproval.

As it happened, this person had the wrong information, but then
they never claimed that they were 100% sure of where it was on.
I was grateful for what they could tell me; and continue to be.
Nor did I claim, when I spoke to the guy in Sacramento, that
I was sure where it was on. I feel bad for the guy though, and
I must admit I didn't think it funny at all.

Look, I went to the place I did because I didnt know better. 
D'ya know what ? I had an even dimmer idea of where the previous 
month's FM was, and had no way of finding out, so what did I do ? 
I drove off down to Bonny doon in the pissing rain anyway, on 
the off chance I might find out where it was. No luck.

Not "certain" I can deal with, as I have up to now. The precise level
of vagueness is something I'll leave to others. What I was asking,
however, was some input from others on how I might combat this
level of vagueness.  By e-mail back to me if necessary, if people 
feel uncomfortable discussing this in a public forum.

Keep me guessing ? That's fine by me, if they are held at the same
place all the time, they will probably lose the 'magic' in some
way, as it were. As regards listening to people who don't know what
they are talking about, well, since my (new) friend (who shall remain
nameless) is, as far as I know, one of those who helped originate
the SF scene, I would hardly say he doesn't know what he is talking
about. I'd just like to know if there if there is some other
way I can be a bit more hopeful that I can actually make it there.

I think we are on dangerous ground here, and I wonder if there
are elements within wicked that have considered this...
If mystery and personal-connections are to be used to keep down 
the number of attendees, well, it's wickeds party, I'll accept their 
decision.  Only if that's what they are going to do, perhaps they might
softpedal all the stuff about the family, diversity, inclusiveness
etc., since such sentiments hardly sit well with such a policy.
And as someone who invariably also attends the pay-in parties,
I think less-connected people like me deserve to have their
interests considered when it comes to the FM ?

I am a realtively recent arrival in the bay area, and stumbled on
the FM's by chance. I have the utmost respect for a group of
creative people who go out of their way and to some expense to
throw a bit of a party for the 'community' they are a part of,
and the chances are that they personally know only a small
percentage of the attendees (like me). The music is just fab 
but for me the dedication and mindset that (I think) goes 
into setting the FM's up is really a testament to the SF scene.

I do not go to a FM expecting to be entertained, nor do I go
because of anything else you can get there, or because they
are free. I go because of the people you can find there, the 
camaraderie, the art/craft of the dj's, the beautiful Bonny 
doon setting, and so on.  Personally I would like the opportunity 
to help in some way, but because I know virtually no-one in the 
scene, it isn't easy for me.  [Well, once I went off and got 
water for a guy (I didn't know him) who seemed to be in 
desperate need of some liquids and who was all alone but for 
one friend who wanted to remain with him.]

I look forward to these and other events a lot, and since I
didn't make it home this Xmas/New Year, the FM was hopefully
going to make up for it in some way. So I write from that kind
of frustration, because these events are such a revelation.
I do not write with the frustration of someone who wants to 
party on and is pissed because wicked don't come up with the
goods.

I figured there must be a debate on within the wicked organisation
regarding the wisdom of continuing with the FM's. I too heard
the msg on their info-line about no booze, nitrous or fireworks
for the Halloween FM. And I saw that on that occasion there
was copious evidence of the booze and nitrous and I heard and 
saw a few fireworks as well. I expect too there is a sentiment
abroad within the posse that the FM is becoming too large. 
I can understand why they might be close to bringing this phase 
of the burgeoning SF scene to a close. So... since I know the 
feeling I felt at my first and subsequent FM's is not to be 
had too easily these days, and since I expect that they wont 
exactly go on forever, I would like to get to all I can 
while they last. I s'pose in some ways I think of them as
analagous to a shooting star, beautiful while it lasts, 
but shortlived.

And I'll be the first person to support wicked if they decided
to stop holding them if they are allegedly attracting an
element which is going to loot a store.

Laura, I'd love to attend any and all such events you name. 
I dont expect that the FM is the only event/place where 
the things I value are manifested. I'd gladly help out as well,
if I can. Keep me posted.

Not reproval, but bear in mind that it is a dificult situation,
if the directions are really accessable then LOTS of people come and
especially LOTS of clueless people come.  This was an attempt to only spread
the word by word of mouth, it worked, the FMR was the right size, but
it didn't go off.

I don't know how that rumor got started, I have thought in the past of
seeding disinformation but Brian B. convinced me that that was an
assholish thing to do.

The previous month's FMR was canceled.  It never happened so you
didn't miss anything.

WICKED tends to view the FMR as "their" party, something free that they
give back to all the people who go out and support their paying parties.
Most people who go out regularly have no problem finding out where the FMR is.
You might try going out more or making friends with those that do,

If they told you Bonnie Dune I don't know where he got that from,
WICKED doesn't particularly like Bonnie Dune because of the LONG haul that
they have to make in the morning to get the equipment out of the beach.
They have FMR's there because they have so far been bust free and it is
a sure thing, this is something that is used sparingly, they don't want to
stress the location or the law enforcement around there which has looked
the other way for the last couple of years.

It is a touchy situation, have you ever tried to be responsible for a party
with over 1400 people with NO police. Well when it's "family" there's no
problem, the people that use to come to the FMR would look out for each
other and the party at large, now we get a LARGE amount of people who come
to get fucked up and to stand around and be cool.  It is too hard to manage all
the nitrous, fireworks, fights and stuff that sending wide invites
brings in.  Indeed the scene has changed, maybe it's time for there to be
several full moons. why do people think that WICKED is the only group
to throw a FMR?

I think WICKED is getting tired of shouldering the responsibility alone,
except for me and a couple of others no-one helps to park cars anymore,
I can't manage 2000+ people all by myself especially when you have a large
contingent that just want to be entertained and don't want to take
responsibility for the party as a whole.  That is why there is talk of
taking it underground once again (or just not having it).

Folk let me remind you that the FIRST rave ever at Bonnie Dune was put on by
SFRAVES not WICKED.  Many of the FMR sites were found by Brian, myself or
other SFR personel.  If you want the vibe that a renegade can offer,
ORGANIZE and THROW your OWN! :) It can be done, and I bet it can be done better
than WICKED.  There is ample DJ talent out there, there are KIDS just as
good as Jeno or Markie that never get to play to a large crowd.
Give them a chance.

I for one, am glad to see the FMM crew getting back to their roots.  Yeah,
in time the crowd will get larger, but right now FMR is WAAAY to big, with
waaay to many cracker-jacks.

Until it does get larger, it's better they attempt to drive it deeper
underground.

Hell, the way I look at it, if you know you get to go!

Maybe now I may go to another, and give it another try once the crowds have
gotten smaller.

(I smell a better '94 already!)

Uh huh.  It is really ridiculous the way things are now.  I remeber a party
(a couple) out in vallejo where there were some alot of people, (around
500-600), but it felt really comfortable and everyone was really in that
family vibe.  Tons of old school, but plenty of new jacks as well.
Everyone was really cool with each other, and that's what I hope they
return to.

In all fairness to the people who are part of Wicked as well, it is good to
see that they put something back into that which they are apart of.  I
think that it is one of the more positive aspects of the scene.  I hope
they continue FMM's.  And I hope they do the same with the Wicked shows.
Getting back to the roots...who knows '94 may be the year of consolidation.

I certainly hope so!

(P.S.  I don't like massives. 2000 people is too much IMO...yeech!),

Even free parties hate competition.  But I think it's more of a
turf/posse/egotrip thang than anything else.  There's always room for
another, if anyone has the guts, and the deep pockets to pull it off (FMM
are FREE! & DJ's don't get paid).

[deleted]

>People come out of the woodwork for the Wicked/FMRs because they know it
>is a magickal experience.

Not to be combative (yeah, right ;), but I think that the large portion of
people come out because it is FREE.  You put FREE on anything and you get
all types of "things" crawling out.  These are generally people who do
little to support the scene.  You hardly ever see these people at the
parties you attend...why?  Becuase it's 3,5,7,10,15, or $20 to get in.  Or
some other reason.

I think FMM are symbiotic.  The boys/girls thrown them to give back and to
create an experince.  But it would not be possible if, on other "paying"
nights, everyone stays home.  That's why (and a thing I have about
trompling over stuff) I stay away from them.  Becuase so many of the people
who go these days wouldn't know Jeno from Josh (and it IS important to know
who's who at the FMM. The least you can do is KNOW your host!).  And so
many of the pople who attend do very little in supproting their hosts
(attendance has fallen, except at FMM).  I know that there are many reasons
why things are the way they are, but the realtionship of FMM to the
guests/family has turned from a symbiotic relationship into a parasite/host
paradigm.

Unfortunate.  But by driving it underground it will get back to it's roots.
Back to those who supported, and continue to support their efforts.
Fair-weather-ravers/partygoers watch out.

Agreed.  Need more of 'em...but partying in the lot with many Grateful Dead
family members is not my cup of tea (really, no slam intended for the Dead
Family who may reside of SFR).  But I will try a Liquid Air when it comes
back from hiatus, and I'll have directions to boot (heehee)!

Hear, hear! having multiple full moons was suggested quite some time ago
on this list (archive reference, anyone?), and is one which i fully
support.  

As for my reasons for never pushing/pulling for another FMR, i can tell
you this: 

1.  practical--if everyone knows wicked will throw an FMR, and 200 people
    hear about someone else doing an FMR, which will the 200 go to? unless
    those 200 are your nearest and dearest, they will go to wicked's FMR.

2.  for the scene--why throw a "competing" event?  the wicked FMR has been a 
    mainstay in the area for quite some time.  i had no desire to attempt to
    pry people away from their friends and from the wicked FMR experience.
    family shouldn't have to "choose" sides. i also had no desire to thumb
    my nose at the wicked posse--they chose the event, let everyone know
    they would always try to do an FMR, so why step on their event? friends
    don't do that to each other.

3.  personal--i have to work for a living, and throwing events that can 
    occur on any day of the week or having to travel for business just
    doesn't allow for the commitment to throw regularly scheduled events.

I'm also glad to hear the some people in the wicked posse have finally
realized they're a little deficient in the logistics aspect of throwing
renegades.  Having helped organize a few small parties myself, getting
DJs, a sound system, etc. is the easy part; the challenge is getting all
that stuff and all those people exactly where you want them, exactly when
they *must* be there.  i wish wicked every success in their endeavors, and
offer my skills should they require them.

and, now the door is open for others to do FMRs in the bay area, look for
something from the fluid groove posse sometime next year.

I like well done fast music.

In fact, I like and can dance to just about any kind of music that isn't
boring and repetitive, and sometimes even the latter is nice.

The only thing that really slows me down is un-beat-matched music, but
that can happen at any speed.

I dance differently at different speeds.  In fact, I *dance* less at
the faster speeds but move more.

When I hear unfamiliar music, my first thought is, *in what possible way
can this music be enjoyed?*  Usually I find the mindset, and get into it.
I get deeper into some songs than others, but that usually has more to
do with tones and sounds than speed.

The only thing that KILLS is a lack of variety or openness.

Some people know what they like and that's that.  One wonders how they
ever came to like that music in the first place :)

It's just music.  It doesn't hurt to actually try and like it.

Based on conversations I've had, I don't think they'd mind other FMR's
on the same night, especially now since EVERYONE and their dog wants
to go to them (ack!  no offense, Bob R.  Your dog is great!).  It's
still just a party to them - they get no financial benefit from it,
and the party will be strong if 200 or 2000 people show up.  So if
another party with other DJ's decided they wanted to try and do it, it
probably wouldn't be a problem.  The thing to remember is that the
people in wicked have worked HARD at creating a specific flavor and
vibe, and that's what became legendary.  It's a lot more than simply
showing up with a sound system on a beach.  I have talked with them
before about this, also about why they rarely deviate from Garth-Jeno-
Markie, and it's basically because they really get a lot out of the
combination they've found.  I happen to usually enjoy the combination,
and sometimes the music is so fantastic and so consistant I can see how
that combo can be as fundamental as peanut butter and jelly and bread.
But it's not impossible, and I'd rather go to a well-organized 200-300
person FMR than the wicked ones recently.  And I wouldn't try it until
April or so when it's warmer.

I mean, there is a lot of significane to the concept of the FMR being
"the" party, the regular mobile Woodstocks of our generation, the one
party where everyone wants to go and the normal cliques in the scene
get dissolved, but that gets counterbalanced by the increasingly 
difficult logistics and the degradation of spirit that happens when it
gets moved around a lot.  

Just remember to put the heart in the right place, and define yourself
and your paradigm by who you are, not by what you're not.  

The SF scene can definitely support more than one FMR.

Just great. I've been grumbling about FMRs for a long time (and haven't
actually attended one in a long time, due to nerd-dom, work, hassle, etc),
and this kind of shit is precisely why I've been grumbling about FMRs. I've
really had it with all this "gangsta" shit that seems to be going down at
certain raves. You know, the pushy, speed freak, young toughs, shirtless
male hunter-gatherers, or their brassiere-and-booty "gangsta moll" female
counterparts.

As far as I'm concerned, the "vibe" of FMRs is gone, and has been gone (for
me) since the really cool series of FMRs held in the hills near Pinole
during the summer of '92. 

What I find bothersome is the rumor I heard that the FMR-dudes explicitly
didn't want the FMR info spread through email or our phone tree due to the
potential of attracting too many people. For me, it is precisely these
people (you all) that I would want to have at a party. If anything, I'd
like to see the "word" NOT SPREAD to the lame-ass gangsta toughs that have
glommed on to the Wicked scene. 

And maybe, just maybe, by doing this, you'd avoid the
fireworks-in-the-parking-lot, nitrous-huffin', AM/PM-lootin',
Camaro-drivin', speed-freak, attitude-assholes that have turned raving back
towards the lameness of clubland. Or not.

Information spreads thru the computer much quicker than you think.  Some,
and I mean some, people know that I am on the SFR list.  They often ask me
to look at the weeks rave guide to find out what's up (uh huh, even from
some of the people you would consider "connected").  So I think that they
are QUITE wise not to have it spread electronically.  The phone is the best
way.  And knowing the right people is also another good way.  Let's face
it.  If you've been going out for 1 or 2 years now, and have not made
connections then....it's not so important to have FMM member's phone
number, BUT you have got to know at least 1 or two people who know them.
Even if the person is one removed from knowing any of them personally,
connections don't hurt.  Isn't that what this whole thoing is
about...connecting, communicating, and keeping a family vibe?

I have always had it in for many of the newbies who join the scene.  Not
everyone mind you, but just those who are H.O's (hangers on), and are
clueless as to whats what, even after attending more than one event.  THEY
are the ones who are doin the fireworks (assholes), shirtless hg's
(assholes), nitrous sniffing (stoopid)/selling(assholes) and have
effectively made this scene ever more cliqueish [sp];

As things become more selective (thank g-d!), the numbers will decrease,
but the quality will increase. That can only be seen as a good thing, for
now.

John

I'm a little confused here.  Either the looting was done by nonFMravers
who coincidentally picked that spot to commit violence, or the looting was
done by ravers who *are* connected, and are supposedly a part of the 
Wicked "family".  I hope it's the former.

This question was posed in the past.  And the past answer from Wicked
included statements like "there are 27 other phases of the moon, pick
one of them for your party" and "the FMR is a community event, having 
more than one would break up the community."  So perhaps this is partly
why people haven't tried.  Now, I don't have a direct line to Wicked, I
am only repeating what was repeated to me, so I'm sorry if I'm 
misrepresenting things.

And if you can't organize and throw your own, or don't want to, then 
support the existing renegade posses.  Part of why Fluid Grooves/Liquid Air
is on hiatus is because we weren't getting support.  Now, the onus is on
the organizers to get the word out, and that's one of the things we're 
working on.  We aren't giving up.

In fact, I'm working on it right now in this message :-)  

STORM in NYC went through something a tiny bit similar to Wicked.  The Storm 
Raves kept getting bigger and bigger and attracted more and more people who
would show up with Angel Dust and cases of beer and stand around drinking
and drugging rather than dancing and making friends.  So, a year ago
Storm stopped.  They spent the summer throwing tiny free outdoor parties.
The only way you could find out about them was to either ask in their
record store (Groove Records) or be on Heather Heather's 100-person
mailing list.  The idea was that the core group of ravers that Heather 
invited would spread the word to their friends, so as to cut down on
people who come in the wrong spirit.  It worked quite well.  The parties
had about 200-300 people, and not a one of them suffered from untimely busts
(who cares if a party that started at 11 pm gets busted at 7.30 am?).  So my 
point of all this is that I totally understand what Wicked is going through, and
support whatever actions they deem necessary to get their events to be
the way they want them.  Even if it means I'll never be able to find another
FMR again.

But getting back to San Francisco:  a large part of why Fluid Grooves/Liquid
Air got started was to provide that kind of renegade experience to the
sfraves-list community and their friends.  We'd like it to work along the
same lines as what Heather did:  we mail info to the core group of
approximately 250 sfravers.  You all pass the word on to your friends.  It
could work quite well!  Since Liquid Air doesn't have the background that
Storm or Wicked has, however, we do realize we will have to do a lot of
communication with people off the sfraves-list to get things off the ground.

I really think Liquid Air is a good thing, and is worth giving up one
night of the usual SF club/rave circuit to check out.   Because we're smaller
we have more flexibility for finding sites.   We use Ethan's Sound Vision
system, and I PROMISE you it's of EXCEPTIONALLY high quality.  At past parties
there has been plenty of water and even breakfast food (juice and muffins or 
croissaints) in the morning.  The DJs are varied, focussing on talent other
than the current SF superstars:  we've had people like Tamara (from this
list), Susan (from Your Sister's House), and Jon Drukman.

I am so excited about the prospect of more Liquid Air parties once it gets
warmer, let me tell you!  There is NOTHING like dancing all night outdoors
and then having the sun come up during a smooth dreamy trancey set.  So
keep us in mind!

Know what? Every time that the FMR HAS NOT been posted, we have a reasonable
sized crowd.  At this last party I saw plenty of the "Family" and NONE
of them have net access.  The bottom line is that when it is posted, it 
can be distributed far and wide and can be copied and xeroxed.  I think jsl
is right, if you don't know someone by now, (or know someone, who knows
someone) then maybe you should think about that.  If the FMR returns to being
a PRIVATE party (which is what it was in the first place, an open BUT
private party) as oppose to a PUBLIC spectacle, all the better, no-one on
this list has any excuse to complain about not finding out, many of you
know who to call who will definately know what's up.  If you can't put yourself
out for a little human contact then maybe you really don't want to go that
badly.  The bottom line is WICKED would rather have a party with 100 people
who don't bring nitrous, fireworks, cars that go boom and have a really
good vibey party then to continue to throw massives that are tending to slide
out of control with the majority of people not caring.  As far as the list,
well I know that most of the vocal people on the list ARE NOT the gangsta type
(I don't know about you jsl, you seem to be gettin more Bras n' Booty then
any of us ;) but the ones who are complaining about not getting e-mail
I *KNOW* can find out where the party is by placing a couple of phone calls.
I might add that I have never denied directions to the FMR to anyone who has
called me, (whether I knew them or not). 

My personal opinion is that WICKED should give the FMR a rest for the winter
and regroup and bring it out (underground) in the spring.  This would be an
excellent opportunity for someone else to take up the slack or to try
their hand at throwing a luna renegade.  Any takers?

At the recent Atomic Rooster the number of "ravers" (so called "old school"
too, I might add) *far* outweighed the number of deadheads! However, not
not to overplay this point, I'm happy to dance with whoever feels like
dancing :)

Aw, nemesis is a shriekback song, not an SFRaver :-)

ObFullMoonMusings: If Wicked doesn't want to distribute the info via
SFRaves then that's their prerogative.  It seems really anal to me,
particularly since (as Niels said) most of the people I like to see at
raves are on this list; still, Geoff is right, a phone call to find out
where to go isn't a big hassle.  Hell, Geoff offered, call him!!! :-)

Rather than try to describe the mayhem which will be goin' down on New
Year's, I've compiled a handy-dandy smart-shopper's clip-out guide to
New Year's.  If you don't want to deal with tons o' boozin' yuppies
and gangstas, maybe the SFR party, Jazid Up, or Mission Rock might be
the best bets (musique should be great all around though).  Also
Boogie Buffet the next morning, and try to recover for Come/Unity on
Wednesday!

Happy New Year everyone!

Subject: House Party--Wanna Spin
Status: 

Greetings Friends and DJs,

As a much needed alternative to Cruel World and Funky Too-Expensive Tekno
Tribe (Organik) I suggest a House Party on the night of Saturday January
15th. Said party would either be at my house which we've done before
successfully and has plenty of room, or, depending on response, at the
space Giamma used for his recent party (subject to availability so plz get
back to me ASAP). Should you all be interested, the lineup would include:

  M-Normal
  Giamma
  Brian
  Jon D
  Lee
  Ethan
  Meme
  Mescalina
  Amit
  Tamara
  Laura
  (if I forgot you, and you wanna spin, I'm sorry, plz mail me)

In either location we would use two rooms, one with dance music and one
ambient. Needless to say *your* input is not only welcome, but requested;
we can do whatever *we* want to. We could use some visuals, so visuals
people take note :) We'll need DATs, so tapers take note...

This party will not be fliered. I think that between us and our friends we
will have more than enough people to fill either space. If you are
interested, plz RSVP me via private e-mail or phone, and please, if you're
gonna play, if you're gonna come: tell some friends, bring some friends. 

As a final note, and this may sound tweaky but... please don't RSVP unless
you're going to make this your destination for the night; it's really
frustrating to put a lot of effort into throwing a party and then having
everybody stop by for an hour on their way to the "real" $20 party. This
doesn't mean you're not welcome if this is what you plan to do, however,
I'd like to try and get an accurate count of the night's core group. If
you'd like to withold your RSVP until the lineup firms up a little, stay
tuned, I'll keep ya posted. Nuff said.

peace always
ethan

PS: apologies to those of you who get this in triplicate (you're just on
too many lists goddamn it!)   ;)

Count me in on helping. I probably won't be able to manhandle
too much gear, but I can think of lots of other things I could do.

Regarding the variety of music played at the events you are
involved with. The music that is played at the majority of events
I attend in the bay area is great and all, but there is definitely
room for a little more variety. Personally, I love to listen to 
(blush) some jungle/hardcore every now and again. There's nothing like
a tape of London's Eruption FM featuring the Cuckoo spinning a
bit 'o the drum 'n the bass, to get my eyes bulging when I'm 
sleepily driving to work in the mornings !

Now it would be *cool* if I knew where I could catch some of
this being spun. And I know I'm probably in a tiny minority
for even expressing a vague attraction to this sound (makes
me feel like admitting I like Heavy Metal), but who cares,
I like it and that's that.  Value differences, diversity etc. 
I reckon there's a Ph D in social anthropology lurking there 
for anyone who cares to do some research into why this genre 
is so popular in the UK and unloved elsewhere.

> If you can't put yourself out for a little human contact

Hey Geoff, my interpersonal skills aren't that bad ! I have 
actually spoken to people I don't know when I go out. Not that
easy when you have an accent like mine :-). F'r instance at the
hallowe'en FM I thumbed from the beach up the road to Davenport 
at 3am to call my girlfriend and tell her to get down there because 
it was going off. I got a lift there and back from two great women
in a jeep. [Not wanting to give the CHP an excuse to stop
the party, I had parked about 3 miles up the Bonnydoon road
rather than near the beach.] Also later that night I spoke
to the english guy (soft-spoken, his voice is on the Wicked
line, sorry, dunno his name) who seems to be a core member of 
wicked and that's how I picked up the feeling that they are not 
pleased with several aspects of the FM's, like
	 1) the nitrous
	 2) the size of the crowd, and the attendant parking problems
	 3) the possible over-commercialization of the SF scene
	    and ths house scene in general.
[Aside:The last point is something that I think will assume greater
importance as the major record companies and corporate/establishment
entertainment organizations get their interest piqued here.]
I didn't feel comfortable asking this guy for his/some phone number
right then so that I can know when/where the FM is on. That
wasn't the reason I was talking to him, and so I left it at that.

I look forward to going to a much greater variety of events in 1994
and making a more visibly actibe role as a proponent of what we
all love about this thing.

DJs include

	deadly budda from pittsburg (breakbeat)

	heather heart from Brooklyn

Heather Heart is the woman I was babbling about before.  She's got the
vibe of Liz Roberts, a huge heart, an adorable smile, and a thick 
Brooklyn accent.  Best of all, she puts together mind-crunching sets
that include house, old school acid, trance, and hardcore.  YES, all
in the same set!  And she makes it all work.

All you techno heads who were saying they miss the faster beats, you
really should check this out.  The number is (415) - 979 - 8411 .

I'm going to be there, that's for sure!  Yippeeeee!

OK, let's see if I've got this right... the FMM is a community event,
it's just that the community's grown so large that they have to keep
95% of it in the dark about where it's happening so they don't show
up?  Including many people that pay (repeatedly) to go to Wicked?

The Orwellian doublespeak in this scene is getting thick enough to
cut with a Stanton stylus...

Look at what happened the other night:  despite the tightest location
control yet, the trouble makers had no trouble finding the action
(or lack thereof).

C'mon Wicked, you can't have your cake and eat it too.  If there are
so many people who want to party on the Full Moon that you have to
hide your location from them, what do you care if they go to someone
else's (better publicized) party instead?

And who knows?  The other party might even start on time and not
get busted!  =)

I think the real unspoken issue here is about locations; after all,
if it's this hard to find one bust-proof location, imagine how hard
trying to find two!  And that's why I say to Brian and Geoff (over and
over) why are you spending so much energy and time scouting locations
for a party you have NO other control over???

--------

For you more recent subscribers, this discussion is virtually a
point-for-point replay of the one that led to Connection I in August
'92, a party that for many of us equalled the finest FMM's (check the
FTP archives).  So the conclusion seems fairly obvious.

Subject: FMM / Space Lab tonite? any takers?
Status: 


FMM, my two cents for the day: No information, I can understand. 
Misinformation and deception, I cannot (though Wicked themselves are 
rarely responsible for this). I would gladly give them up for a while 
if they would get smaller again as a result. And as far as competing 
parties...since when did we need to use the moon as an excuse for one? 
Sure, it's a great night to have it, but there are plenty of other nights 
and reasons too. And honestly, it ain't all that hard to put something 
together. The only hassle is finding a space (well, and lugging gear). 
I've only thrown two back in Detroit (one on only five hours notice), so 
if I can do it anyone can. It doesn't have to be flashy, just fun. I'm 
getting the itch again, but know few folks out here, so if I can help 
anyone else out, I'm all yours. Gruntwork, whatever... All in all, It's 
about time to start a new tradition in SF. (or maybe just another)

Now on to current business (we've still got 20-some odd days to debate 
the FMM). Is anybody going to SpaceLab tonight? If so, say hi. I'll be 
wearing the current corporate headgear (my trusty, dusty 'jughead' hat).

Subject: my last thoughts on the FM; and some other subjects
Status: 


Looks like I started a discussion which bubbles up occasionally. 
The old chestnut of how to restrict access without becoming
elitist or cliqueish. 

This is in some ways related to the current debate (all together,
jump mentally with me here) on certain aspects of immigration policy. 
Personally I believe there is great strength in massive diversity.
Those strengths can even be difficult to see early on in a
particular immigration wave.  And then some time later, a society
can see itself as greatly enriched in a multitude of ways by the
presence of whole communities.  To take a simple example, I don't
believe it's an accident that the UK youth fashion/culture has
been important in a global-sense in the post WWII years.  The 
influences on UK popular music by west-indian (african) beats, 
melodies and forms has lead after many twists and turns from
reggae thru punk thru breakbeat.  Would there have been a PiL
a Jah Wobble or the Orb without such diverse influences ?

This leads me, in a round-about way, to the discussion on the
"hunter-gatherer" types and their "gangsta-molls".  I get the 
main point that's being made, but I'm a little worried by where this 
thought leads.  I always thought that it didn't matter how cool 
or uncool you dressed or looked.  Back home in Ireland, the best 
vibe was always in the darkest areas of clubs, even on the stairs, 
where people just danced and cared not what their fellow ravers wore. 
I think this acceptance should also be afforded by default (until each
individual proves otherwise) to those who like to strip-off for 
the night, or want to wear something which in their opinion 
is glamorous.  And I write as someone who wouldn't know 
what the inside of a gym looks like !  Look at it this way, if you
spent your week packing beef, or pumping gas, or filling insurance
forms or typing in front of a screen, then I think that you bloody
well deserve to dress/undress any way you like when you go out, 
and you should of course respect the rights of others as well.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that individuals from this caste
can be part of and perhaps enrich a scene too.

Personally, I've never been directly intimidated or pushed around 
at any SF event. Maybe you folks have.  But I am loathe to 
generalize by appearance, by what car you drive, or by any other 
handle.

One other thing that still puzzles me.  If access to the information
regarding the location of the FM is to be restricted, why does
the wicked line always let all callers know when the next FM is
going to be held, inviting the callers to "keep 'em peeled" ?
Surely if you are going to restrict access, changing the msg
would be the obvious first step ?

Again, I'd like to emphasize that I appreciate very much what 
wicked do, the only thing that bothered me was me missing
the chance to mingle with you all the other night.

So... I think I'd like to spend some more time talking one-on-one
to some of you folks on your experiences of organizing small renegades
in the next few months.  I'd like to take an organising hand in some 
sort of get-together at some time next year.  I'm sure there are 
lots of simple yet not-so-obvious do's and dont's to be learnt. 
Once that groundwork is done, we can maybe scope out a space and 
off we go.

But if I have anything to do with it, the main focus will be on the 
music, not too much verbiage about, y'know, dancing together in 
unison to celebrate the harvest or whatever. Being an atheist
battle-hardened by catholic school, I am sensitive to those 
quasi-religious references ;-)

another brief sojurn on the soapbox.

once again, this last FMR was NOT publicized through the normal email
and phone means through SFR.  i am fairly involved with SFR and the
scene and, for better or worse, not a single one of my friends went to
this FMR.

i guess what i'm trying to say is that mr. kennedy didn't miss the
opportunity to hang out with the SFR posse, because near as i can
tell, none of us were there.  (well, not enough for us to touch our
magic rings together and get our super-secret vibe-enhancing powers
goin'.)  and i guess i'm also trying to say that since the event
didn't go off, you actually didn't miss anything.

Paul F. Kennedy said
> the only thing that bothered me was me missing the chance to mingle

so i guess re-reading this is that you did miss the ** chance ** but
in actuality, by missing the chance, you didn't miss anything.
shaving hairs, yep, can you tell i studied philosophy :-)

finally, i think you'll be pleasantly surprised at the both the
expertise of certain people on the list at throwing renegades and
their willingness to have people help.  every renegade event i've ever
been to could have used more people a) loading gear after the event b)
cleaning up during / after the event and c) helping people park.  (and
i'm sure people on this list could come up with a handful of other
things which can always use extra hands...)

my suspicion is that the calendar will become a lot more crowded in
April, as it always does...

yow!  see you all out this weekend!  me, i'm still undecided, but it's
looking like boogie buffet is a given.  i'm considering
spundae/wicked, jazid up (same location as bb could be a big plus or a
big minus depending on mindset) and mission rock, as well as the Santa
Cruz thang.

and if i can get off this machine and stop being a weenie, i may make
it to spacelab.

Our experiences with Sharons have not been all that great, but they have 
thrown one or two that were quite good. The good ones have all been 
outdoors. When Sharons go indoors, it's pretty much indistinguishable 
from anything else costing twenty bucks. They had one out on a farm (with 
it's own small lake) near Stockton in 92 that was great. One of my fonder 
memories of that summer. And the Gardner's Grove ones were nice. 
Unfortunately, while we had a great time at the last one there, all the 
directions got screwed up and nobody really ended up showing (for a 
three-day event). In the end, they ended up not paying any of security or 
the live acts (some of them our friends) which was a big no-no. Would I 
go again? I dunno. It would depend if it was outdoors or not. If it was 
indoors, I'd probably pass...

Synergy - These (Tony & Allen) guys came out of nowhere, and have redefined
the standard by which video mixing is judged.  Excellent videos, efx,
timing, and look, make these guys fun to watch anytime.  And great to watch
when you're crackin' on.

Best "Spiritual" Moment:
Fire at the VISON on July 4, 1993 - This event is getting as popular as the
birth of Jesus.  A fire happened because a cracker jack lit a fire cracker,
or skyrocket (the story varies).  A whole bunch of people ran up the hill
to stop the fire that resulted.  The bravery of the people involved (no
names) reaches near mythic proportions when spoken of by some.  Martin gave
a sppech, hands were held, and the event went on.  The event itself is
often used as a metaphor of "common good" that people say is part of the
house movement.

* I would add more of my own comments, but I don't want to be branded a
heretic ;)

There are more bests, but these are all for now.

I look forward to '94...there will be major shit going down:

DJ's to watch out for are John Howard, and Loren.  They are both new, and
both kick ass.  It will be interesting to see how hard they fuck thing up
in '94!

Tony will be the man in '94.  His shit has been so pumped ALL during '93
that '94 is gonna be all Tony's.  Good DJ, selection, mood, he works it!

Doran will be another one to watch!  D plays mostly at Martins gigs, but
'93 saw him getting out (as in state) alot more and coming back stronger
each time.  '94 will be good to him!  His have gotten more on the harder
edge,good show!

I'm done with the acronym IMO.  It's stupid and does not sound like regular
speech.  Especially since I do not use such passive verbage when I speak to
people.  It is not something I use in daily speech so it's dropped.  If you
have to have someone TELL you what is opinion and what is fact, then you're
in alot of trouble.

I'd like to hear more Alfie, James, Derrick Carter, and Mark Farina this year.

I'd like to see 3 turntable's being worked instead of 2.

I'd like to give the world a Coke, and keep it company.

Yeah, I wish we could have made it down to the mansion, but our Valiant 
Grafittimobile was being a little ornery, so we thought it best to stay within
wallking distance should she decide to take an unexpected rest. 

We ended up going to Wicked and although it *was* overpriced, a couple 
wierd things happened. I'm 21+, but Carmen is not, so we we're worried 
about her not getting in. (wicked was supposedly 21+ until 2:30). We'll 
if she was gonna get in, it had to be early, so we spun down there about 
9:30 and got near the front of the line. When they let people in they 
turned away at least a half-dozen folks ahead of us, but let her in. The 
guy said it was $25 (gulp), but when we got to the window two twenties 
slapped on the counter got us two tickets back. Oh well, little 
pleasures. We took it as a sign and ended up having a pretty good time. 
One of the bartenders outside was actually my landlord, so we got fed free 
juice all night - handy after the party favors kicked in.

The crowd wasn't unusually bad. Lots of two-fisted drinkin frat boys and 
consulate types, though. And sorry folks, breakdancing is breakdancing no 
matter what you call it an' it's just OLD.

A great summation of 93 last night. Now let's look forward to 94. JMAR.

Hey, folks.  Just thought you might want to know that Eber Electronics
in San Francisco has a cache of Sony MDR-V6 headphones *in stock*.  I
was drooling over various equipment today, and looked behind the counter
to see 5 pair on the rack.   These headphones are generally regarded in
the DJ trade as *the* phones to have. They are compact, give a good, flat
frequency response, and are reasonably priced.  Eber's usual price is $100.
Today and tomorrow (January 2nd), they are "on sale" at $70.  Catch 'em
while you can, since I believe this model has been discontinued.  For
you folks who prefer the V600 series, those are also available.

Just some information from a concerned citizen.  I am in no way associated
with Eber, just one of their satisfied customers.  I believe they have a
shop in Menlo Park, too.

They people who do Sharon are slime.  In April '92 they held a rave at
Long Shoremans Hall.  They had only rented the hall until 2am, but they
didn't tell anyone this.  At 2:30 the police came in and shut the rave down.
The result was a fair number of intoxicated people driving off to the
backup location at the other end of town.  Getting busted is one thing,
but deliberately holding a rave that looks legitimate but that you know 
is going to get busted is both dishonest and irresponsible.  The absence
of a Rave Called Sharon in the past six months or so was a *good* thing
for the scene.  I for one am not happy to see them back.

The promoter of Sharon is not know for, how can we say, having the most
integrity.  But in "the old days" I did have a good time at a few of 
"A rave called Sharon" parties.  I must say that it is appropriate that
Sharon host Industrial Strength,  they have consistantly supported
Hardcore Techno from the beginning, even when everybody else moved into
more funky and tribal beats, sharon stuck with hardcore, because of it,
I think they lost the "older crowd" and many of the folks that attend Sharon's
Hardcore parties, tend to be on the younger side, and mostly male. The
The last Sharon party that I enjoyed was Devotion which will go down in
SF rave history (I'm not talking about the list here.) The last Sharon I
attended was about 15 months ago in Half Moon Bay, can't remember the name
but the site was pretty, had a nice laser display, complete with a skate board 
ramp, (which some guy inevitably broke his leg on), it was a fairly good party
with a pretty view from the hill but wen the sun came up, to our surprise we had
been partying in a field of manure :)

Subject: reviews: sfresort house, DNA, thought on wicked/sin ripoff...
Status: 


What is sounds like is that the promoters are working on a
  non-party-hopping model, where folks are going to just one party apiece.
  The folks at Wicked are clearly not greedy- they're the same folks who do
  the FMRs, which are free.

In fact, what happened for my group was that we were looking at the list
  (thanks for putting it together, Derek!), and were trying to decide
  on the resort house (a must), Wicked/Spundae (my pick), and Sin (my
  friend's pick).  I called up the info line on Sin and they sounded lame.
  How can they sound lame?  You probably know, so I won't broadcast it to
  the ripoff/dishonest/bonehead promoters out there...

The SFraves resort house was a real trip- thanks to resonate for throwing a
  kicking party!  Thanks to Tamara and Ethan for kickin' sets (we got there
  -real- late, and nearly missed the whole thing, which is why we only
  caught these two).  Hey, tamara- your first mix had stuff from Orbital2?
  very cool... and was that overvoice Michael Jackson, from Thriller
  (Billie Jean, right?) - if so, that was incredible!!! Best use of that
  stuff I ever heard... The proximity to Bonnie Doon is really neat-
  thoughts about doing a combo with a bigger one there (an afterhours kinda
  thing at the house?)

Anyway, we left the house at 5am, wandered around bonnie doon for a while
  (Talia and Ciamada had never seen it)... there were a few folks camping
  out, which was cool.  Fresh oranges and a vat of Peet's black currant tea
  is really appreciated, as I'm discovering.

The sun wasn't coming up for a while, so we drove up to Half Moon Bay to
  refresh, refill on the gas, and catch the sunrise.  Which was amazing.
  Just pulled the car into a deserted beachlike area, and chilled for five.

Ciamada called me on Wicked and dragged me to DNA instead, which turned out
  to be just fine- not a real thrill itself, but hopping and fairly steady,
  even in the slower hours of 7-10am... At $5, it was a win- they were kind
  about ins-and-outs, they were cool with our packs, it was loud but not
  oppressive, and they have a zillions bathrooms- a major bonus to anyone
  who's ever, say, been to (for example) Limelight in nyc... one bathroom
  set for over 1000 people.  Of course, the trick is to get on the 'list
  and get in the back, where you almost get treated like a a piece of shit.
  But I digress...

The point is that, clearly, the proprietors of DNA aren't trying to make
  their buck on getting 50 people to stay all night, but rather on getting
  ~20 new faces per hour(avg), from 9pm-2pm.  Let's see- that's 17 hours...
  $1700, enough to cover the very basics.  Then they sell drinks and
  they're covered on the DJs, etc.

This is in stark contrast to our big time partiers, who were trying for
  1000 people paying $25 once, which is a much bigger gamble.  Yes, you
  stand to make more money, but you also increase your risk greatly- there
  were over a dozen major events for New Year's, and only so many ravers to
  go around.  My point: the way to run this show is to assume people will
  party hop and charge $5-10 cover.  Then, you either explicitly charge for
  food/drinks/tshirts/nicknacks (not tap water!!!), or you get donations.
  This covers you better in the event of a disaster, since nobody will
  trash your name on the net over the admission price to a underattended
  "massive" (and you won't be any poorer than for the other case, since it
  really boils down to the same amount of money, esp. since people aren't
  dumb- the $25 party that dies will be obvious to anyone outside- there
  won't be enough cars, there won't be enough milling around outside, there
  won't be in and out traffic, etc.  - where for $5, most people I know
  won't care, and try it anyway, just because going elsewhere is too much
  of a pain.

Some examples of how to do it right:
- DNA (see above)
- Liquid Air, September(?) - outdoors, became a puny party when the bigname
  DJs were playing (was it Wicked?) elsewhere in SF.  The party was about
  size 50, with a moderate turnover.  No cover, but they brought in a huge
  box of drinks that someone had donated (really weird stuff: odwalla
  watermellon juice and carrot juice) and some blow pops.  Bob manned the
  thing with a hat, on th basis of hey- contribute + eat... no inflated
  prices, no bullshit.  I ended up throwing $5-$10 in total, and helped set up.
  (and I would have been happy to contribute more, but I'm a grad student-
  nuff said!)
- Basics Reunion, August(?) - indoors, did very nicely- thousands of
  people.  $15 cover, fairly pricey OJ and shakes (not outrageous), free
  oranges and bananas in the am if you stuck around.  A fair deal- I'm sure
  the promoters walked away fat and happy.  Probably could have been $10,
  depending on the cost of the security and the rent... but hey...

Some examples of how not to do it:
- Sin, Wicked - see below.
- FMRs (!) - they really should have a hat out.  Even though there's
  nothing there except the DJs, their equipment, and lots of vibe- it is
  clearly worth it to throw in a few bucks.  Maybe then they won't have to
  go for broke on normal Wicked events?  (there's no law about donations,
  right? this is literally just a hat...)

Btw, as an interesting sidenote-story, I should throw in the Limelight in
  nyc, a really interesting place I went to right at the end of their
  heydays... It's in a big old church they bought on 20th and 6th, smack in
  the middle of manhattan, but away from anything interesting (kinda in the
  wholesale and distributor district).  The deal: $15 cover, and no
  ins-and-outs (which sucks, but helps cut down on neighborhood complaints,
  muggings of patrons (elcome to new york), etc.).  They force people to
  wait outside and slowly let them in (unless you look cool or are female
  and attractive- good symbiotic thing, since few women I knew would want
  to be walking around 20th and 6th at those^H^H^H^H^Hany hours alone),
  which means that there's always a huge crowd of people mulling about.
  You can't see in, and there are multiple exits, so it's impossible to
  tell what the crowd is like inside.  Anyway, they routinely made money
  hand over fist, with the place completely packed, and socking people for
  $6 on drinks.  But, it was totally worth it on a fri/sat night (one of
  them is "gay night", and since I'm straight, I went elsewhere)... they
  had amazing live shows (some really weird performance art stuff as well),
  incredible music, multiple dance floors, several chill rooms, and they
  even hired freaks to staff the place, giving it this even trippier feel,
  since you had all of these extreme (but harmless) wackos wandering
  around.  If you've ever been there: the guy in the spacesuit... nuff said.

later days,
adam

I was under the impression that Halim was no longer in charge of the 
Sharons. They were an early victim in 'the crowd too-big' deal and 
decided to throw smaller events and events elsewhere (Seattle). I seem to 
remember there being some disagreement about this which ended up in Halim 
leaving, or I could just be brain dead. Anyone else know more? JMAR.

Or you could have paid $10.00 for Jazid Up at 1015 Folsom, hung out for
45 minutes to celebrate the new years, walked down to wicked parking
lot and hang out for a while and dance, then return to 1015 around  3AM
to find a truly hopping Acid Jazz/House/Funk/Disco set going on in the
tiny upstairs room overlooking Folsom. Later on (4:30-5:50AM), the main
room was going off with some good techno and a not-very-large crowd.
Follow up by attending a going-off Boogie Buffet on Saturday....

Total cost for 17 hours of entertainment -- $18.00 (B.B. was shockingly
high-priced, $8.00). 

Meanwhile, I think we got to see most of what Wicked/Spundae had to
offer by standing around in the parking lot and doing a little dancing
(afterall, a parking lot under the freeway is a parking lot no matter
which side of the fence you're on). We also got to notice plenty of bad
vibes on the part of the people that couldn't get in and were lined up
for hours inside (pushy, rude people on drugs), bad vibes on the part
of people bumrushing the show, and bad vibes on the part of surly
security that had to deal with a bunch of assholes. It really amazed me
that the people in line didn't realize that they could just as well be
dancing to  the music in the parking lot instead of pushing and cutting
in line. It was nice to see that a small number of individuals had this
idea and were carrying it out with much energy and glee.

Also, once Wicked/Spundae reached the capacity where they weren't
letting more people in, the promoters should have just pulled down the
plastic sheeting covering the fences so that all could feel like they
were "in" the party, even though some were outside. Why make the
outsiders feel any worse than they already do? Wonder if they'd have
needed so  many surly security goons had they done something like
this....

But then again, I am not a strong believer in capitalism, greed, free
enterprise, and all that crap, so what would I know? There seems to be
a vague belief in some kind of a rave ethos that runs counter to all
that, a belief fervently held by sheepish rave followers, a belief
which the promoters love to foster while they pull the wool over our
eyes and dupe us into thinking that their big-business dealings are
somehow related to "love" "vibe" and other warm/fuzzy rave-ethos
notions.

Subgenius Corollary: Pull the wool over your own eyes. Don't let
someone else do it for you.

PS: I thought of a new "house" Cambells soup commercial. It goes
like this 
	"So Good, So-oh Good, So Good, It's MM MM Good
	 So Good, So-oh Good, So Good, It's MM MM Good
	 ...
	 So Good, So-oh Good, So Good, It's MM MM Good"
(repeat ad-infinitum, much like the song with similar lyrics that I've
been hearing too much of.)

On the other hand, consider this: I've bought two pairs of MDR-V6's
(one for studio, one for my walkman/discman at work) back before they
were discontinued --  for $74.95, at Fry's Electronics in Palo Alto.
Ebers is cool, but they are a way overpriced (Compared to mail-order
rates, Fry's is overpriced too, but I like their 30 day exchange
policy).

Remember, most stores "Sale" prices cut down their obscene markup,
which is often 30-50% in the retail business. So it's not like they're
really sacrificing anything other than losing a bit of profit so they
can clear out obsolete stock (usually a win-win situation on the part of
the retailer).

The first "Rave Called Sharon" I went to was in Jan '92, in a community
center in the Mission, that used to be called The Farm back in the days
where local rock bands like the Looters and the Ophelias used to play there.
The building was not very far from a residential neighborhood, which is
probably why they stopped having rock shows there.

We arrived at about 12:30, and I remember the sound and visual production
was quite excellent, and I checked my jacket expecting a really fine
party.  The police showed up about 10 minutes later.  We spent the next
hour trying to retrieve our jackets from the coat check like everyone else.

The next couple of Sharons were held at 177 Townsend, and they were a
bit like the ToonTown's at that time, except the production was really
thin and sloppy, and the crowd was decidedly on the creepy side, so
I crossed them off my list (that was before the Longshoreman's Hall
fiasco).  I did hear many great reports about Devotion, so I guess
you can't always judge a chapter of a book by it's previous seven chapters...

Yeah, definatly look around... Gunther and I found our pair for $65 in
one of those pawnshops by the Powell cable car turnaround.  (they were
new, the shop had like 4 or 5 of them at the time.  Probably really
difficult to get now though).

It's an excellent set of headphones, highly recommended.

New Years Rave report
=====================
By John Draper

   Well,  New Years Eve wasn't one of those 4 day rave marathons I
expected,  because on those days leading up to NYE,  there just wasn't
anything happening.    I guess the promoters needed a well deserved rest.

   For me,  it was also layed back,   where I took a rest from the weekly
Thursday ritual.   I guess I'll start off by saying that the Tuesday Evening
Full Moon caper didn't come off,   based on reports that were previously
published on the netz.    There wasn't anything on Thursday that kept my
interest.   So I spent my time reading the SFR,  and Cypherpunks mail thats
been accumulating.    I discovered that the SFR folks were planning to
have a small private party up at a resort near Bonny Dune beach,  and
I talked one of my non-raver friends to join me.    This was great,  cause
he helped pay for the gas to make the 1 1/2 hour trip down there,  and
I've been trying to get him to a rave for over a year.

   We arrived at the resort about 10:30 PM,  and already about 25 to 30 
people were partying.  The "Resort" is an interesting place,   apparently
most living there were UC Santa Cruz students with some UNIX systems connected
to the Internet.   Ethan and Brycer provided the DJ setup,  and about 11:30
the live DJ'ing began.    Brycer started off with some OLD OLD disco,  mixed
in with some very non-conventional but rather entertaining stuff.   About
30 seconds from midnight,  Brycer faded down the music and the countdown to
the new year began.   It was ths usual NYE Hoots and holler type of party,
and shortly after that,  Ethen got behind the turtables,  where I got to
hear his handy work for the very first time.   I was rather impressed with
the new and refreshing music he selected.   I stayed and danced until about
1:45,  then had to head back into SF to go to 3 other raves.

SuperNova Big Bang
==================

   I knew that Spudae/Wicked would be the BEST thing going in town,  and
wanted to get there towards the end of my rave trek through town.   I dropped
Tim off at Wicked,  and headed over to SuperNova Big Bang,  and got there
about 3:30 AM.   I had expected to see over 2000 people there,  but by the time
I got there,   it was practically empty.   And they wanted $50 at the door
(Which was why I dropped Tim off at Wicked).   Luckily,  Mark Healy,  the
promoter of Big Bang got me a ticket.   I figure about 200 people were there,
mostly from the old school and I recognized a few of my friends there.   I danced
around for about 45 minutes, tripping on the Silicon Graphics displays,  which
were rather impressive,  although I doubt if I had seen everything.    The VR
setup was already taken down,  and I figured I should get over to Wicked and
meet up with my friend.    I also get word that most people that attended the
SuperNova weren't the really hard core raver folks,  or had other parties
to attend.     I got word that at about 2:30,  the place emptied drastically.

Spundae/Wicked
==============

   By the time I got back to Wicked,  about 4:15,    Jeno was behind the 
turntables pumping out sone of the most brilliant trancey stuff I've heard 
in a very long time.   The cost was a rather high $25.   But people were
still able to enjoy the music by dancing on the other side of the fence.

   Wicked was held at the DV8 lounge,  where the main dance area was out in the
parking lot under the freeway ramp.     I could hear the music all the way up 
on Folsom St as I was heading down to Natoma.    The aural experience of hearing
the music echo between the buildings was really awsome.    I can image what it
must have sounded like from someone on the freeway driving over the rave.    They
might have responded "WOW!!  Did you hear that?"  It must have freaked a few
motorists out.    On the first floor of the DV8 on the inside was another dance
area,   but I don't know who was DJ'ing at that time,  because I stayed outside
in the parking lot dancing my butt off.   It was really GREAT!  being outside
dancing where it was cool,  and I pulled out all my stops and really kicked ass
with the music,  not too concerned about getting too hot.   Eventually,  I 
had to stop (regrettably) after about an hour and half of continious dancing,
cause the energy was totally awsome.   Even the 50 degrees was too hot for me 
by that time.    It took be about 15 minutes to cool down,  I was so hot.
I think Marky MArk came on after that (Correct me if I'm wrong).   And yet more
totally awsome energy came out that super sound system that literally rocked
the freeway structure.    Ahhh!  So wonderful to be raving OUTSIDE again,  
especially with that VERY POWERFUL,  and very clean sound system.  Makes
the sound system of the End Up sound like a transistor radio in comparison.

   The people were really awsome as well,   as I got a lot of great smiles
from the people out there dancing,  and me,  looking like a crazy idiot
out there scooting around.    Most ALL of my friends were at the Wicked.
A little later,  the Boogie Buffet folks were passing out flyers,  and handed
a bunch to me,   and I distributed about a hundred of them,   looking at
each person I gave them to,  and in my usual excited way,   I would say 
"Best after party in town - Be there or Be Square",  and they would say
"Great!" I'll see you there...".   I think I was responsible for getting
at least 100 people into Boogie Buffet after Wicked ended at 9 am.   This
got me into Boogie Buffet for free.

Boogie Buffet and the End Up
============================

   This was a SPECIAL and final edition of Boogie Buffet,  cause Preston
needed a 3 month break to spend more time with his family,  but assured
me that it will start up again on 20th of March.

   When we got there,  already at least 150 people were there,  which was
really surprising.   There was the usual techno-house in the front or "Dark
room" and ths slower funkey "breakfast jazz" in the back room.    They also
opened up the upstairs area,   where the front was the chillout room (normally
not used) but this was a special occasion.    The best thing was the free food,
and very wide choice of food available and being served in the upstairs area.
Their cover was $8 instead of the usual $5.

   The place was literally packed all day long,   very hot in the front room,
so I would ocsssionally pop over to the End Up.

   At the End Up,  I net Thomas,  one of the Wicked DJ's and he informs me
that Rick Preston was behind the turntables.   Hmmm!  So THATS why music sounded
more origional than the usual limited play list they used.  Could also be the
reason why they charged $4 cover when normally it was free.   The End Up wasn't
that crowded,  and had plenty of room to really enjoy a wonderful set Preston
layed down for our ears.   If only the sound system wasn't so wimpy..  Also
the people at the End Up were the "Clubber" types,  with somewhat cockey
attitudes.

   After Preston left,   I headed back to Boogie Buffet and party'ed there
until they closed (around 7 pm).    As usual,  the music was tops,  and the
sound system was literally rattling the windows and the whole place was shaking
and rocking.    All my friends were there.

   At about 6:30 pm,  they closed down the front room,  but before they did that,
the DJ skillfully faded into some of the most awsome hard-core trance I've heard
(Which is rather rare in these parts - Guess most Calif dudes can't handle it),
and I really dig hard core and faster acid trance.   Almost everyone stopped
dancing except for two other friends of mine.    Knowing it was the last song,
I went totally crazy,  zapping around on the 180+ BPM beat.   Most others
were sitting on the sidelines shaking their heads as I was making eye contact
with them.   WOW!! What a WONDERFUL way to end a set.

   I was too jazzed up to go directly to the 80 - 90 BPM funkey jazzy stuff playing
in the back room,  and took a walk to cool down.    At about 7 pm,  Boogie Buffet
closed down,  ending a wonderful way of bringing in the new year.   And I'm hoping
that our new year will bring ever more insane raves.  Lets keep the scene alive...

Happy New Year to all you raver Dudz...

Well, what can you do? Kick people out? A Massive is exactly that. 
There's a lot of people. Period. You can't expect to show after 11 and 
walk right in. We got there at 9:30 and were in five minutes after the 
door opened. A big crowd is great, but there are things to be said for 
having a dance floor and DJ all to yourself sometimes. 

And there weren't that many goons which is why they needed the plastic. 
Try watching a couple hundred feet of fence. It ain't easy. And if 
anybody's stupid enough to try and force their way through a fence, I 
don't want to be bumpin into their drunk ass on the dance floor. The 
intoxicant of tradition on NYE (and at DV8) is alcohol like it or not.
And thankfully we had no problems (unlike some 'undergroud' events we 
went to with beer swillers bugging us).

At a massive, there are no 'insiders' or 'outsiders.' You either got in 
in time, or you didn't. If it's such a big blow to someone's ego, they 
wouldn't have had a good time inside anyway (or contributed to anyone 
else's). Glad to see that you at least knew what you were going for and 
found another way to get it (ala good 'ol Emporium alley).

Come on, I don't think anyone really believes this crap anymore anyway. 
Not even the promoters. I can't think of ten people on the same 
'groovoluvwavelengthtribalvibe' or whatever as me, much less two 
thousand. Any intimacies belong to the smaller parties. and we all know 
that. The language is just a throwback to our only recent model for our 
behavior - the sixties. And not everyone bought it then either. I take it 
as parody and go for my reasons, not the promoter's.

'Sheepish' 'duped' ? I knew how much it was. I was prepared to pay it. I 
like Wicked's music. A lot of friends I wanted to be with were going to 
be there. It was close to my house. I'd like to see Wicked continue 
throwing FMMs (or some variation thereof). And hell, I just wanted to see 
a good 'show.' I don't go to massives often, but when I do, they 
generally deliver, because I know what I'm going for. I don't whine about 
money or who's making what. If it's too much, I don't go. How can you 
have a good time if you're spending all night trying to get "your money's 
worth?" I don't feel duped and neither do any of my friends.

'vague belief?' I also remember there being some vague belief that there 
are 'two sides of a coin.' There's a balance of good and bad in 
everything. You can't have one without the other. Sorry. Massives exist 
and will continue to exist as long as people go to them. If you don't 
like them, don't go. Don't show up and complain to every security person 
in sight. You wonder why they get grumpy? There's plenty of other things 
to do and plenty of other places to go (especially on NYE). I like the 
smaller events, but sometimes a massive is just what I need. 

I'm not flaming anyone in particular. But this is a pointless arguement. 
I think we all know better. There's no comparison between massives and 
smaller parties. They're two different situations and provide different 
benefits. And as far as I'm concerned, they're both necessary, because 
everyone has different tastes. The 'old school/newbie' conflict is 
getting as bad as it was in the club scene we were all so disgusted with. 
Everyone can rave, and everyone should have a place for it. Live and let 
live. 

We have to get over this and get on with 1994. I count myself lucky to be 
in one of the biggest and most varied scenes on the planet. We've got a 
full pot-luck buffet. If you don't like one of the dishes, eat something 
else, or cook your own and share. But don't complain just because *you* 
don't like a particular meal. Someone else might. Praise what you do like 
and you just may get a second helping.

Hey don't be hoggin' the SLACK, man.

Status: 

The volume of mail lately has been outstanding, and trying to contribute
anything these days is quite an effort if I am to absorb everything that 
goes by this list;  either that, or I am working too hard unable to spend 
more time on mail.

Anyhow, I have noticed the best and worst lists for '93 and have been 
surprised to see very little mention of DJ Simon in any of them.  I am
curious by this and would like to hear what your thoughts of him & his
abilities are.

I have been focused on his music for the past year and have seen quite 
remarkable talent from this guy.  I particularly like his style;  rarely
does his records skip and pop, rarely are his mixes awkward, and rare
are his bad days.  He can move a crowd around the way he wants, lifting 
you high enough 'til you're about to explode, then bring you right back 
to earth when the time is right.  Sorta like a magikal disney ride.
(I get turned off quickly when DJs play tunes that go fast-slow-fast-slow
not letting you get into any kind of comfortable pace.  Sound Factory 
Djs have done thisin the past that irritate the crap out of me, and 
haven't been there since Wicked was there)  That's another point from me 
that Simon doesn't do that.

His latest stuff, as evident in his newly released tape, shows quite a 
remarkable change in a direction towards trancey/house.  I thought he was
incredible at the Wicked party Fri. nite and rocked DNA big time Sat. noon.

Keep in mind that he's not really part of the Wicked Quartet that have
always been in the limelight; his merit is earned *heavy* with the 
successful weekly parties that have kept the loyal following as they 
have (AfterLife, Together, Spundae, monthly Come/Unities, and I'm sure 
plenty more I have not attended, or forgotten).  

So, what do you think?  Doesn't he deserve more credit?

it was AMAZEMATIZING (or something like that). 
Really a great and varied group of DJ's. The music set off all the lights 
in my (and seemingly others) heads, no enhancement required. 
No light show, just a little room packing with a together, happy, hopping 
crowd set off by the great music. Getting there about 1:00, the sets really
breathed right through till 6:00. The music changed so much throughout the
night, that the urge to check out the other (probably great too) shows did
not arise. This stuff can really knit a crowd together.

It's based on work pioneered by Karl Sims, and uses evolving LISP

including more strobes than I've seen anywhere since 1015 Folsom and a
projection TV, random conversational ambushes by people wearing Biohazard
stickers, and the type of friendly crowd that only shows at a house party
where everyone already knows someone else there so you can leave your coat
in a corner and not worry about it.

Then my brain melted.  Ethan threw down the sickest acid trance I've heard
since the rediscovery of the 303 -- two-minute long parameter sweeps that
drill into my spinal cord somewhere around the lower chakra and burrow 
their way through my medulla to the brain lobe responsible for "Happy Feet."
I shuffled and bounced my way over the Plain of Endurance to the Land of
Endorphin Trance, where I set up camp until sometime during Tamara's (?)
set.  (I remember names poorly: forgive me if they're wrong.)  Anyway, I
bounced through some of her hard funk at the beginning, and finally took
a much-needed water break -- but had to come back for some more trance.
Whoo.

Well, then the music stopped around false dawn, and it was time tfor a 
much-needed crash break for several hours, broken by the cleanup crew
popping balloons sometime around 11.  I grogged around for a while,
cooked some pasta for the ravening hordes (including myself), showered,
and roared off into the noon silence of the hills.

Major props to resonate, Bryce, Ethan, Tamara, and anyone else who helped
pull this off.  Anyone who complains about the scene being dead but doesn't
support parties like this with Happy Feet (tm) and ducats in the expense
jar deserves the lonely ride home in early morning drizzle after a 
vibeless bass and wallet pounding that they have a very good chance of
getting from massives from here on out if people's NYEve reports are
any indication.

I might have to actually get off my ass and throw down a house party if
it'll go even half this off.  My house isn't quite as big, but I don't know
nearly as many people, so these things balance out.

i've never been impressed by him although my roommate jeff said he
once heard him go off at Spundae in amazing fashion.  after that, jeff
and i went to a different gig (4th of July Gathering) where Simon was

indoors/outdoors, hot/chill and no attitude.
	Tho i must admit that the underground @ aircraft Tire Co. was the
best party in the city, listening to Buck's best, for those lucky secret
initiates who knew the hidden password.  (Elitism backwards is MSITILE!)
	I admit to getting 3.2 hours sleep before appearing bright-eyed at
Preston's last throw for the season.  Maybe that helped me & Tanya fly til
the end.  Dancin for every soul's joy in the coming year.  Thanks Preston.

Simon has always been one of my favorite DJs, up there with Jon Williams
and Dutch.  His sets vary each time you hear him (unlike Jeno or Garth) and
his music is always pumping and full of energy.  I have heard mediocre sets
from him, but they were always when he was opening a gig.  His sets at
the first massive Unity and his on NYE were his best.

I stayed away from all parties on New Years Eve.  I actually stayed 
at home most of the night.  That was fine by 
me.  I woke up instead at 3:30 am and got ready to go to San Francisco.  
We hit the End Up at 6:30 or so.  We hung out there until about 8 
am.  We walked over to BB for about an hour.  There wasn't too many 
people there at the time and there was a plastic sheet over the sun 
room.  We stayed there till about 8:45 or so.  I didn't understand 
at first why BB was $8.00.  I didn't really care because I didn't 
have to pay but I was just curious.  Back to the End Up by 10.  I 
spent most of the day there and had a really good time.  I didn't 
see most of the usual ravers that I have seen on Saturdays.  I did 
see some interesting people though and had a really good time talking 
with people and listening to music.  I didn't see any of the people 
that someone else described as having attitudes.  I did go back to 
BB for a few minutes to see some friends.  There I did see a lot 
of people with attitudes laying around in the sun room "posing and 
gawking"  I felt very uncomfortable there and left.  It was a very 
strange attitude prevailing there.  I talked with a friend who stayed 
longer and she described how some man came over to her when she was 
sitting alone in the dark room and actually tried to pick her up!!?? 
Yuck!!  I did go back to BB later when a friend I saw at End Up told 
me that the reason BB was 8 dollars was because of the food upstairs.  
I didn't even know.  Of course I had to journey back over there to 
check it out. I did not expect to see what I saw.  I was expecting 
maybe just fresh fruit, muffins, and juice.  What was there was even 
better.  There were rice and beans, corn fritters, little rolls that 
tasted like mini pizza rolls, and a couple of other dishes.  The 
food was there all day and it was always hot.  It was worth the trip 
back over there, though I didn't go downstairs, but to leave.  
I had a really good time overall especially since the weather was 
so warm and I saw so many people that I knew.  For me it was worth 
it to stay at home New Year's Eve. 


Happy New Year all!!

I look forward to a better year in 94'.

after much waffling we headed out to Jazzid Up at 1015 Folsom around 1
AM.  (we were hoping to miss the midnight crunch.)

door guy was handing out the flyer for the party which entitled you to
half price.  nice deal, instant coupon.

so we get in for $10, and are faced with a room full of loud drunks in
suits picking up sloshed women in pumps.  eeek!  after a quick tour of
the club (everywhere else equally evil looking) we found the Jazzid Up
room upstairs in the back.  a DJ named (i think) Jay was spinning
rap instrumentals, which made me very happy... he ended with cypress
hill at which point the next DJ (whose name I didn't catch) took over.
he was more into that soul/jazz-not-jazz/dorado groove thang that
doesn't really thrill me so i decided to explore the rest of the club.
the big dance room was starting to clear since alcohol was no longer
being dispensed.  in fact, it was amazing (to me) at how fast the
place emptied.  but the DJ out there started to really get things
moving and i was into it.  i would have been more into it except one
of the people i was with was not quite healthy and the smoke/fog
machine was giving her a lot of trouble.

and then we found that the jazz room was so packed that they weren't
letting people in until other people came out.  so this got to be
quite a hassle, especially as others we had come with were still
trapped in there.

eventually our group was reunited and we decided to take a walk down
to Wicked/Spundae to see what was going on.  music sounded good
outside but the line was insane (at 3 AM!) and $25 just didn't seem
like a worthwhile investment.  one of our number was standing near a
group who decided to break through the fence, so she dove in with them
but was promptly grabbed by four burly guards and unceremoniously
ejected.  at least she provided a distraction so the other guys made
it through OK.

we hung around for a while, again waffling about whether to get in
line, when another group decided to make a break through the fence.
this time the security guys were on the case and one of them landed
one of the trespassers with a nasty flying tackle that unnerved me
greatly.

so at this point we all marched back to 1015 Folsom.  some of the
party stayed there to dance some more, but i and a few others returned
to home base, intending to grab some sleep (or at least rest) until
boogie buffet.

we got up and headed back to BB around 11 and it was pretty cool, but
i never really thought it was anything particularly special and this
time was no exception.  i did get to hang out with a few friends who i
haven't seen in ages, so that made it at least partly worthwhile.

unfortunately, the first i heard about the free food was when i read
it in vivianm's posting 10 minutes ago.  damn damn damn, cos i was
*really* hungry too.  in fact, hunger forced me to hit the road around
2 PM.  so i grabbed a new years tostada and went home for another nap.

and that's it.  happy new years and a great 94 to all of you.

Big Thanks to resonate for inviting us down there for what was a really
cool scene. Great house, thumping sound system, free blow pops, good
friends, mucho smiles; tonite let it be Lowenbrau ;-)

Meme did serious damage with his History of Dance Music set, the only
drawback to which was these three Goth women trying to rip my head off
during my set insisting that *I* play more "retro" -- they either thought I
was Meme or couldn't tell the difference |-) At one point one of them stood
on the dancefloor screaming: We want more retro, this techno sucks  |-) 
Luckily, Phred was there to put a quick cork in her; thanks Phred ;)

Tamara wrapped things up with a great play through her newest material all
of which I loved  :)

Battled fog and hallucinations back to the city arriving just in time to
pass out, not to reappear til later that evening.

happy new year all!

okay.. $25 or $20 is a ridiculous price
yes it was a parking lot under a highway overpass
(personally _I_ thought that was cool and so did most of the

there was also 3 other room with 2 dance floors and one chill out room
where the floor was totally covered in people lyign down
on the goround on top of each other and just great music playing along
which i enjoyed

the music i heard was wonderful
at points i was so seriously tranced out that i think
i was on the verge of having an oobe or something like that
it was REALLY amazing

BUT
i think that there needed to be a hell of a lot more communication
with the people in line about why they were waiting in line
and if they even had to cuz, that was a joke

and if things had been run better in that regard, i highly
doubt the fence thing would have happened
and people wouldnt have been running along the roofs and stuff

but i still had fun
and i danced all the way back to my friends place in the western addition
and wandered around for awhile enjoying the wondeful view
when the party ended at 9

Well, NYE started early with lot's 'o work and loose endz to tie up as I was
involved in setting up ReSoLuTioN as well as organizing the FreeVibe
Afterparty. Ran around and hung out with my friend Chariti, Donovan and my
nephew Chris and his friend Eric.  We got to ReSoLuTioN around 10:30.  The
main room was not open yet when we arrived.   Everyone was ushered into the
large ambient room which was wonderfully filled with visuals by Seer Media
of Seattle.  The main room was finally opened about 11:45 and count down
commenced, progressed and EXPLODED into THE best party in Seattle this past
year!!!  All of the DJ's sets were superb.  The visuals by Synergy and Seer
were fantastic.  The people were just absolutely eXcited and Vibed out. 
Seattle's people are really starting to catch on to what the vibe is about
and it was quite evident at the party.

At 5:30am I had to leave to setup for the FreeVibe Afterparty which was
held at the Velvet Elvis lounge in downtown Seattle.  This was a free party
where everyone in the community pitched in time, money, energy and talent
for the love of the Vibe!  The after party went off unbelievably smoothly
and well.  Everything just fell into place and the second vibe explosion of
the new year happened.  I would like to thank everyone who partycipated!

1!!!

The party was a GREAT success.  Everything seemed to just fall into place
and it all happened very smoothly.  I'll leave the review of the party to
someone else.

The owners of the space were so impressed with the turn out that they have
asked us to do a weekly or bi-monthly party there.  Soooo.... Stay tuned
for the grand opening of the CHOC-LIT FACTORY @The Velvet Elvis!!!  New
adventures in the House of Funk, Trance and Tribal.  The tentative opening

I've been reading the posts on the list for the last few weeks, and one 
that struck me as odd was the 'party-hopping' that a lot of you seem to 
do.  Out here on the East Coast, it's generally, you go to one 
rave/event, stay there the whole night, and if you're up to it, shoot 
over to the after-hours.

Any particular reason this occurs?

i would assume that it largely has to do with much closer parties
considering the fact that in the South of Market area of SF
ther were like 5 or 6 parties i knew of, it makes it easy
to go to a bunch.. esp. if you only like one dj at each
and they are all on at consecutive times
not that youre usually that lucky, but still

in LA, if the clubs are close enough i think similar stuff happens

dunno how close things are on the east coast...

also, going to an 'event/rave' is a LOT different than stopping
by a club

All in all, the locals seemed anywhere from disinterested to mildly annoyed
by the whole thing, although I gather the residents of the place were pretty
pumped.  

The weather was great -- I walked up the road a bit during Tamara's set and

Yup. You can say that again!! It was great meeting all these cool people 
at the Resort.. Thanks to resonate aka gristle(hehehee) for talking the 
resort people in to having sfravers come down there.. The place was 
pumping.:)

As for Bryce's set, I thought it was great..  I loved the 45's.:). And it 
was soooo funny that he even played Y-M-C-A by the Village People. I am 
surprised he didnt whip out more disco:). 
Ethan's set was WICKED.. I loved the tracks he played.. (prob. cuz I 
already knew  most of the tracks.:))
And I am glad Tam brought her record bag and spun as well. I was afraid 
she was gonna go to sleep on the couch or something because we werent 
sure if she was playing or not, but I am glad she did.. great new tracks, 
tam..:) 

I never made it to Boogie Buffet.. I was way too tired.. I did head over 
to the End Up later that afternoon to hear Derrick Carter spin a great 
deep house set, but I guess the weekend fatigue really got to me by then 
because I was in and out of it:). As for Mushroom Acid Jazz on Mondays, I 
really like the space.. the place really didnt  get kickin' til 12 or 
12:30 or so.. it was packed in the back dance floor. The music was 
cool... they even played Barry White!:). It was great seeing some old 
faces at the jazz club, Bob Jesse, Graham, Derek, etc. I didnt expect to 
see that many sfravers there. BTW, does anyone know when the Charlie 
Hunter Trio is playing next? I really would like to go see them..

Lee and I decided to forego the mega-attended, big $ parties this year and
hold out for Boogie Buffet.  We most definitly made the right choice.
NY Day's BB is surely going to go down as one of my best parties for 1994.
So many familiar faces and faces that became familiar by the end of the
evening...lots of spontaneous hugging, laughing, and great toys being passed
around (lets hear it for Toys R Us).  Free food, water, ins and outs and no
heavy handed security.

I have always been disappointed with the dark room (i.e., murky sound, dark
and smokey), but i still spent some time dancing to Spun.  The light room was
absolutely amazing -- it reminded me of a cross between Come Unity and Boogie
Buffet; 

Being at a party at dusk was strange and wonderful, and then around 6:00
or so they started an intelebeam show that was pretty psychedelic and 
not overdone or aimed at anyone's eyes in the crowd.  The party ended around 
7:30 and when the lights went on, everyone's faces were so bright and 
beautiful.  I believe that BB was probably the happiest place on Earth and 
if this is any indication for the rest of the year -- it is going
to be GREAT!!

HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY!

Wired is having its one year Anniversary Celebration on January 5...

Martin is helping presenting it, and the DJs are Josh, Mark Farina,
and "Evil" Eddie Richards.  It starts at 9:30 and goes until 2:00 or so,
so it's a good preparty for Come/Unity.  Best of all it's FREE. 

It's gonna be in an unused/new warehouse in San Francisco, and it's
18 and up.  Call 415-978-0878 or the Basics line 905-9629 for more info.

Should be a good time.  

(oh, btw--Wicked: too cold, Simon was the best, I really liked Markie's
set, I thought Jeno and Garth's sets were lacking--especially Garth's,
it was like listening to his past three tapes....new records are needed...)


take care...

	I have a superstition about New Years, I like to believe that
	what ever I'm doing when the year changes will be what I'm doing
	for the rest of the year, in the least, what I'm doing that night
	will color the events of the next year.  Last year many of us
	(8000 or so) were crammed into a large structure in vallejo
	with freezing rain outside and pools of water on the floor inside.
	This year there were dozens of parties, I went to Spundae/WICKED
	which I thought was pretty good but then if I had to pay $25,
	I don't know if I would have thought that.  All in all I must say
	that the entire Spundae/WICKED experience, including a live performance
	by DubTribe (this alone made it worth the admission price) was pretty
	trippy.  The Stelth Bomber dropped it's load here so attitude 
	eventually receeded to a minimum. I've made some observations about
	the WICKED posse that I would like to share:

	1) These folks are really artist at constructing parties, they are
	very good at creating the athmosphere that IS WICKED from a very
	few props.  Trish did an excellent job on the chill-out room with
	just 1 1/2 hours left to her before opening time, because someone
	who was suppose to handle it didn't.  From what I gather from the post,
	everyone seemed to really like it.

	2) They are really space cadets, what I mean by this is that they
	are really creative, give them "space" and they will fill it with
	the most wonderful things, but they are not real good on the nuts and
	bolts logistics of everyday life.  They have been throwing parties
	for almost 10 years so many of the things are instictual at this point.

	3) There goal is to "infect" as many people as possible with the
	psychedelic-vibe that is available at their parties.  (These are
	my OWN interpretations, not necessarily the very words of any 
	specific members.

	4) All in all one of the biggest attractions to WICKED asside from
	the music is the "crowd" that tends to follow them around.  The best
	way I could describe it is as a bunch of pirates :)  Maybe
	jsl can elaborate a little more :)

	Anyway I think `94 will be an all around  good year for the Scene
	at large, let's hope so, if we all focus our energies toward
	this goal instead of complaining, then it can really turn out
	the way we want it.

I don't think that the dress is the problem. It's the lack of vibe,
standing around, bad attitude, etc. that people don't like. There's
just a correlation between the gangstas and this sort of
happiness-sucking.

I certainly wouldn't try and tell anyone how to behave at a rave. But
I'd much rather go to one where people are happy and dancing than one
where the object seems to be to stand around and look the coolest.

Two Wicked stories:

My friend Steve arrived around 2:00 tottaly broke and danced by the door for
an hour, looking and vibing like he was broke and realy wanted to get in.
At about 3:00 a kind door person nodded to him and looked towards the entrance
to say "go on in".  Kindness.

An "aquaintance" of mine was standing by the door trying to decide what to do
after finding out the party was $25 when some guy hands him a ticket and asks:
"Are there ins and outs?"  My aquaintance says:  "No, no ins and outs" and 
walks away with a free ticket in his hands as the unsuspecting party-goer
tries to walk through the door and is surprised and tries to explain when the
door person asks where his ticket is.  Trickery.

As am I.  There is entirely too much pretentious bullshit being slung
around these days.  I don't slag it too hard, though, because it is
often a sincere if muddled attempt at breaking away from the
life-breaking messianic religions.  Plus, it's fun, and one person's
pretentious bullshit is another's liberation.  The genre of bullshit I
hate the most is ironic "seen-it-all" bullshit, which despite being no
fun at all has become the foundation of industrial, goth, punk, and
generic consumer sell-out culture.  The Calvinist work/suffering ethic
often has the most power over those who cosmetically deny it the most.

We are talking about two different concepts (religion, spirituality)
and a modifier (stupid).

Spirituality is an individual's subjective experience of "love",
"god", "universal one-ness", "karma", or any other state of being that
cannot be communicated by logic.

Religion refers to organizations which are, in truth, dedicated to the
control and exploitation of others, though they purport to dedicate
themselves to the spread of spirituality.  (Government is a similar
organization which purports to protect individual rights, but that's
for another essay.)

Stupid can describe both, but is more aptly applied to the more
blatantly fascist forms of religion, e.g. Catholicism, Islam.  I can
already hear the apologists yelling "These aren't the _true_ teachings
of the Bible or Quran, these are extremists" -- but you cannot
separate the two.  Intentions matter not a whit.  Look at what Stalin
did with Communism, which as written is the ultimate
anarcho-syndicalist utopian plan.

By this measure, Taoism isn't a religion, and the Church of the
Sub-Genius is the only honest religious organization on Earth.  Both
make a lot of sense to me, as do any pagan/indigenous celebrations
that bond with the land, seasons, or general joy of life.  I am
sometimes radically spiritual, but not religious, and recognize that
spirituality is the ultimate subjective experience and cannot be
communicated by other than direct involvement.  Just try to explain,
in words that stick to someone who has no clue, why raves are any
different than any random club night of loud dance music.  Try and
explain "trance", or "the vibe".  All you can do is grin dangerously
and say "It's cool, come try it."

Works for me, anyway.

Peace, love, and casuistry-

Subject: Warning: International Internet Association

A company calling itself the International Internet Association, and billing
itself as "the largest non-profit provider of free Internet access in the
world" has started advertizing in the Washington, D.C. area, and offering free
Internet accounts to individuals who will FAX them, among other things, a
credit card number.  As an active member of the Member Council of the National
Capital Area Public Access Network (CapAccess), I wanted to find more about
this organization that supposedly has offices NOT THREE BLOCKS FROM CAPACCESS.
Here's the result of my search for the IIA.

1.  Their address, listed as "Suite 852 - 202 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W. Washington
D.C. 20006", is actually a post office box at Mailboxes, Etc.

2.  The company lists no incorporation, trademark or service-mark licenses.

3.  They claim your E-mail address would be <userid>@iia.org.  However:
      a.  No iia.org is listed in the hq.af.mil hosts table
      b.  No iia.org is listed in the acq.osd.mil hosts table
      c.  No iia.org is listed is the INTERNIC 'whois' database
      d.  No iia.org is listed using the INTERNIC 'netfind' Internet lookup
In other words, IIA.ORG does NOT, at this time, exist.

4.  Although they apologize profusely in the application, they state that
"Without receiving a credit card number, the IIA _cannot_ process an account."

5.  Although I have left a message on their voice-mail system, I have received
no response from them.  (they also apologize in the voice mail that, due to
demand, they are operating at a 3-week backlog for applications.)

I cannot judge an organization in advance.  However, I do think it highly
suspicious that, to use their propaganda, "The International Internet
Association is able to make this service available through generous private
donations, and the extraordinary dedication of its membership."  I can say that
I am not convinced this organization exists, and highly discourage any Internet
user from sending information until you make certain that the IIA is real.

1) Everyone drives to things out here, because BART/Caltrain/etc. mostly
  close after midnight, including weekends... you're tellin' me- I'm also
  from nyc, and I know it's bs, but hey...

2) Alcohol isn't part of the picture, so it's a lot easier to work a dd
  into the game plan.

3) dunno about the east coast, but things seem to be cheaper here (sometimes
  free, even) - so it's a lot easier to 'hop.

4) as another post pointed out, things are relatively close together
  (although the two big spots I find myself are SOMA and Santa Cruz (can
  you say "Bonnie Doon" and neighborhood).  Driving, it's about an hour or so.
  But definitely worth it for the city/country/seashore/mountains contrast.

peace on,
adam

Status: 

Greetings friends,

Well the house party on January 15 is shaping up nicely. Recent good news
is that it will take place in the black room(s) of the blue cube
(resonate's house). And I'm here to tell you, if ever there was a room for
spinning and dancing to acid house -- this is it. Really exceptional. Many
of you have rsvpd plus friends (a dozen in one case) so I think we will
actually attain the famed critical mass on this one.

To facilitate our friends actually finding the party, I have prepared an
informational handout (mini-flier) containing the date, info line, etc. For
those of you that have rsvpd, are spinning, or are now interested,  please
find me at the Wired party tonite, YSH tomorrow, or gimme a jingle so I can
get some to you. Please give them to your, our friends.

Boy am I excited, this is really gonna be fun :)
see ya
