Chances are Scott and Robbie Hardkiss will be coming to the picnic
tomorrow, and they asked *me* if they could spin a while (gee, let me
think about this a second...  ;^)

It also looks like Ken and Harry Who (Gathering and Destiny) and Kevin
B (co-founder of Zanzibar) will be there.

Hope you will, too!

hi y'all!
here's an idea. we could take the rave TO THE STREETS of SF. rev./rabi
cecil williams of glide memorial is calling for a march from glide on
sat. at 11 am. that's at ellis & taylor. if we can figure  way to have
music, we can march/walk/dance to rave muzak and get off the cop/victim
trip and onto the rave trip, charging   all with positive energy.

I'd guess that Rozalla would be cancelled, since there's another curfew
in SF tonight.  Equinox would be questionable; they still have a message
(I just called...it said to meet at 775 Grove (at Webster) at 10 pm tomorrow)
I wouldn't count on the violence subsiding by tomorrow, but if they're
planning to hold Equinox somewhere out of the way, I guess it could
still go on.

I don't know about the raves going on this weekend, but last night Freesia was
canceled.  (Of course, the recording was never changed -- I had to drive by the
place to check it out.)  I ended up going to Terriculous, which was a lot of
fun despite the low turnout.  It appears that only the hard-core ravers wanted
to venture out last night, so I was glad I went.  

Only half of the police who noticed me gave me dirty looks.  :-)

Share and enjoy,

Tim

P.S.  Tonight I think I'm going to avoid the city and try out Colossus's south
bay endeavor.  Colossus is one of the big gay clubs in San Francisco (Saturdays
at 1015 Folsom) and tonight they're having a party at One Step Beyond in Santa
Clara.  Although they use the word "rave" on the flyer, I doubt it will be very
rave-like.  But the music will be good...

In LA they have cancelled all the raves and
clubs and basically everything

but you may be underground and so the cops dont know to stop you
but having a bunch of people at a rave shot ro hurt or killed
is not good PR and so i know that they are cancelled down here

well not everywhere down here, cuz i live in Orange County
which means everyone is just going out and buying guns
for when 'those types' come down here next

Seems to me the best thing ravers can do, as ravers, is to continue to make
harmony and promote tolerance and openness to everyone. We all have our
politica
l lives as well, of course.  And what we do there follows that star of our
individual consciences.  But rave music, like the best of 60s rock, is meant to
affirm and bring together. To let it get tangled up in the crosswebs of hate
and frustration would be a mistake. To let raves be what they are is to join
the forces of healing.
  To rave is to affirm.

Subject: Thursday night curfew
Status: R


Last night, 2 of the three raves going on were cancelled.  The only
one left was Terriculous Imagination at the Endup which had the right
setup and everything.   The DJjs were playing music that was fierce,
the interactive video was fun to see how one's movements
translated to the video and Frank Genius was creating some amazing
live techno right in front of me.  I loved his sets and his songs really
hit the right note because I love house that have "rests" in a song
where you can only hear the piano or other ambient lull.    

The atmosphere was really good.  It's just too bad that more ravers
didn't venture out and become part of the "safety zone" within the
confines of the curfew.  It was kind of like a twilight zone because
all businesses including gas stations that I drove by south of Market
last night were closed.  Motorcycle cops were parading down the street
in convoys of 6 or 7 (not stopping for red traffic lights) about every
half hour or so, I think.  Outside some ravers who decided to use the
phone in the unlit Shell gas station opposite the Endup got harrassed
and scared by the police.  BUT INSIDE, the music was going on and it
felt like a safety zone from the harshness outside (mostly due to cops).

If only more ravers had not sat in front of their TVs watching the
news and had come down instead, it would have been really on fire. 
Of course, I'm not endorsing breaking the curfew.  I'm just saying I
did and I was glad that I did. :-)  I think Terricolous Imagination is
coming back some time in the next month or two.

happy raving

I wonder what TV viewers in the rest of this world think of the
American Justice system.  In their news reports, first they see a
video clipping of a man being beaten by cops in the US, then they hear
that these cops are declared innocent, and then they see news reports
of massive riots, fires, and dozens dead.  I wonder if they are
shaking their heads.  The American legal/justice system: what a gem?!?
I hope no other country in this world models their justice system on
the one in this country.

Subject: Equinox and curfewsX
Status: R

As of 4pm the equinox message still refered to a map point at 775 Grove 
at Webster in S.F.  The curfew may not be an issue, esp. if like last
time the event itself isn't in S.F.  Our f*cking mayor got on the
radio a 1pm today to say that "good citizens could go about their business
but anybody suspicious risks arrest".  Sounds like life in a police
state, doesn't it?  The "good" (which ehtnic groups could he possibly
have meant by that) people have nothing to fear.

When they came for the communists, I didn't do anything 'cause I wasn't a 
communist.

When they camefor the Union emebers, I didn't do anything 'cuase I wasnt' a
union member.

When they came for the gays, I didn't ...

You get the picture.  On the other hand, the cops may be to busy to bust
a bunch of people dancing in a warehouse.  It's almost an insult to think
that ravers are not perceived at a threat to the police state.

What can we do to change that, constructively?

See evryone tomorrow.

parking my new bike on the sidewalk around there.  

So anyway, thanks for the review.  Now I know that I missed a good time.
BTW, bummed I can't make the picnic (have to work) cuz I still haven't
met any of yall yet; I tend to lay low.

So if there's anymore interactive video around (that anyone's aware or)

	However, if anyone else is in the same predicament as we are and are

My friends and I are having a sympathy party here at our place.  You 
are welcome to drop in.  We should start up around nine.  All are welcome.
We'll have music, lights, and the works.  Don't stay home bored!
	(I'd rather be at the picnic, but I will try to come
up with a way to forget that as the night surges on into morning).
	we did this once before with quite a turnout--Surge II--her

Well, It was great to see everyone at the picnic. jenos I feel sorry
for your friends if they were afraid to venture into the Bay area
for fear of violence.  While it is true that there are areas in just
about any city that one should not venture into unaware or if you don't
look like you "belong".  The Bay Area is NOT LA and no-one is going to
beat you up here except maybe the Police, but thats another matter.

BTW, I think its also very interesting that when I look at the
6 o'clock new, ans see all of the looting in SF going on, they only
show People of Color doing the looting when I know for a fact,
eyewitnessed, that AT LEASE 50% of the people breaking windows and such
were white.  Makes me just wonder sometime.

Anyway The PICNIC was great, we have to do that again.  Except next time 
it MUST go on longer!!

i was bummed to miss the ravenick.  (sounds like a place to dance on a 
soviet sattelite)  have another.

cruz and ucsc did a little in protest... that night about midnighht a crowd
started at oakes (malcolm x college) gatherng people at the other 7 colleges.
every building we passed had the fire alarms pulled and sometimes 
subseqwuently
short-circuited.  this continued at many a college thru the night, even 
though the mob was downtown.  before heading off campus, we (about 600)
wnadered campus, ripping out stop signs, breaking streetlikgts,
spraypainting, etc.  it's funny, here, and in town, when the students go 
out to protest/fuck shit up the cops just race ahead of the crowd and stop
traffic for us.  never arrests.   

anyway, the mob headed downtown and thrashed the police station.  we
busted the glass doors and threw bricks thru their windows.  slogans
and crossed-out swastikas were spray painted all over the building, and
a flag was burned on the sign in front.  again, the cops just stood by.
we even ripped some of the security bars off their windows.

so we left city hall and went to the courthouse to break more windows.
unfortunately, the sherrifs kept us from actually getting into the courthouse.
it would have been /great/ to get in there and thrash stuff.

it's really hard to riot at ucsc.  they (reagan) designed it that way.
it took an hour to walk en masse to the police station, and 45 minutes 
to walk thru all eight colleges.

Status: R

I loved it, even though it got closed down early.  Neat meeting point,
good warehouse (sound reverberated quite well!), heat&humidity made it
comfortable, no alcohol (my first rave where no alcohol was served --
this had a profound effect on how the participants participated -- it
was great!)  The cops came in sometime in the night and closed it
about half way through -- perhaps they had ligitimate concerns about
fire safety codes, but seriously there was very little to burn and two
big gates to run out of in case of danger.  Plus, the DJ was right
next to the only wooden wall -- fast notification!  But alas we were
all referred to Townsend, for half price ($5).  (btw equinox was $10)

I also loved Care*Free right afterwards.  Really good crowd, great DJs
-- for me anyway.

Hope to see you all again soon!

	It was great! The sound system sounded better than I thought it would,
helped by the fact that we had great DJ's working the tables. There was more 
than enough food, and someone had the incredible foresight to bring colored
pens and stickers to customize the buttons with. All in all a very warm and
friendly event, and it was terrific to finally put faces together with all 
these e-mail addresses. 

	So do we want to hold another one of these, in a month or so? If we
do, I won't be able to arrange it, since I'll be out of town from May 23rd
until the end of June. If someone wants to volunteer to be the organizer,
by all means make yourself heard. It's really not that much trouble, just a
little nerve-wracking.... GG Park sounds like a great place to hold it. I
don't know the park that well, so I can't help in the location decision, or
where would be ideal for the sound system. All I know is, if you need a permit
look into it early, so we can make sure we have it and that the place is
reserved. Also, we might want to think about inviting other people to attend - 
people we know love the music and are friendly enough to want to meet others.
It would be interesting to see if we could get 100+ people and still maintain
the atmosphere...

	Also, many people who contributed money to help pay for the reservation
and permit asked me to tell the list how much I lost if I didn't break even.
I wasn't forceful at all in collecting the money, but I think it would be 
unfair to those who did help out to not ask everyone to pay. People gave me $76
out of the $130 it cost for the site. If you went and enjoyed it, and either
forgot to pay or didn't know who to pay, you could send me $2 or so in the 
mail. I'll post my address at the bottom of this letter. I feel like Jerry
Falwell or Jimmy Bakker.....

	Finally, I have some bad news to report. SFRaves will have to move
soon, by the end of the month, because my sysadmin-friend lost his job
(actually, the machine's being moved to a different department, with their 
own computer staff), and I'm in the process of looking for a new machine here
on campus. The OCF, a free student-run cluster of Apollos, has offered to
distribute the list over the summer, so as soon as I transfer some files and
am ready, I'll send let the list know. Over the summer I should be able to
set the list up at either soda or garnet, so I'll let you know. If worst
comes to worst, I'm willing to let someone on the list assume control, and
set it up at their machine. I really like being the list admin, so I
would really prefer to find a machine here I can use... like I said, I'll
keep y'all posted.

	Cheers, and thanx for the great picnic!

 But after describing all of the above, Foetus has the gall to say -

 Chicago cops on speed, bashing people's heads in, is what I would think
of when someone told me that the police/establishment made it "hard to
riot". Did you want the cops to hand out refreshments too? ( You should have
tried to take their doughnuts away - then you would have seen some shit fly! )

> it took an hour to walk en masse to the police station, and 45 minutes 
> to walk thru all eight colleges.

 Oh, I see, you wanted the cops to give you folks a lift to your next
"protest" site! :-) 

 ----- Later on ... -----

 After thinking about that "hard to riot at ucsc" line, maybe Foetus is
making a criticism of the "Reagan generation" presently attending UCSC.
 Maybe Foetus will clarify this point ...

 ************************************************************

 I was only able to make it to the last 1.5 hour of the first ever sfraves
picnic. Still, I had a good time. It was strange to dance on the uneven
forest floor. If you tried to do anything that involved only one foot on
the ground, it was easy to lose your balance. It made it hard to do spins.

 Thanks to the good DJs that risked the life of their vinyl to the cloud
of dust we raised.

 Neat light toys, brought by **** ( I don't remember her name, the gal
from WELL w/ 2 kids ). Kaleidoscopes of all kinds. And who brought the
blow-strobe mask? I copied the address from the inside of the mask:

         "Send $14.95 to:  Alpha Odysseys
                           PO Box 17997
                           Boulder, CO 80308

 Before I send $14.95 to these guys, I was wondering if this thing is still
available locally? Where have people found them?

 Definitely send Brian $$$ for the picnic, if you've not done so ( like me -
there was this nagging thought at the back of my mind, all the time I was 
at the picnic ...).

 Hopefully, by the time of the next sfrave picnic, I'll have completed a
working model of a "stereo" LED strobe goggle I've been designing. It's
inspired by an experience I had a few months ago. I was at a "cyber" event
in Santa Cruz, and in one of the rooms, they had put out a bunch of hand-
held LED flasher units. I took one in each hand, and held them up against
my closed eyelids. Having different frequencies going to each eye is quite
different from having the same frequency - "stereo" vs "mono". If I ever
get this goggle made, I'd like to find out what other people experience
when they use it!

Hmm, looks like you're heading towards mind machine country.  I have a
machine called the "Shaman" that may do some of what you are designing
... the effects can be very interesting.  There're a couple of books
on this that could be stimulating to some subscribers of this mailing
list; "Would Buddha Wear a Walkman?" & the much earlier "Mega Brain".

There is also a now-quiet mailing list called "mind-l" that used to
have a fair amount of traffic on building machines like this,
reviewing products that appeared, organizing group buys, & the like.
I don't think anything happened to it, the audience stopped posting.
However, it still exists & the archives, resource guides, FAQ, & so on
still exist, & are available via anonymous ftp on asylum.sf.ca.us.
The mailing list is mind-l@asylum.sf.ca.us.  There is some form of
listserv running so I think the proper way of subscribing is to mail
to listserv@asylum.sf.ca.us.

Sorry if I'm preaching to the choir here but if there was ever a
better target audience ....

Oh & b-rave-o for the picnic & site, Andrea, Brian, & everyone else
who worked on the arrangements; it will sure be hard to beat or even
match the location (do try!), & it was great meeting y'all.

It's more random than that: I actually got my passenger-side car window
broken at the picnic.  Stupidly, I parked in a turnout on the road (next to
2wo other cars).  All three cars had their windows broken. Had I been less
lost, I probably woulda ventured on to the real parking lot... Fortunately,
it was just a simple act of violence and the (obviously stupid) fuckers
didn't steal anything -- not even my $350.00 portable-CD player, $250 in
semi-rare/import CDs, and my irreplaceable Tackhead "Friendly as a Hand
Granade" T-shirt.

Since there were two other cars that got "hit", if any others on the list
were affected by this, please contact me @ mayer@hplabs.hpl.hp.com ||
(415)584-1236. We may need to be witnesses for each other w/r/t insurance
and all that booty.

Fortunately, I didn't care that much cuz it was a nice day and an even
nicEr evening... :-)

PS: And besides, I'll sacrifice my car window to the revolution! I heard
Bush's "law & order" speeches on the riots -- yer basic vintage
Hitler/Mussolini but with this evil/paternalistic "trust me" hypnotic tone
-- friendly fascism. I think of how all these lies are going to be
swallowed by the mass o' white suburbanites, I think of people that are
willing to discard a few constitutional niceties in order to make sure
their picket fences remain whitewashed and their lawns untrampled.

Don't need a weatherman to tell you which way the shit's flying.

PS: anybody pick up a pair of bar-b-q tongs? Could I get 'em back at the
next one?

I don't know foetus, but I think we should remember that what

Brad Allen eulogized the Top:

Sort of -- you still had to knock on the door to get in.  It seems
like street people and folks from the projects didn't quite qualify.

Nonetheless, it's really sad to see the place closed.  Now where will
we find out where the Full Moon Rave is?  Maybe Zanzibar or some new
club will fill the void...

Shouts out to all who made the picnic a brilliant experience --
especially Brian and Andrea, and our wonderful volunteer DJ's
Paul, Pete, Eden (sp?), Robbie and Scott, and anyone else I missed.

Yeah.  The sound system and DJs at the picnic were better than the sound system

Subject: Crunch Berrie Rave, Seattle
Status: R


Sorry, would have given advance notice but I just found out about this 
one the night it gave birth (Saturday 5/2).  At any rate, here's the scoop.

It was GREAT!!!!  It was across the street from the ReBar (a really 
outrageous club in its own right, best on Thursdays), in this building 
that is a ramp-up flat level parking garage above and just a huge 
enclosed empty space underneath, big enough for several skateboard 
ramps.  I got there about 1:40, just before the line got really huge 
from all of the clubs letting out.

The GyroTrons they had are pretty crazy.  Picture five hula hoops of 
different sizes, arranged in concentric rings (somewhat like the orbit 
of the planets around the sun).   Each ring is connected to the next 
ring inside of it.  You stand spread-eagled (much like DaVinci's 
diagram) in the center hoop, feet on one side and hands holding the 
other and there is a harness that locks around your waist, holding you 
in place.  Then the operator starts spinning the exterior hoop against 
its axis (so it cuts a spherical pattern in the air), causing each of 
the internal hoops to spin similarly, but in different direction.  You, 
in the center hoop, first go head over heels, and start twisting 
sideways, backwards, rotating left to right in a totally unpredictable 
fashion.  There were two of these things operating on different sides 
of the space, and there were huge lines to each of them.  Looked like 
tons o' fun.  I'm going to try them out at the next Captain Crunch rave 
(in about 3 weeks).

The music was great;   DJs were Dominator from Seattle and Maxi and 
Devistator from LA and they CRANKED.  This rave just had one set of 
tables operating at a time (which was logistically elegant--the DJ had 
total control over the sound in this wide open space).  The sound 
stacks were about 8 feet high and thirty feet long, all told.  The air 
had a physical presence from the sheer sound these guys were putting 
out.   The smart bar seemed pretty cool.  They didn't serve alcohol 
which decomplicated things considerably and no one seemed to need it 
anyway.  The only neg was the facilities challenge, which was a noxious 
hassle.  Everyone there was having a ridiculously great time.  Met a 
lot of people there I knew and have the goods on three of four 
different raves happening up here in the next three weeks.

	Satta.

P.S.  Seattle's been going through its own pains on the spontaneous 
combustion/mob psychology violence score, but it's been pretty minimal. 
 We've had a number of demonstrations involving shutting down the 
freeways with hundreds of protestors and protesting in front of the 
main Administration buildings for the seat of the county government.  
It's been random innocent-business owner-victimizing- window-breaking 
stupidity and one apartment complex got torched.  But on the upside, 
the whole thing sure has gotten a lot of people talking.

Nicely put... This is NOT the place for flames.  It just detracts from the fun
and informative purpose of the list.  Plus it tends to degrade what I feel is
a growing sense of community among us sfravers!

> >I apologize for using this mailing list for this purpose.
> 
> ditto.  It's getting too politically correct around here for my tastes.

YES!  This is not a newsgroup, but rather a means for all of us on the mailing
list to interact and communicate and inform each other.  Vitamin B  could
 verify this, but I'm willing to bet that there are less than 200 people
subscribed to the list.  Obviously we, the sfraves subscribers, share a common
interest, i.e. the desire to rave.  That is what we should focus on on the
list...info and discussion of raves.  Any opinionated posts, flames, etc 
would be better sent to alt.rave or elsewhere.  The list is not a place to
share our differences, but rather a means for us to explore our common
interests and (if we're lucky) to get to know each other...

Okay, umount /dev/preachy.soapbox...I'm *glad* that the police didn't make it
too hard for the ucsc protesters, that way no one gets hurt.  Property damage
can be repaired...Let's not judge each other's means of political expression.
If we MUST be political on this list, let's discuss ways to politically 
influence the world in a positive manner using the friendly outlooks that 
(good) raves generate!

hi y'all!
well, we heard an interesting account of the ucsc riot from foetus. in essence
not that different from what happened in la, modulo the burning and
looting. so what did you  folks accomplished ? you vented some anger, made
a bit of noise, but changed nothing. to get ALL sc involved in shutting
down sc, you need to get more people involved. look at e. europe/china.
you can get more peope involved by TALKING with them, not bash them on the
head or burn their store. i should say that at least your group targetted
the police station. why not put in some of the positive energy that raves
have generated ?

hi again!
i really enjoyed the picnic. the location was excellent  and was good
to put faces with the e-mail names.  i went to the equinox later that
night and caught about 20 min. of music. it seemd like a good sweat box,
good music, positive vibes. the cops unofortunately used theid arbitrary
powers to close it down. a bunch of us went to carefree, saw some of you there.
i have to say that i could not really get into it, partly from beeing bummed
by the equinox eclipse, partly from the poor musical choises of the dj. i was
just waiting for 7 am to roll. we went to zanzibar, which was really good -
better, in my opinion, than carefree. glad to meet the sacto rave posse -
hi jgosine! there was this really good moment when some of us were really
getting into the music: i was drumming on the table top with my sticks, some
one else was hitting a tambourine and many people were dancing on the bar.
it  was very energetic, a positive ending to a rather down weekend.

how'd you guess ?
I hate being so obvious.

>Nicely put... This is NOT the place for flames.  

Thanks for the compliment.  I'm known to flame quite a bit myself,
but *usually* only when unjustly accused of something.
And then, there are a couple of "personalities" that I
have a mutually-consenting-adults-flame kind of relationship with.
(Partha ?)

>YES!  This is not a newsgroup, but rather a means for all of us on the mailing
>list to interact and communicate and inform each other. 

Yes, on sfraves there's been a tendency to jump on other people.
I suspect the people jumping have never made complete idiots of
themselves the way I have via flaming.  I learned a lot
by making a fool of myself for an audience.  It's embarrassing.
Now, I try to stay quiet until I've been able to think the
issues over a little bit.  I've had to apologize/say I'm
sorry/say I'm stupid less frequently.

For example, the recent discussion of whomever it was being
approached by a transexual.  Well, it startled the person,
and effected his/her impression of the place being described.
So what ?  I'm a woman too, and I know how intolerable some men
can be, but so what ?  You learn to deal with it eventually.
Women can be pretty intolerable sometimes too.

>If we MUST be political on this list, let's discuss ways to politically 
>influence the world in a positive manner using the friendly outlooks that

I find it hard to disagree with this statement, but all we can do is
try, and people can flame away to their hearts' desire.  It's just,
well, if it gets personal, please take the war to e-mail, and just
cc in everyone who's involved.  Where I come from, it's considered
adult-like to suggest that something be taken to e-mail by
one of the parties involved before it gets too personal.
The list rarely wants to hear about it.

So, I'm obviously procrastinating on a project due last week.

I'll try not to make a habit of philosophizing on sfraves.

I don't see anything wrong with a little philosophizing, as long
as it has *something* to do with raves.

As for flaming, that strikes me a being downright un-ravelike
behavior.  I agree with Ovid, we should try to maintain an
atmosphere of acceptance and tolerance.  If you have an overwhelming
urge to flame someone, I think you should go directly to private
e-mail and leave the rest of us out of it...

...unless it's a particularly good flame, of course  ;^)

Actually, Scott and Robbie aren't that involved in WC, according to them.
They are doing a bit of promotion, and spinning, and that's about it.
The site isn't selected yet.  I'm sure the prospects of it going all night
are dicey unless it's at a licensed club.  It's always going to be
that way, Jai -- just one of the facts of rave life.  The underground
ones are more fun, but the plug can be pulled at any time.  Adds to the
excitement when it does work out, though.

On the recent subject of flames, I think it's important to point out that
a subject should be taken to e-mail in the begining if there is a possibility
of flames (usualy predicatable).  Otherwise, we can't expect someone to not
defend themselves publicly if they were flamed publicly and thus the escalation
begins.

Howzabout if we get alot of speakers, amplifiers, DJs, synths, samplers,
drumz and other noisecreators and have a acidhouse/cyberpunkrock/space jam
session? (Whatever happened to the good old soundsystem ideas of early
clail, tackhead, mark stewart anyways?).

Might be more fun than blowing on whistles, no? 

Anybody have a spare warehouse or rehearsal studio?

is there anyone out there who would be willing to contact me once a week

Come-Unity should be fun.  It started about a little over a year ago, and was
really hot last summer, every Tuesday night.  It sort of wound down last fall,
but they've started them up again roughly once a month.  You can almost count
on most of hard-core rave kids to be there, and the music will be great, with
Jeno and Garth spinning.

I went last month and had a fun time -- it was almost as good as last summer. 
There were a few times last summer when it hit critical mass and the entire
place was screaming and whistling and dancing hard.  Up to then, I had never
seen such a high energy level.  It starts picking up around 12:30 and the
energy level keeps increasing up until 2:00 or 3:00.

It's a cool space -- they use just the lower back dancefloor at 1015 folsom. 
The room is just the right shape for concentrating the dancing energies.  Not
too big, not too small, and the high ceiling adds volume.  The sound system is
one of the best around and the lights are fantastic.  They've even added a
chill out room.  Definitely a good time.

Check it out if you have the chance.

Tim

A few months ago the DJ magazine "Dance Music Report" did a special techno
issue, and they listed the addresses of all of the techno labels in the US.
They will be putting out their second techno issue in June or July.

I believe that's what Extreme Noise Terror does.  They're performing at
Townsend some time this month (but it's on a Tuesday or a Thursday).

Extreme Noise Terror was interviewed by Mondo 2000 a few months ago.
And 10 years ago, when they were Rhythm and Noise, they were interviewed 
in Research magazine's "Industrial Culture Handbook".  (The Research 
interview
was truly wretched, though.)

	"Saturday, May 16th - Wacky Citrus - 415-541-5058, 415-281-0635 - UK DJs
        Karl Cox and Colin Favor, SF's Ernie Munson and Scott Hardkiss,
        and LA's Jon Williams."

	Well I can't comment on most of the DJ's mentioned in this mailing 
	list, with them being from the States I haven't heard them, but.
	If you can go see Colin Faver (Very, very good) and Karl Cox
	who is arguably the best DJ in the UK. Of course this is only an
	opinion but if you like hard Techno music theese two are a treat.

	Cheers,
	Gary.

this article is from `Public Eye' section of The Metro, april 30-may 6
edition.  i have no idea how true most of it is, but it seems
sympathetic to the rave cause, and it is an interesting account of
what happened to Intemperance & Destiny's doomed `Deep Rooted House'
event.  For some reason, the paper likes to uses ellipses (...)
rather than paragraph breaks.  I have rectified this.

CRIME RAVE: Although it's facing a dramatically reduced budget, the
county Sheriff's Department apparently has no qualms about spending
large amount of public cash to bust illegal dancers.

Around 1 AM Sunday morning, 15 deputy sheriffs swept into Saratoga
Springs and attempted to shut down a Woodstock-like dancefest that was
billed as Northern California's first-ever outdoor ``rave.''  The
Sheriff's Department says the bash was illegal because its organizer,
San Jose mechanic Steven Cohen, had failed to obtain the required
permits.  According to county ordinance B-3112, it's a crime to throw
a dance party without government permission.

Pulling the plug on the rave, however, proved to be a logistical
nightmare.  Most of the youths who attended the event (admission was
$15) had been ferried to the rave by a shuttle service that operated
between the resort area and Saratoga High School.  To take them back
to their cars, the Sheriff's Department hired three county transit
buses, and a transit supervisor.

Still, the party-goers boogied well into the night.  When deputies
ordered disc jockeys to turn off their amplifiers, the crowd kept the
beat going by banging on cowbells, clapping hands and blowing
whistles.  At one point several hundred sweaty youths -- many sporting
huge Mad Hatter-type hats and swaying rhythmically to the digitized
syncopations of high-tech ``house'' music -- gathered around a Honda
Civic equipped with an Alphasonic sound system and 12 Cerwin Vega
speakers

By 3 AM the party was pretty much over, except for a few ravers who
camped out.  There was only one arrest.  Later that morning, Cohen was
busted on an outstanding warrant stemming from a previous party in San
Jose.  He was released Monday.  Sheriff flakkie Sgt Ken Kahn tells us
the department intends to make Cohen pay for the cost of policing the
rave.  Kahn couldn't provide an exact figure, but he says sheriff's
deputies usually charge $24 an hour.

Cohen, meanwhile, says he plans to sue the owners of Saratoga Springs.
He charges that it was their responsibility to have the required
paperwork, not his.  ``If I knew that they didn't have a permit, I
could've gotten one myself for 25 bucks.''

Subject: On Mail and Mandibles, or How to Have Fun
Status: R

One thing that I have found to be true from my own experience, and
have since found to be especially true of the Rave experience, is that
the party is always in your mind, first and foremost.

To wit: calling this or that "rave" or "b&t", or deciding that this is
"house" and that "techno", is really a reflection on the appellator as
much as the object.

Rave is not about objectivity. It is a subjective experience that
cannot be shared, only mutually experienced. Appellations are
meaningless. You can't take a photo of a hallucination, and you can't
make a firm distinction between Category A and Category B, especially
with a world full of Maxwell's Demons (some call them artists) busy
blurring the distinguishing lines as fast as you can draw them.

This may seem obtuse, but it brings up two crucial points about this
mailing list:

1) Arguing about distinctions is difficult, since so-called "objective
reality" is a delusion -- hopefully shared by the person you are
talking with. With Rave, it is even more futile, for reasons above.

One might wonder, therefore, why people insist upon fighting about
these distinctions -- especially on this list.

2) One doesn't go to the Rave, one brings the Rave with them. If you
have difficulty with transporting an attitude, might I suggest that
the next time you go out, you should bring friends and toys to provide
a layer of psychic insulation to protect your rave mindset.

The wise student will realize that he is the creator of the fun, not
the consumer, and therefore will do well to make the fun happen, as
opposed to measuring it in watts and metres, and by measuring finding
it wanting.

ps. Please realize that this list generates about 100 mail messages
per week. Each message takes several minutes of several hundred

time to keep 5-10 people employed full-time. Please do your part to
make sure that that time is used effectively.

I don't know about y'all, but I had a great time. Thanks to Tim H. and
others that recommeded this rave.

Basically, I liked the atmosphere: the crowd seemed friendlier than some
other raves I've attended. The size, IMHO, was just right -- I never liked
huge crowds and cavernous halls that much anyways. Chill out rooms provided
safe haven against an occasionally relentless techno mindfuck. Music was
mostly excellent, modulo a few rough and ragged cuts, and a few places
where the beat was too simple&monotonous. $5.00 price was right.

Party people in the house listen up -- Please tell us when/where the next
one is happening!

Who billed it as that?  What do they consider the full moon raves?

That makes sense... every self-respecting campsite *I've* ever heard of

OK, OK, I take back what I said.  No more philosophy on sfraves.  ;^)

Actually, I was completely wrong.  Extreme Noise Terror is a rock band from
England.  Naut Human's multimedia collaborative effort is called Sound Traffic
Control.

So I walk into the Top
because it's open again
but my mouth had to drop
because it looks so plain.
The red curtains are gone
and the wall paintings have changed
the music is raggae  blah blah lawn.
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah schmanged

arrrrrggghhhhhh *#!@ the poem, it's too much work......

So I walk into the Top and it sure has changed.  I went there last night 
(Tuesday) and the music now is raggae.  The new managers repainted the walls
from red to white and brown, I think.  They took off the old paintings and 
hung new ones up.  They took down all the red curtains hanging between the 
dance floor and the main floor and those hanging behind the front windows 
facing the street, and shazoooooom!, suddenly the place doesn't look anywhere 
near as cozy as it used to.  The volume button for the music was set to 12 
(out of 10) and it was difficult to hear any talking above the music.
The place looks so stark now!  It kinda looks to me like
what a living room in a hospital would look like: very institutional, if you
pretend the bar and dancefloor aren't there.  Oh well, oh well, I guess the Top
has gone through a significant change and I ain't going there no more.  :-(
No more house music, no more cozyness, no more house crowd, no more 
crowd. :-(
I do enjoy reggae though, but not at the new Top.  

Does anyone know where to spend Tuesday and Sunday nights in the house 
scene
now that the Top is gone?  I went to "rave" for Peace last Sunday night but it 
was almost empty.

- TAXI

PS. ComeUnity on Tuesday night was great: great crowd, great
atmosphere, overt friendliness, great music, it wasn't too big and it
wasn't too small.  Plus many of the people there were hard-core
ravers: nice bunch of people.

Since Rave for Peace was empty maybe all the sfravers can meet there every
Sunday.  We can have our own rave and have a rave good time.

Sunday night is techno night at the Cactus Club in San Jose.

They call it NEMESIS.

I went there a couple times and found it to be pretty good (my standards are 
kinda low, though). The music was hardcore |) and there were some interesting 
people to watch. It was definitely a club atmosphere, however.

If anybody's in San Jose on a Sunday night, they should drop by. It is
free before 9:30 and cheap after that ($4 I think).

I assume they mean 2AM Friday night/Saturday morning.  Wicked was popular 
last
summer/fall and was at 2AM Friday nights/Saturday mornings in the basement 
of
Big Heart City.  It stopped when everyone went down to LA for some big 
weekend
rave, and there was no one there to organize it.  

Wicked is put on by the Full Moon Massive, which overlaps with the Come-
Unity
crowd (same UV-smiley face), so it should  be fun.  Sounds like they may be
starting up Wicked again, the same way the restarted Come-Unity.  I think
Martini (straight upscale DV8-ish crowd) is still going on at 1015 Folsom,
which is after hours, too, so I'm not sure how that will work.  There is a
seldom used basement at 1015 Folsom, so maybe that's where it will be, in
keeping with Wicked's basement past.  (There's a side door on the alley that
might be used to keep the two crowds separate.)

Remember Toon Town's b-day is tonight.  I was thinking of stopping by there,
figuring the hard core rave kids might be there, but if wicked is going on,
maybe I'll try that instead (and maybe that's where the rave kids will be)!

Share and enjoy,

Tim

Once again, TimH comes through with some crucial recommendations. Thanx!

"Wicked" sounds cool. I just wish that it would start earlier than 2AM. If
it starts at 2AM, that means it won't be going till 4AM, right? Urgh. All
this late-nightness -- must be a plot against yuppies like me.... mebbe
I'll see y'all there.

Scary thing is all the flyers for the TT bday on every other telephone pole
in the Haight. Sounds like its gonna be crowded.

I'm beginning to think that small raves located in existing clubs (such as
"small", "come/unity", and perhaps "wicked") are the way to go. If nothing
else, I've never seen that kind of rave get busted by Orificers of the
Piece (aka pigs, cops, etc).

--------------------

Re: all the negative e-mail.

Seems like half the volume on this list is being spent on what shouldn't be
talked about, what shouldn't be flamed, and so on. I'd personally rather
see a bunch of interesting flames, sarcasm, off-the-wall opinions -- you
know, real-life stuff. The uptightness, politeness, and mock-love of the
happy happy joy joy love love orthodoxy gets to be a bit tiresome because
it is so artificial.

Is the sense of community there only because we're all so wrapped up inside
our heads that we're never willing to let on what is really felt and
thought? "Love peace and understanding" is not going to happen if we're all
just silent dancers -- communication, disagreement, reconciliation are all
part of understanding and love.

Also, you gotta have a sense of humor about the absurdities of life, of
others, and of self if "love peace and understanding" is to have any
meaning other than some shallow reverberation of the lost ethos of the
60's.

Subject: Wicked
Status: RO

In the past, when there have been two events being held at 1015 Folsom (Martini 
on Friday nights) on the same night and with over-lapping hours, the side door 
(in the alley) has been used for entry. When I went to a Sharon there, they kept 
us waiting in line for a long time, and when we got to the door, it cost us 10 
bucks.  Had I known that ahead of time, I'd have walked around to the front 
door and paid the same 10 bucks to go into Martini and not wait in any lines. The 
music was exactly the same (same room, same crowd, same everything). 
(Actually, now that I think of it, it was a Candyland not an official Sharon). 
Anyway, consider yourself warned, if the lines are long, then go around to the 
front. Martini closes at 4 am, so don't expect Ira to throw all the people out at 2 
am and let ravers in. The dance music room (aka The Pit) had some house, some 
techno, some rap, and some popular music. I don't know how they're gonna 
pull this one off with Garth and Jeno DJ'ing. Expe!
ct jazz in the basement.  

Martini was actaully pretty good in it's heyday (disco/funk/soul room, and The 
Pit, and Mama's downstairs (live jazz)).  But like I said, when I went to 
Candyland last year, there wasn't a separate room for the ravers to party, 
everybody mixed, and listened to the same dance music and had access to the 
same rooms, etc. So caveat emptor!

 hi y'all!
i just came from the first night of the powwow. it was great. drumming all
night long with dancers from all over america, split up in age groups, doing
various dances: the grass dance, the traditional, the fancy. the whole
atmosphere is quite good. i'll probably go tomorrow afternoon as well, after
gorby's speech. i'll be in the lambskin coat and A hat (no 's). see
some of you there perhaps.

I was just wondering if anyone has heard of an outdoor rave this weekend. 
I've heard vague rumors of one near Half Moon Bay, but I'm pretty skeptical.
I'm hell-bent on going to an outdoor rave before I leave the Bay Area (in 
June) so if anyone has any info about outdoor raves in the future, I'd love
to hear about it. E-mail me if you have any good tips.

Subject: ToonTown :(
Status: R


I went to ToonTown's bday.  It was my third rave, and it wasn't as much
fun as anticipated.  The macho attitude was present, and it really created
a lot of bad vibes for me.  Homophobes threw things and pushed people into
me and my boyfriend as we kissed.  I witnessed the same group persistently
propositioning this girl - continuing to kiss and "sweet-talk" her even
though she made it clear she wanted to get by them.  Also, the music was
mediocre and wasn't mixed very well.  The space was cool and the lighting
effects were fun, but it was hard to get into it (especially on the weak
stuff I was on).

For my boyfriend, it was sort of sad - he's been into the scene since last 
summer and knew ToonTown when it was hardcore.  I guess it was to be
expected, considering the heavy mainstream advertising they've been 
pushing (read: ufo's).  

Damn, should have saved that energy for Mr. Floppy's!

I know this is all really basic obvious stuff, but perhaps
someone will benefit? 

The experience one has, at any place and time, is as much
created by the self as by the people around him/her. Indeed,
with raves, this is one of the most important aspects:
bringing with one a good mood and a willingness to create
for ones self and for others good feelings.  As well as what
one creates ones self, there is an amazing wonderfulness and
synergy to these feelings and more created when these
feelings of good are shared from one to another. One of the
implicit ways this is shared during raves is on the dance
floor where the floor is covered with people using it to its
fullest, and where people are intent on helping each other
feel accepted, warm, whatever; one can be euphoric in such a
place, even without chemical catalysts! 

These delightful and good feelings have as one of their
catalysts people who know all these things.  While one can
have a good time anywhere, it isn't the same as when there
are others like minded in these ways. People not knowing
these things offset the ratio.  Some of the common ways for
people not knowing these things to show up at raves are with
(overly) wide advertisement (such as big posters on every
telephone pole, mass media advertisements).  Another way I
found out recently is for a bar which uses the same place
for a  dancing event starting at 2AM after another function
just ended. 

(Bizhan, thank you for your comments, they are most true and
depicted a similar story to what happened Friday.  I wish I
had read them earlier ...) 

Learning all this, I was disappointed with Wicked ($7) and
didn't really expect anything more than what I got at
ToonTown ($10) ... and reading my own advice worked well
when I decided to think about things while dancing at around
5AM ... it's nice being submerged in the earth where one
cannot see the sun, even though it easily lights up the
surface brightly. 

I missed Gorbachev (I overslept) -- what did he say? 


btw, what does everything think Wacky Citrus will be like? 

I should find all my flyers and send them to Vitamin B, but
I'm sort of burning out on the task (it's a lot of paperwork
and effort to collect all these flyers!)  One interesting
one is worth mentioning: 

Rave for Peace, Golden Gate Park @ The Band Shell
Free for all, Saturday May 16, 11am-6pm

(Don't forget there should be a full moon rave sometime
around the 16th, as well as an unknown time & point for High
Summit (on Hamilton), as well as Wacky....) 

Of course, that's the same day as a zillion other raves and
events. Suggestions, anyone? 

See everyone around!

I apologize for having to do this, but I am unfortunately the one
who has to kick the mailing list off of our site.  Why?
We are a cluster of Apollo SINGLE-USER workstations, yet
we have just about 4,000 accounts.  This makes for a SLOW cluster,
and for a cluster which is prone to crashing.

We have one machine partially dedicated to mail, and that goes down
just when we have normal mail, let alone mail to mailing lists
with over 150 people.

Thus, in order to provide the maximum service to our local users,
we can no longer afford to provide the mailing list service
to this mailing list.

I apologize for the inconvenience.  I understand that Mr. Behlendorf
has arranged for the mailing list to be moved... For a short while,
you will still be able to send mail to this site until you get
used to the other site -- we will provide a pointer upstairs to 
the machine on which the mailing list will hopefully find a 
(semi)permanent home.

Thanks for understanding,

San Jose's EARGASM info line has changed to 415-267-1822.  This will
tell you of the majors and is updated often...also a San Jose underground
rave scene has finally emmerged.  Although the location shifts we are
usually raving at Curtner and Stone in Willow Glen with a bus (real
greyhound) and a map point at the Alma Light Rail Station in Downtown
San Jose. The music is incredible (w/Spun & others) and it is very
underground, no more than $10 at door.  Very spacious, I'll update
as to locations for upcomming wknds, but also note raves will be now
every wed at One Step Beyond, 1400 Martin Ave, S.C for 5 dollar cover.
Very excellent...

hi  ravers!
i agree with much of what brad said. i guess a rave works really well
when there are a lot of people with positive energy, on similar vibes
so that a collective vibe forms, kinda like a resonance. in this
state there occurs this amazing new kind of global communication, without
words, intelligible to anyone. and yes, some chemical catalysts , can
facilitate this - alcohol is NOT one of these catalysts, which is why i
don't think that its presence is terribly good at a rave, IF we are
trying to create   this golbal type of communication. it is good for other
things, a more localised interaction.
anyway, before this is getting too heavy, i tought that the full moon is
on friday night - i.e. early sat. morning. is that when the f.m. ravs is ?

I'm finnaly gonna take the stand and defend alcohol.  It's not one of
my favorite drugs either, and I don't take it that often but when I 
want to take some drug, be it asprin or opium, I'll do it regardless
of if it's "pc" or not.  I think real ravers know how to take there
drugs.  A little alcohol is not so horrible.  The problem most people
seem to have with it is the way it makes people belligerent which is
NOT condusive to the rave atmosphere/message/culture BUT the kind of
people who drink to that point or get like that are the kind of people
we all are always complaining about and who shouldn't be at raves anyway.
Actualy, maybe they should and hopefully they'll catch on to what's up.
I think the underground raves needn't wory about alcohol because it 
doesn't seem to cause a problem.  Raves like Toon Town, etc. should
get rid of their dumb bars as far as I'm concerned.  That would be the
best thing Toon Town could do in my opinion.

p.s. This message is a reponse to ovid's message but it's not pointed that

Short report on Wicked-
Good (not great) small rave in the basement at 1015 Folsom (I think) on 
Sat. night.  Had it's ups and downs but the downs weren't realy down, just
DJ or dancefloor lulls.  Met some good people.  I felt a community atmosphere
and was at the giving and receiving end of sharing at different points 
throughout the evening (morning).  Noticed deadheads who came from the 
Jerry
show at the Warfield and danced all night.  Good people, same ideals and 
energy.Didn't see any sfraves buttons but did notice and converse with Taxi, who 
is
always noticeable with his blue and white striped elf's hat.  One mildly
amusing story:  My friend steve and I accidentaly paid and got into 
"Martini" which was going on at ground level.  We couldn't figure it out
for the longest time why things weren't "right".  Finnaly, while searching
for wicked without even realizing it, I stumbled outside and was asked by
and eager bunch "is that the door to the underground rave?".  I instantly
figured it out, went back inside, grabbed a (usualy) clueless Steve, and
proceeded to the correct door.  At this point we had $3 between us but
we had rode on my motorcycle from the Berkeley at 2 in the morning and 
paid the right club for the wrong event and we were determined to get in.
After explaining our embarrasing story to consecutive levels of the
management hierarchy, a really cool guy named Luke (I think) said in a 
fatherly tone "Come on in guys, and let's get the right one next time, heh?"
Anyway, so much for my "short" report.

	To paraphrase LFO, the SFRAVES LIST IS BACK.

	This new machine, soda, will hopefully be much more capable of
sustaining the list. It took a bit of begging, so be kind to the list
you all... no flame wars, please! Thank you for your patience over the
past week - while some people have expressed their confusion and discontent
by unsubscribing, most of you were kind enough to just keep deleting the
errant messages. 
	I've processed all the new requests, as well as all the unsubscribe
requests, but I may have missed one or two - so if you still want off, even
now with the promise of a cleaner list, let me know. 

	To set it all straight - all posts should now go to sfraves@SODA.
berkeley.edu, all list requests to sfraves-request@soda, and all mail to
me to owner-sfraves@soda. I'll let the other relevant mailing lists and
newsgroups know, too. I hate this instability, but I think this is the 
end of it.

	As a bonus for your patience, I'm including with the post the updated
calendar, as well as a post andrea sent me about public-access unix accounts
for anyone out there who will be losing their school account in the next month.
(Oh yeah, a reminder - mail me if you're losing your account soon.)

	Phew..... now I'm off to study for finals (yeah right)

yahoo!  thanks for the perserverence and dedication to the rave
ideal above and beyond the call of duty, brian.  in the history of the
net, you will go down as a saint among list managers.

anyway, enough butt kissing.  to celebrate the return of sfraves, i'll
tell you all about brainstorm this weekend...

in a word, it sucked.  well, it wasn't really THAT bad, but it was
very non-rave-like.  it took place at the jack london club (aka The
Flophouse) in oakland, which i had never been to.  an interesting
space, to be sure - lots of twisty hallways and small rooms.  the main
dance floor is rather small but it was not crowded.  the sound system
was adequate but not particularly good - it gave me a whanging
headache every time i went near it, in fact.  contrast this to the
sound system at townsend, which was about a billion times louder but
not at all painful.  other items of interest were:

* a chill room with a layer of grass on the floor - fun for lounging
around in, and it smelled a lot better than the stale sweat aroma of
the dance floor

* a room done up to look like some sort of abbattoir - it was
obviously some kind of art statement, and fairly neat for that

* a room with a large TV running some sort of "new cinema" showcase

* a neato device with a tv camera and a screen.  you push a button and
it adds the picture on the screen to all the other images it has
stored up.  on the other side of the box is a different screen running
through all the stored images at a very high speed.  incredibly trippy
device!  (it was called the "imagebase")

* cool reggae band playing when we got there

despite all these attractions, the rave never really jelled.  a
certain indefinable "x-factor" was missing.  not a lot of positivity
from the crowd, i guess.  it was just sort of a
more-interesting-than-usual trip party, i guess.  oh well.

OK folks,
	Here your chance to give some much needed feedback for
a worthy cause.

A couple of friends and I are trying to organize a "rave-type" event
for the end of July.  (It's a rave-type event cause it only goes from
like 6pm till midnight)

We tentitively are calling it ECO-RAVE.  It would be a fund raiser for two
non-profit organizations
			1) eco-rap
			2) battered womens' shelter

Eco-rap is an organization that promotes and encourages ecological
awarness and action in innercity areas.  


The tentitive dates are July 25 a saturday or July 26, a sunday

We can rent an area at the fort mason center with a capacity of about
300 - 400 This area divides nicely into three spaces so we can have
two simultaneous DJ's and a chill-out room.

We'd like to get a couple of "big name" DJs like SPUN Ernie DIG-IT , etc.
to do it pro-bono or at a reduced cost and would also be spinning
reggae, rap and world-beat in the smaller room and techno-rave in the
big room.

Unfortunately, we cannot go longer than midnight - this is flat.

Now for the market research (This is where you come in!)

---------------------- cut here ----------------------------------------------

1) Would think about attending such an event? [y/n]
2) Would you bring your friends? [y/n]
3) Would you tell your friends? [y/n]
4) Which day is better ? [sat. /sun.]
5) How much should we charge? [ <$5, $5, $10, >$10]
6) How importent is a killer light show? [zilch,important, absolutely]
7) How important is it to have "Big name DJs"? [zilch,important, absolutely]
8) Would you bring your mother to this event?[y/n]
9) Do you think we will make any money? [y/n]
10) Is this a good "first rave" event for a non-raver? [y/n]
11) Do you think people will come on a saturday if another
    "big" rave is happening on the same night? (remember we're
    thru at midnight.) [y/n]
12) Do you think people will come on a Sunday night, if they have to
    go to work on monday?
13) (optional) Would you be willing to help? What would you do?

Any Additional Comments:



please answer and return to geoffw@isys.com ASAP - thanks

A friend of mine heard on the TV news that CHP are desperately trying
to find out when the next full moon rave will be.

He said they were referring to a big outdoor Rave in California this
weekend. My guess is that the rave they were talking about is the big 
one that features Altern 8 and is probably going to be in L.A. and not
the S.F. full moon rave.

Any more news about when is going to happen?? I mean Friday (as Ovid said)
or Saturday (as Brian said)??
Does anybody know something about Wacky Citrus?? Is it a big one or what??

Love Peace and Rave on

Subject: Inside Edition - Rave (Tuesday 12:00am) - channel 5
Status: R

I sent mail yesterday informing everyone on the list that Inside Edition was
going to have a segment on raves Tuesday night, but the sfraves was not up
yet. Well if you didn't see it, here are some (negative) excerpts:
 
1) An ex-Raver was interviewed and he said there were a lot of sex going
   around.  He said he saw people having sex in dark hallways and in one
    rave, they were doing it on the dancefloor! They said it was caused
    by X.
2) They said there are nudity in the raves.  They had a hidden video camera
   showing a naked girl with wings, dancing. This is my type of rave ;-)  
3) They said mostly everyone is on X or laughing gas: 
    They were harrassing this quy because he kept saying x to everyone.
4) They said rave is very dangerous because two guys died from laughing
   gas. They assumed they were ravers because they had rave flyers in
   truck that they died in.

The raves on the show were from SoCal. 

Inside Edition really wanted to tell all the moms on what their kids are
doing at the raves.  At the end, the host was just nodding his head.

Probably not.  There's been only one rave here and there weren't any cameras
inside, just about as underground as they come.  The other "happening" was
completely lame (they played New Order and Happy Mondays) and there weren't
any cameras there either.  Warehouses are few and far between here.  I'm on
the verge of splurging for a sound system and setting up in a parking lot.

Back in the late summer of 1990, I accidentally videotaped this segment of
Inside Edition on raves. It was a total no-information thang, but fairly
benign. On top of that, they weren't even spreading any cool
disinformation, such as the nude winged angel and sex on the dancefloor.
What drugs were the TV-folk on when they saw all that? Maybe they were in
some suggestible state while the DJ was playing DAF's "Voulez Vous Coucher
Avec Moi" from Twitch #1? (note plug! -- can I get CD03 yet?)

Well, you know they won't be Inside Editioning the alchohol-inspired public
nudity that goes gland-in-hand wth the New Orleans Mardi Gras.  A common
occurance at that event is for ogreous beer-swilling southern men riding on
the floats to yell out "show yer tits" to women watching the parade. Women
who submit to their lecherous will (or fling their undergarments back) will
get thrown extra-special suuuper doooper mardi-gras beads. Feminism :-) has
crept into the scene of late because the women sometimes shout "Show yer
dick!" -- and in the gay quarter, they'll show the length and breast of it!

Shocking? Only in good-ol-protestant indoctrinated amerikkka! 

Just by way of further rambling, the reason why I recorded that
inside-edition segment is cuz I wanted to get some sound-bytes from this
reportage of the police department's use of pot-bellied-pigs as
drug-sniffing dogs. Totally stuuuupid! That segment, and the natl'
geographic segment on the sex lives of bats will definitely make for some
cool quoted-out-of-context "lyrics" in some upcoming techno/industrial
song.

"He envelops her with his bat-perfume!"
"The singer with the best voice will be chosen to sire the next generation"
etc.

Inside Edition reporters had a hidden camera in their bag.  Maybe they

That old thing?  You obviously haven't heard "Voules Vous '92" yet.  (But then
again, I haven't started it either.)

You just put a little note on the flyer saying, "get in free with a press
pass."  Then when they show their press passes, don't let them in.

This is tragic!  The full moon rave info is one of the greatest
contributions this mailing list can make to the sfrav-ing community.
Doesn't anyone have ANY leads?  A phone number?  Any friends who even
HINTED about the full moon rave?  Brian, have you tried calling
Garth's mom?  Ex-lovers?  Not-so-ex lovers?  This is URGENT!!!

Everybody, focus your rave energy!  If we're all visualizing at
120bpm, and synchronized, our pleas WILL be heard and transmission
WILL occur within the cosmic network thus established.  I know this
because my friend's cat said so.  (Well, actually, meowed so.)

Ready . . .

 . . . ENERGIZE !!!

No...
bad idea
i really wouldnt want anyone searching my backpack
first off - it would take WAY too much time and make lines for getting in 
a hell of a lot longer
secondly - well... you know

who cares if the press come in and take pictures and lie about it
there is no real way to avoid it
even when the reporters go to comercial events like Circa '92
they lie and call it an underground (with that May Company ticket master
booth as a map point, no less)
so bravo if they actually get into a real one
of course where they get these sex stories is something i would liek to know

take 84 west to Grandview road, and go uphill [quite a ways] to 320

I've got the location of the full moon rave but I didn't bring it with
me to work today.  It's tonight about 55 minutes driving south from
SF.  It's going to be held at someone's house in the foothills.  Watch
out for poison oak and poison ivy!!!  The cops in that area are quite
nasty and tend to bug you for no reason so be careful and don't draw
attention to yourself on the road.
If you want the street address, I guess you should call me up when I
get 'home'.  My number is (415)552-4938 and ask for TAXI.  I should be 'home'
between 8:30pm and 10pm tonite.  Identify yourself as a sfraver and
you will get the location.  By the way, since I am temporarily homeless and
staying with friends this is not MY phone number, it's my friends'
phone so be courteous.  This is the first time I've given out a
personal (even though it's temporary) telephone number over the net so
we'll see how it goes.  Do not leave any messages on the answering
machine because I won't return them.  Since the friends I'm staying
with will not be going to the FM rave, please don't bug them.
Happy raving :-}

Was Santa Cruz really the place to go?  What did your conduit say
about Santa Cruz?

Since the San Mateo County Sheriff got noise complaints and said that
the owner of the house didn't know everyone and that there were more
than a hundred people, we couldn't go in to the house, although I did
get to at least see it from the bottom of the driveway.

good music (at least when Scott Hardkiss came on), etc. Very funny to see normal

else? I would also say the mountain ranges where all the windmills are along

are still a problem.

Yeah, we sort of had a little post-midnight "rave diaspora".  Except this
time, instead of having our temple burned and being chased out of the Land
by the roman opressors and ending up all over the world, we had our party
broken up and we were chased out of the house by the Santa Clara PD, ending
up all over Northern California.  Oh well.  We still have our Zionist dream
of getting together and raving 'til the full moon is replaced by the morning
sun.

Well, one group of us went to the beach at La Honda.  Not many people, but
it was so beautiful.  The sky was very cloudy and so the moon didn't come
through, printing the world a four-ink grey.  It was calming and focusing.
An excellent way to wait for the sun to rise.

Cars are the big problem.  Instead of harassing us directly at the beach in
La Honda, they just started giving out parking tickets, which caused 80% of
the people to leave at about 3:30 (I think).  Is it feasable to charter
something so we can not use cars?  Or at least organize very large scale
integration of people into cars, ie lots of carpooling?

But it was a good experience.  Despite the fuzz and the parking ticket we
got.

ahh, what the heck, here it is ...

e info - practical information about ecstasy

* The multifaceted jewel *
Ecstasy catalyzes a powerful experience that takes many different
forms.  It can provoke an intense, energetic, spiritual high or lead
to warm, loving relaxation.  It can connect people freely and openly
with each other or promote deep inner thinking and analysis.  Sensual
yet not necessarily sexual, beautiful and sometimes dangerous, Ecstasy
covers a wide range of human emotions, experiences, and passions.
What you put into it is what you get out, so be sure to explore the
many facets of the experience.

* Those little annoying side effects *
Although some people say it has no side effects, Ecstasy is not the
perfect drug.  Users have reported a variety of mild physical symptoms
such as jaw clenching, teeth grinding, eye wiggles, tightened muscles,
sweating, chills, increased heart rate, blood pressure and body
temperature, auditory effects, nausea, shaking, and next-day
sleepiness.  Occasionally it can cause toxic reactions in people with
asthma, heart conditions, diabetes, epilepsy, psychosis, or
depression.  Remember, Ecstasy is a power drug.  Treat it -- and your
body -- with respect.

* As time passes ... *
Myths abound concerning Ecstasy's effects after repeated usage.  Most
claims (such as that it causes Parkinson's disease or drains spinal
fluid) actually refer to other drugs or common misconceptions.
Although scientists suspect some nerve terminal damage and
neurotransmitter depletion in the brain based on animal research, the
true long term effects and implications remain a mystery until further
human research becomes legal.  By avoiding the temptation to use
Ecstasy too frequently, you can lessen the risk and have more fun.

* Less is more *
An active dose of Ecstasy depends on one's body weight, sensitivity,
and prior use.  A typical "hit" contains 75-125 milligrams.  Over 175
milligrams increase side effects for many users.  Taking a larger dose
does not necessarily mean a better experience -- it may be more
"speedy," but less ecstatic.

* Methylenedi-what?? *
The chemical name for Ecstasy is "methylenedioxymethamphetamine," or
MDMA for short.  It is created in laboratories through an elaborate
scientific process.  First patented in 1914 by the Merck Co. of
Germany, its human use only goes back to the early 1970s, when it was
used recreationally and therapeutically.

Therapists found MDMA helped people to bring out their true feelings
in a peaceful and open manner, and they used it that way, quite
legally, for many years.  In the mid-80s it exploded into the
nightclub scene in Texas, and was promptly banned.

* What the government did *
In 1985, MDMA was declared illegal in the United States.  Despite the
objections of scientists, doctors, and even judges, it was placed
along with marijuana, LSD and heroin on Schedule I, a classification
of drugs with no recognized medical use and high abuse potential.
Although therapeutic use is no longer legal, it continues to be used
recreationally and socially.

* Be an informed shopper *
Useful facts about drugs can be hard to find among the anti-drug hype.
Here are some excellent books worth reading.  Try asking your local
bookstore to order them:

  `Ecstasy: The MDMA Story' by Bruce Eisner (Ronin Press)
  `PIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story' by Ann & Alexander Shulgin
     (Transform Press)
  `Pursuit of Ecstasy: The MDMA Experience' by Jerome Beck & Marsha
     Rosenbaum (forthcoming from SUNY Press later this year)

`Xochi Speaks', a full-color educational poster and booklet, provides
practical info on chemistry, dosages, effects, side effects, etc. of
MDMA and eleven other psychedelic substances, as well as general facts
about brain chemistry, nutrition, and the psychedelic experience.

Well I GOT IN!!!
And stayed till about 8 am and it was great!!

I arrived at about midnight, I parked my car along the side of 
glenview and started to walk the 1/4 mile or so to the house.
I had a flash light so I could see where I was going.  Eventually
three crusiers passed by me.  They got on the loud speaker and said
stuff like "The party's over kids, go home", etc.  I knew from previous
experience with the police that this is a typical tactic, but I also
know that you cannot win against cops with brut force unless you
GREATLY out number them but you can use the powers of the mind.  So I just 
walked right past them, my friends must have been to timid to follow cause
I climbed up to the hill to find the party IN FULL EFFECT, people were
goin' off all over the place.  I was have so much fun that I forgot about my
friends at the front of the road, so I went back down to get them and also
something I left behind.  Well I didn't see my friends so I went back up the hill 
only to be stopped by a cop saying that I couldn't go in, but I thought
fast so here's this big macho cop tellin me I can't go in, I may be big
but he's got a club and a gun and several other buddies who had the same.
So I say in my best "air head California accent, "Hey Officer, my girlfriend is
still in there with all those horny guys comon man gimme a break, I can't leave
her in there!"... and IT WORKED!! He said well, you look trust worthy,
you go get her and come back out ya hear!  "You bet Office ! Sure thing!"

So I got past the first Cop and was challenged as I went up the hill but
I just told then the sargent at the botton of the hill let me through, after the third 
cop they didn't bother me any more so I just went the rest of
the way and told other folks to beware if they tried to leave.

The party was still jumping, this was a BIG house situated on a hill
in a redwood grove.  There was a pool in the basement a chill-out area, in the
basement, and everyone was dancing outside near the garage.  After about 1/2
hour, the music stopped outside, I guess this was due to neighbor complaints.
But someone put music on inside the house and the party continued.  Some 
people
left other went down the hill to the back yard to sit around a HUGE firepit
with burning logs in it and just chill out.  There seemed to be a plentyfull
supply of X judging from the behavior of several people that I saw. After
about an hour , we cranked up the music again with the speakers moved to 
inside
the garage.  I don't know who was spinning but it kept getting better and 
better (with a few bad spots here and there). All in all, I had fun, I left
at 8 am.  I dove a few people to the City and crashed at a friend's house
for a few hours, waking up just in time for Rave for Peace.

sorry if you all got this, but as i mailed it my system said something about
/tmp being full and null body sent, hope thats ok.

anyway, i mailed brian and told him all about bonny doon beach, which 
i think would be a great fmr site.  you all can check your maps, it
is located where bonny doon road meets highway 1.

there is tons of parking, up and down the highway, all the way
to davenport, which is like one mile north.  johnny law does ticket
until a certain hour (eleven?) but the cost of a ticket spread about
the members of a carpool is easily much cheaper than toon town or something
big like that.

Bonny Doon beach would be a great site!!  Just for general edification,
I'll add that it's about 8 miles north of Santa Cruz.

After what I've seen go on at Bonny doon beach on the 4 of July, I'd say
anything goes.  Also, about a mile south of Stinson beach is a rock
climbing erea/nudist beach (Hey, nude rock climbing!) called Mickey's
beach in Marin county.  There is a big parking erea on Highway 1 above
it but the hike down might be hard for equipment carriers.  Also, I'm
not sure about who "ownes" the beach so I don't know the legal status.
I think it might also be called Red Rocks beach.

Status: RO

I went to Wacky Citrus on Saturday. I had been looking
forward to it for a long time, because the flyer was so
pretty. Here are my itemized opinions:

+ Excellent light show! The lasers and lights of color
  were the best I have ever seen. They had a four color
  laser, a red laser, and a green laser. Sometimes the 
  lasers would just scribble all over the walls and ceiling
  and it was like a very intense acid trip.

+ Good music. Ernie Munsen (or whatever) was spinning some
  incredible energy, and some people and I had to scream
  to release all the pressure that we couldn't get out
  by dancing fast enough. I think some guy named Blow
  played muted trumpet, and it was a truly beautiful sound
  backed by the pounding techno foundation.

- Environment. It was in the Fashion Center, and there
  was only the one big dance floor, nothing else. I
  didn't really enjoy paying $20 for it, but oh well.

- The people. There were some real ravers there, and 
  they were the ones who kept me going. However, most
  of the people seemed kinda clubbish, and I didn't get
  that feeling of community on the dance floor that you
  get at truly great raves.

Did anybody else go and have different impressions?

Apparently it will be a 500-person $30 rave

hi y'all!
i was also had by the woodside cops and just got to have a long drive
with jonathan and giamma and a friend of jonathan's (david ?). had a
great time at the peace rave, specially towards the end, when i felt there
was strong sense of communion with people  there, plus the music  was
really good then - any relation between these things ? i was going to
go to wacky citrus but the ridiculously huge ticketprice of $20 kept me
away - i mean, do we really need a huge space ? i went to sharon, which
was at big heart city. the location worried me a bit, since clubs have
a certain feel about them which somehow does not seem to provide that
rave atmosphere. it took me a while to get into this rave, plus the music
was not that good, imo, for quite a while. ti did get better around 4
or so. even thenm though, i did not feel any sense  of community, more
like small bands of people, with the bands not interacting with each other.
i went with a few other folks to dna around 6 am, and this was great! the music
was really really good, the place was very spacious, and there were some
cool flourescent paintings hanging around the walls. i also think they had
a great sound system - dna's ? i saw mykl and ruth there, but not many other
sfravers. there was also some brain food and body food for brunch. mykl or
anyone else who went to wacky citrus, how was it ?

I didn't like the music they were playing between 11-4am. They were playing
mostly new techno songs but not 'good' new techno songs. Most of the
djs were just cutting the songs and not blending them together for at least
8 to 16 beats.  One dj kept mixings the songs when there was no beat on it.
He sure didn't need to use the pitch controls. :-)  It would have been better
if they had Doc Martin and he mixed the whole night (and morning).

----------------

 There's lots of hidden valleys in Marin. If people don`t mind walking about
half an hour, they could legally park their cars in Mill Valley or Corte Madera 
and hike in. The downside is that a lot of the open space is parkland that 
is officially "closed" after sunset -- so the cops could still give us tickets 
if they could find us.  :~]

It's a correct molecular diagram of MDMA.  Many other pictures of
MDMA molecules are incorrect -- most notably the airbrush picture
that appears on both the Eisner book and the Psychic TV Ultrahouse
album.

The town of Bolinas, in Marin County, might be another good place. It's a pretty
remote town of a couple hundred people. There`s a few farms out there, and
it's right near the ocean, and there are lot of alternative 60's types how 
might even be sympathetic to the cause.

I liked Wacky Citrus just fine; the lights were superb and I got
used to the large dull space after a while.  I thought the people 
were a little younger than I'm used to seeing at club raves,which
was great; the community feeling was pretty good for a rave that
big, I'd say it was better than at the last Equinox or Higher than Heaven.

How about a real illegal rave at Fort Funston.  If you haven't been there,
they have tunnels and old military bunkers that was used for cannons. It's
really dark inside but when there's a full moon and no fog, the light will
shine thru the cannon openings overlooking the ocean. Also, it's sound
proof. :-)  There's also this place near Daly City, near Westmoor H.S.
The left front is a playground and the right side is a Mormon Church, but in
between there's this gate that leads to a cliff overlooking the Pacific
Ocean.  There's a path the goes about a mile downwards thru trees and bushes 
and ends up at an isolated beach.
The only problem is that the equipment has to be parachuted down the cliff.;-)

I don't know about Bolinas.  They are the closest thing around to an
intentional community, and might perceive it as an invasion [which it might
in fact be, considering how many people tend to show up].  I'm most drawn to
the idea of having it on private property [less red  tape than state parks]
with very good logistical planning WRT parking and carpooling [and
bathrooms].

It was truly funny to see all of the really drugged out dazed people
walk up the stairs and say "oh  my god it's sunny outside" very
annoyed at the sun.  I had much more fun at Sharon (until about 5am
when someone annoyed me and I left for the remains of Care*Free to
regain my psyche -- which didn't get regained until I went to I slept
last night, Really!; that big TV in ToonTown has got to go -- well,
perhaps, it was pretty trippy with psychedelic seens and a dancer in
front, nahh, too tvish). End Up was interesting -- awake people
talking happily and from all over, actually the vibes were bad at best
but somehow it was the right atmosphere for me to regain myself. 

Weary tired me (happier and more jovial about things) walked to Market to
get wahtever bus rumbled my way, and promptly got on an N (strange to get
on an N when the sun is shining bright!).  The N got stuck without a way
to get back to where it needed to go, and I had to cross all these crazed
runners just to get home.  I'm glad the band playing two blocks from my
house wasn't any closer; their musical selections could have been better ...
That's the thing.  Running doesn't fit the rave scene, I decided, and
slept quite well.

All in all a great weekend, my fun mostly at Golden Gate,
and I would have had a fun as hell time Friday if I had simply stepped aside
when the cops left (I should have!  Argh ...)

Hey, how about using one of these locations people have been tossing out
for our next PICNIC?  Which one or ones do you think we could use 
during the day?

------------------   
For all those people looking for raves in LA, I picked up a copy of
Urb magazine (one of those tabloid-like things like BAM, but this
one is for club music).  I guess it comes from LA, and it seemed like
every other ad was for a rave!  Of course, that probably means they
are all big-ass productions like the latest Toon Towns and Wacky Citrus,
but they could be good starting points if you don't know where the
more "underground" raves are...  I got my copy at Clothes Contact on
Valencia in SF, I think some of the record stores also have it.

Does anybody know anybody that has a farm not too far away? I know someone 
with  
one up in Sonoma... with Emu's, sheep, lettuce, etc. I don't know if people 
would be  
into the 45+ minute drive, though. I'm also not sure the owners would be into it 
!  
Anyway, a farm sounds like it might work.

  The mere trickle of mail bouncing in from the Rave list tells me that folks
are busy raving over finals etc. right now. So, just to keep the flow going:
  Last Sunday there was a "rave" in GG Park held in the music concourse. Decent
DJing, about 50+ people dancing when I got there. General good vibes and a 60s
feeling. It was fun to notice that sometimes the dancing would kind of droop
down to a perfunctory level; then suddenly awhomping bass line or thunderous
drum would come powering in, and you could *visibly* notice the energy level 
of
the dancing go up.
  I wore my SFR pin (thanx, Brian!) and it served as an intro to two other
netters. If you/we go raving this summer, be sure to stick on that button. It
makes for instant camaraderie -- nice if you're out solo at a rave.
  Ace those finals! "To rave is to affirm!"

	About making one of these the next location for our picnic - sounds
great! But how could we still have food/etc? What about something that starts
around 5 or 6 PM, and then we have food and get hyped up until sundown, at
which time we start bouncing like mad, finishing around 1 or 2 to go on
to the night's festivities. Or maybe we could think of something very
counter-culturish to do for three hours, and then make that a general-
admission event lasting until dawn....

	Re: Urb. Yes, it's a LA Club rag, actually not a bad magazine but
one of the elements most responsible for making the LA Rave scene as over
the top as its become. When you can pick the mag up at Music Plus or the
Wherehouse (which many LA outlets of those chains stock for free), what's
so underground about it? Ooops there goes my snobbiness again. They also
have many articles about the music, which is a plus in my mind, as well as
article about rap and acid jazz, which is also good. The articles could be
better written, but they're often very interesting. I have one with an
interview with Doc Martin in which he envisions weekend-long raves in the
desert with 20,000 people (what, doesn't he think LA youth have JOBS?
SCHOOL? :) Anyway, pick it up if you can.

	Coming soon... a current calendar, as well as my view of the
weekend's activities. My finals are OVER WITH!!! YEAH!!!

Seems like the ideal to me.  I've been checking for places around
Santa Cruz for awhile.  Good alnight beaches with adequate secure 
parking and space for hundreds are rare.  Vast meadows near the
coast, nestled among the mountains and/or redwoods, seem best.
Private, consenting poperty, with acres and attendants for parking,
trash cans and recycling bins, organic foods, juices, and 
smart products for sale at reasonable prices, and clusters of
Port-o-potties near the woods.  (With 'Beware of poison ivy' signs).
*All day Saturday (4th of July -- Rube Goldberg's birthday?!),  :-)
Saturday night, *and* Sunday, or even the weekend of June 13.
The summer solstice weekend (June 20 & 21) already has a few things
in the works.  We could start this thing over where Altamont left off
in '69.  This IS the 25th anniversary of The Summer of Love ('67-'92),
though many are already calling it The Summer of Raves.  Should be hot!

Bolinas is having a hard time turning away the hordes now.
Most of the townspeople weren't happy about the CNN press, etc.
they got last year.  It's one of my very sacred, special spots
in the universe to take a special friend.  (please don't quote me
on that;-)  Can't imagine what would happen if hordes of ravers
descended on them.  There are, perhaps, spots around Larkspur, or
perhaps the Lucas Ranch...    :-)

and, memorial day monday, 25 may, party in golden gate park from noon to
sundown.  preston has permits, including the coveted police department
noise permit, so this one should come off as expected.  location is the

Greetings earthlings!
	I too deeply regretted the $20 I spent on Wacky Citrus.  I think the 
crowd was overwhelmingly composed of drunken jostlers.  In addition, I do not 
think that the 'wall of sound' idea came off too well.  Perhaps, if you were 
close up front it was okay, but from where I was dancing there was terrific/
horrific base reverberations.  Now, despite the regrets, Ernie and Scott 
did justice to some fonkee beats that still drove me to dance all night long.
I saw quite a few friendly faces (I WAS wearing my SFR button this time!), and
I was coming from a pre-Citrus Rave warmup held in Davis.  So, I had a great 
time anyway.  
	If anyone went to DNA afterwards, this was really the place to be!  I 
think it was Robbie Hardkiss spinning(please forgive & correct me if I am 
backwards on these names!).  The floor was smoking with the happiest, 
energetic,
ravers from the night before.  The music energized me from 7 until 11 at which 
time our happy caravan trekked to Golden Gate Park.  WOW!!!  I'll let someone 
else describe it from here.

	Just one more thing.  Is it me or does everybody tend to have a great 
time no matter what?  On second thought, don't answer that...

Wow...seems like people had a blast this weekend...Pre-Wacky Citrus party,
Ravnic @ Golden Gate Park, FMR...not to mention the many raves this past
weekend in SF.  Sheesh....oh well...I even missed the pre-party up here
in Davis because my trip to a fraternity formal got moved up a bit.

Hmmm....well, anyway, are there any more SFR buttons around, Brian?  If
so, I'd like to get one if possible since I haven't had the time to rave
with the sfravers since the beginning of the quarter...

Subject: Resurrection
Status: R

At the end of a rather bumpy weekend (being intimidated away from the
FMR, enjoying a fabulous Rave for Peace, getting totally Wacky with
Citrus), the new club Resurrection at DNA Lounge Sunday morning was an
excellent spot to glide back to earth.  More spacious and less insane
than Zanzibar, the huge black-light art pieces made for one of the
best indoor ambiences I've experienced lately, and the DJ work by
Robbie Hardkiss and guests was inspired and inspiring.  Although
not particularly crowded (maybe 50 people in all) there was lots
of eye-contact, community feeling, what-have-you.  A high degree of
interaction between dancers.  The balcony upstairs makes for a good
chill space with a bird's eye view of the floor.

well when i went through the last Urb, i dont remember
seeing that many ads for raves (or maybe i just dont look at the adverts)

but i oculd be wrong, there were probably lots of clubs listings
and couple of ads for Mind Number and Techno Flight
and Gilligan's II
but then again i dont have it right in front of me so i could be wrong
but chances are if its in Urb, it will be way comercial
what that means.. i dont know... but that should be discussed elsewhere

Funny thing...
i was just about to post that y'all could get into a rave down
here for free when i found the exact message i was goign to type
(well not THAT exact) in my mailbox

well i called one of the numbers 2 weeks ago and it said something like
this :

There will be a free after party on Friday nite called MORE
that starts at 3 am (saturday) and then on saturday
there will be a free BBQ in an ampitheatre at a location to
be told later, and then a free rave that nite maybe,
and then Flammable liquid would be free and 
there would also be something on sunday but i forget what

now the voice mail box doesnt have a message, its just emtpy
but you can stil leave messages

AS TO MY POINT WITH THIS...
im not sure if i will get in free, i might since i was on that mailing 
list, or at least i left my name and address, but you never know

SOOOOO.....
i was wondering if i could borrow a phone # / address
of someone who was using it..  like saying that we both lived at the 
same address and were going down or i dont know
im just being really cheap and somewhat creative

BUT in light of this, i think that United Nations Under Sound will be a 
killer Rave this weekend and i hope a lot of you can make it

Unless i get creative i will be wearing a pink button down t-shirt
and a KUCI Parental Advisory hat (but thats usually attached to my
waist) hmm.. im not really noticeable, except i spend a lot of time
with my head in speakers and if you have a SF Raves button, i'll 
definitely say hi

Subject: Bolinas
Status: R

I know there's a lot of skepticism about Bolinas as a possible rave site
because of their reputation for xenophobia.  On the other hand, the town
also has very heavy 60's counterculture vibes, and might be receptive to
what rave culture has to offer.  The only way of resolving this would be
to find some actual Bolinas residents (possibly friends of someone on this
list) and run the idea past them.  I know it's a slim chance, but the
possibility of it working out is intriguing.

aftEr rEading many diffErEnt and discording rEviEws about Wacky Citrus,
i likE to makE a point: 
		going to a ravE is a "GROUP" EXpEriEncE.

what i mEan is that thE fun and also good part about ravEs is that EvErybody
should try to participatE in a vEry friEndly and opEn way: thE EnvironmEnt
(music, club, lights, pEoplE and somEthing E..lsE) is important bEcausE it hElps
to rEach a statE of thE mind in which wE all arE morE willing to mEEt nEw 
friEnds and dancE in group (using whistlE, watEr guns or whatEvEr). But if 
somEtimE thE EnvironmEnt is not pErfEct, this doEsn't mEan that thE ravE is 
going to bE boring, it's up to us to makE it fun.
how?? wEll i don't know but wE should al lEast try and also wE shouldn't
dEcidE too soon that thE ravE is not vEry good.
how many timEs did happEn to you that a boring ravE suddEnly changEd in 
somEthing vEry intErEsting and fun?

i pErsonally didn't go to Wacky Citrus but i had a grEat timE at Sharon whErE 
i saw many SFRavErs (Brian, Ovid, MikE, PEtE, DErEk, Jon, Jonathan, Brad, 
NiEls 
and thEir friEnds, sorry if i forgot somEonE). thE music wasn't grEat and so thE
placE but i think that most of thE pEoplE thErE had a good timE.

what is rEally grEat about this mailing-list is that is a pErfEct EnvironmEnt
for EXchanging informations but also for organizing prE and aftEr ravE partiEs.

pEacE lovE and ravE on			 giamma

p.s. doEs anybody know, whEn thErE will bE anothEr ravE in thE park??
     thE saturday ravE in thE park was rEally grEat. who organizEd it?

(1) the private party at townsend is the "delirium incident" -- this really
isn't a secret, nor is it very private. I picked up the delirium incident
flyer at the last come/unity but I haven't seen 'em elsewhere, so I guess
it only "semi private".

(2) I went to townsend last thursday because I accidentally thought that
was the night for "the delirium incident". Here's what I saw:

the good news is that they had an open bar from 10-11PM so I had about 5ive
drinks for free (i'm saying this to piss off the no-alchohol nazis). danced
for a while with my "date" (note I'm using this term to piss off uptight
language nazis)...  music was basically disco (e.g.  clinton's atomic dog),
rap (how i could just kill a man by cypress hill, plus some cuts offa Tribe
Called Quest "low end theory"), etc. DJ was "Amy Tran" (i think... this is
all from memory).

The bad news is that if you're looking for a rave, thursday's at townsend
ain't it -- basically, a complete mix of humans, ranging from B-boys and
youngish gangsta-lookin' dudes, to "house music" types, down to your
average club type folk dressed in nice clothes.

But for $5.00 w/ free drinks, it was a reasonable way of spending a few
hours.

			--------------------

Another very promising thang goin' on:

At the GG-Park rave for peace, I was chatting with the ever-friendly Mona B
and she handed me a photo of two hands with flyer information painted on
them.  Basically, at the old Underground on Thursday nights, Scott n'
Robbie Hardkiss will be doing a weekly (?) rave. I'm at work right now, so
I can't supply more details.

I'm probably going to check out the delirium incident so I'll give this
a miss this week. Then again, maybe I'll get bored and check it out anyways.

Not that I am one to condone drug use in any way, shape or form, but I
thought I'd put forth a small but significant addendum to those that are so
inclined -- BEWARE!!

I've seen numerous reports indicating that Prozac is quite unsafe -- I
believe investigations are underway that may get it banned by the FDA, even
for prescription use.

Basically, what happens is that some people that take it undergo a complete
personality change, including episodes of violence sometimes leading up to
murder.  I recall hearing something about 50 lawsuits pending where prozac
has been indicated in causing people to go completely ape-shit!

So, as they say caveat emptor, cave canem, et pro bono puella est pulcher...

			--------------------

PS: The scientist doing those rat-x-periments musta had lots o' fun. So
what do rats on X do? Bounce up and down crazily to techno music while
touching and loving each other? Or do they torture them with Wyndhole Hill
New Age musak overdubbed with lectures on getting in touch with the inner
rat-self through personal empowerment?? Why yes... I can see it now:

	Algernon IX: "Gosh Viv -- I just Looooove your cute lil' tail -- I
	need to feel it, and touch it and hold it cuz I got the POWER, I
	got the POWER, I got the POWER!!!" "Say, got any more chewing gum?"

	Vivisect VI: "Algie... Look Look... here comes that cutie humanoid --
	oo goody -- looks like he's getting ready to microtome
	our festive little brains after injecting us with toxic reagents...
	oooh ooooh.... I just Loooove it when that happens! ... I'm soooo happy!"

And finally, if given whistles, could the rats keep any semblance of rhythm
whatsoever? Enquiring minds want to know!

Dontcha just love SCIENCE?!!

This is true - Scott gave me this flyer himself :). I forgot to put it on the
list in the weekly section... anyway, it's called "Deep Faith", Thursdays at
210 9th Street, with the Hardkiss Bros, and "future guest spots" - Jeno,
Garth, Bones, Ernie Munson, Noel & many more. Finally something cool on
Thursday nights... what do other people know about the location?


Also, I wanted to say I had a ton of fun at Sharon on Saturday. True, I wished
it were at a more "underground" location than Big Heart City, but the layout
isn't bad there. I LOVED the computer animation/video art they had going on
a couple of TV's. And to he who said the music wasn't par, I must contest.
Spun was doing a great job mixing, had an excellent selection of music (what
was that song, Mike, Alien Encounters or something?). That was also the second
time I've heard him play Meat Beat Manifesto's Helter Skelter, which sounded
GREAT. *** I'm sure I annoyed a lot of people with my "found art" collection
that night, the traffic beacon hanging from my neck and the small flashlight
I kept shining around, my "intellabeam in a palm". The sound system was 
amazingly clean, too - I think the layout with 4 satellite speakers doing themids
and the highs, and two huge bass cabinets, works incredibly well. As for the
atmosphere... there were a lot of sfravers there, which made it very fun, and
many of the people there were easygoing and friendly, but the lighting man did
have the lights on too much for my taste. There was also this bizarre mating 
ritual going on in the middle of the dance floor around 5 or 6, between this 
scantily clad 5' female and a bare-chested 6'2" male, which at times came close
to what one could call techno-lambada... didn't seem to fit, anyways. It was
heartening to know that around 6:30, of the dozen or so hard-core dancers on
the floor, us sfravers comprised about half :)

	See ya at the Delirium Incident (maybe)...

Hi Kids!

I feel like it's been forever since I went out dancing, so I'm off to Housing
Project tonight @ the endup!  I'm bummed that I was out of town for the
weekend, but I'm back and a-rarin' to go.  (Ever had a mudbath -- I was all set
to go out dancing after my first mudbath this weekend, but, alas, no raves in
Calistoga!)  There were a few messages I wanted to respond to, so here goes...

A. is for apple

Giamma:  I lovEd your mEssagE!  Reading it right after Brian's review of
Sharon, I had an idea.  Brian sounded like he had a great time.  And other
people thought it was lame.  One of the things that affects your perception of
a rave is your state of mind, whether your state is chemically altered
or whether you're just in a good mood, and "high on life."   Either way, it
might be interesting for reviews of raves to include reviews of the reviewer,
because the first thing I think when I read two differering reviews of a rave
is "OK, were you on X?"

Like, maybe:  "I had the *time-of-my-life*!  I've never seen such a high
energy level!  Of course, I was on 16 hits of X, 10 hits of acid, and about 40
minithins..."

Or:  "Being in a good mood, I had lots of fun dancing and connecting with
people on the dance floor."

Or:  "It was awful, but then I realized I was in a shitty mood and no wonder
I'm not having a good time..."

Just an idea.  Not that it sounded like Brian was on X, or anything!  :-)

B. is for Bambam (as in "...and Pebbles")

Someone asked about 210 9th St., where the Underground used to be, regarding
Deep Faith on Thursdays.  A gay leather bar (called Cocktails) opened when the
Underground closed at 201 9th St.  It could be the same place, but I'm not
sure, never having been to the Underground, or Cocktails.

The only other recent Thursday night things I've been to are Osmosis (good
after 1:30 or 2:00) and Terriculous (The End Up, another one coming on 5/28 --
the fist one was fun even with the curfew).  Has anyone been to Freesia?

C. is for candy

Niels:  The alcohol thing -- even though I rag on those drunken straight
fraternity boy things who aren't into this rave concept, alcohol is still a fun
drug.  Nothing like getting buzzed with a few drinks and bouncing around the
dance floor.  Whee!  Quartknee once explained to me that X is a mind-expanding
drug and that alcohol was a mind-closing drug.  I concur.  Expanding on the
concept, pot would be mind-focusing and acid mind-sensitizing?  Nitrous
mind-reverberating and ethyl ether mind-blurring?  It's just a matter of
choosing a drug for the evening.  Should I have red wine or white?  It's only
when another person's choice of drug affects my experience at a rave in a
negative way that I start to get peeved.

D. is for dalmations -- 101 of them

Where's everyone going this weekend?  We have a full slate of offerings. 
Anyone want to try to meet up at any of them?  Actually after looking back at
the list(s), I take that back!  Everything seems to be going on in LA!  Bummer.
Is Immersion just going to be 8.0 with a different name?

I hope this wasn't too long and rambling for y'all!

Share and enjoy,

Tim

the posters are out - so it's confirmed - Robert Anton Wilson speaking,

new book, _Reality_Is_What_You_Can_Get_Away_With_.  415 267 1837 for 
info
on this and other happenings.

also confirmed is the party in GG Park (marx meadow) this coming monday
25 may, noon to sundown.

finally, if anybody is planning to fly to LA this weekend for the gilligan's
festivities, i hear that most of the SF participants (DJs &c.) will be going
down on Delta flight #1223 departing noon on friday, or the same flight on
saturday.  the crowd plans to return to SF on Delta #442 leaving 4pm on sunday.

see you at the park....

	Not that I like to add to the bandwidth here, but Tim brings up
a very perceptive point:

>Just an idea. Not that it sounded like Brian was on X or anything! :-)

Actually, I did have a small amount of a particular substance, far less than
I would estimate that most people at raves who do stuff take (It wasn't X
or LSD), and all it gave me was tremendous energy and a slight dizzy
feeling. The stuff I mentioned in my review were things I had hoped would
not be affected by my physical state, things like I thought the music _was_
good, that there was too much light, but that the layout of the place was
pretty cool. I don't think any of those would be influenced by the fact that
I could run up the stairs without even raising my heart rate or even beginning
to sweat. I certainly wasn't hallucinating all the other sfravers there. :)
Oh, I forgot to mention last time that there was a lot of fog provided by a
fog machine above the dance floor without an off button. I thought it was
cool - it adds to the experience, definitely, and I that was the first
effective fog machine I've seen at a rave up here...
	Anyway, Tim's point is great. Remember, you do get out of a rave
(to a certain extent) what you put into it. If you curl up into a ball in the
corner, poeple aren't going to be as friendly as if you dance, walk around,
smile, etc. On the other hand, I think we've all been to a rave that could
be in no uncertain terms called BAD (Lunacy comes to mind...)

most of these charges have been filed by the Church Of Scientology
which has a vested interest in seeing Prozac banned.  the major
problem with these charges is that the Prozac was being administered
to suicidal and/or violent psychotic types to cure them of their
anti-social tendencies in the first place!  So, hardly surprising that
if it didn't work, these already-sick people would continue along
their previous lines.

i probably wouldn't go around `experimenting' with Prozac anyway.
just like i wouldn't use thorazine to get off an LSD trip...

as for the rest of the Rat Investigation - dead brilliant!  i propose
we adopt Algernon IX as the official SF Raves Mascot.

I agree.  Very few drinkers stop at just a light buzz though, they
usually seem compelled to go on.  I went to FX once when Rick Preston
was spinning, had a beer or two and hit that floor.  It was amazing.
My only regret is that they made him play Modern Rock shit too soon.
Emptied the floor like that.  Of course, that's what club owners like
to see...

>Expanding on the concept, pot would be mind-focusing and acid
>mind-sensitizing?

i don't know that i'd call pot mind-focusing.  while it is easier to
focus on some things, it takes an awful lot of effort to do it!  i
particularly like mixing music after having a joint - it's real easy
to set the proper levels.  acid is just plain old mind-expanding in
every sense of the word.

i hate fog machines.  i didn't like it at this event.  personal
preference, i guess.  here's my Rave Review Card for last saturday's
Sharon anyway, in case anybody cares:

music: A (DJ Spun was most impressive)

As someone else mentioned, the former Underground is now a gay bar called
Cocktails.  On Mondays it is Krash Klub, which is that dark and scary
industrial/techno that not many on this list seem to go for.  There tends
to be an interesting blend of people there.

The bar itself has pool/pinball upstairs, and looks like a 'typical' bar.
Downstairs is another bar w/ dancefloor etc.  Not much in the way of decor;
but they'll probably bring in lasers etc.  I happen to love the place
because it brings back memories of the old Underground; your mileage may vary.

Status: R


I heard that the rave scene in Belgium was going on
about a year and a half ago.  A friend of mine who lived there and
enjoyed the rave scene there, predicts Leige is gonna b one of the
hotter rave places in Europe soon.  There are a few house mixers
who come from Leige whose music is now gracing the teckno house vinyl even
here in SF. 

If house is what you like Leige may be it.  I heard the rave scene is
dying or dead in many of the bigger cities across Europe.  But there
still is a scene in Belgium, and Berlin and some other cities.  I
heard Barcelona has real potential for an acid house explosion.

rave, pave, gave, fave, cave, save, wave,

(yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
it's gonna be a fun busy weekend... so many raves.. what to do... what

 Hay Ho, Ravers!
	 I just got word that I must take an extended leave of absence from the
 Bay area to visit Leige, Belgium for a month or two.  I'm wondering....
 Does anybody know what the rave scene is like over there?  I recently visited 
 New Orleans and Atlanta and there was nobody who even recognized the word 
RAVE!
 I really cannot go through this again.  Summboddi pleeez hep mi!
	 I won't be going until Fall 92.  So, even if there is no word now, keep
 an ear open and post what U noe!  Mykl G!  I cn't believe I didn't see you at 
 the DNA lounge!  I was wearing my SFR button.(On my tank top which was 
wrapped 
 around my waist!)  You should have com down to the dance floor!  I danced so 
 hard there and then at the picnic that my butt was sore for the next two days!
 YIPES!

RAVES GOING ON THIS WEEKEND IN LA THAT ARE FREE FOR SF'ers

If you have an ID that says you are from up north (driver's license is best,
but try your school ID's or anything that would say you live up north)
then you can get in free to 3 Parties, 1 Rave, 1 BBQ
The first 'party' is a pre-party that starts at 9 PM tonite
and is at .. dammit i lost the address
but the nbr to call is 415-574-8177
i think its at 836 N Hollywood, or something, right off Melrose
that ends at 3 AM, but MORE ( a pretty hot after party around here) starts
at 3 AM and is in the same place, and you can stay if you were there before
that last til about 6 or 7 AM, so it is basically from 9 PM to 6 AM
(sounds kinda like a rave ...) 

IF you dont have ID's then bring cans of food and they will give you a discount

Then on Saturday, there will be United Nations Under Sound
with Jeno, Garth and Ernie Munson
(and a WHOLE bunch of others)
thats free again for SF'ers and discounted with food from LA types

3 AM Saturday/Sunday is Flammable Liquid, the hottest damn
underground after party there is and that is also Free/Discount for SF/LA
the number for that isnt out yet though

On sunday from 9 to 5 (???) there is sketch Pad, another club type thing
and also a BBQ at the 'Bat House' that is BYOLL (Bring your own love lunch)

so basically its a good weekend to come down and visit,
once you get down here the numbers to call are 

213-960-7815
310-784-5665

cool

That is the question.  Hmmm...

there is going to be a United Nations Under Sound *** S.F. Love L.A. Tour Rave
in L.A. which will feature Northern Cal DJs Jeno, Garth, and Ernie.  But after 
having spoken to someone who had just spoken to Ernie (Here we go again...) I
hear that these guys are planning to go to Gilligan's 2.  Have I not been 
paying enough attention annd not noticed that these two events are the same or
is there some mix-up in the works?  I'd like to know soon as I am hitting the 
road tomorrow from Davis for L.A.
	Brian, you said that you were headed for Gilligan's 2.  Watts Up with

I'm goin to Immersion to check out the Italian astrophysist and her
space-techno stuff.  I think the rest of the night's line up is like the
Delirium Incident tonite.  (so last-minute warnings tom'w could change my 
mind).
Don't know if it'll be like 8.0, maybe a bit like Cyber Spyder if the
performances attract the uninitiated......  

But I'm not aware of viable alternatives on Friday.  What about the rumored 
two day Floppy aniversary on Sat./Sun. nite?  I've also heard vaguely
of an underground thing on Satuday in SF; ask for rumors at Zanzibar.

So I'll wear ye olde suspenders and SFR button and see in the park on Monday
who I don't see @ Immersion on Friday.

P.S.  Marie and Steve are here from TX for the weekend, for those of
you who know them  (jai, &c.)

Subject: Sound Traffic Control
Status: R

Delirium Incident last night at 177 Townsend was definitely a "mixed
bag".  For starters, Cheb I Sabbah (half the reason I attended) played
everything *but* the Northern African / Middle Eastern dance music he's
best known for, instead spinning ambient but extremely grating noise
mixed with some bizarre vocal rantings.  The visuals, primarily distorted
video, were nightmarish in nature, reminding one more of ReSearch magazine
than the normal rave psyche-doodling.

Then "Mondo Vanilli" came on (indeed, R. U. "Ken" Sirius).  My expectations
were as low as possible for this segment, but were in fact higher than
the actual performance.  This was, if not a sick parody of multi-media
performance art, at best an extremely lame attempt at the genre, one that
would flunk a freshman course at S.F. State.  There were a couple of
dancers, one topless hugging a T.V., both splattered in fake blood, one
with something resembling a babies head in the state of half-birth.  The
"climax" of the set was a cover version of "I Am the Walrus" as Mr.
Sirius might have imagined DEVO would have done it in 1977.  I tend to
like performance art, but this was totally pointless and witless.

Fortunately, Sound Traffic Control managed to redeem the evening for me.
Warning:  I'm into "serious" electronic music and performance, and there
was a large element of that involved, but also a tribal element, with
Tim North's Hoverdrum (an instrument / sculpture consisting of a drum
set suspended from the air with lots of complex mechanical couplings,
with these couplings apparently amplified to produce strange resonances
along with the drumming), Stephen Kent's excellent Digeridoo segment
with Beth Custer on sax and Tim North again on drums, and a brilliant
finale with six drummers jamming hard (I was reminded of the Dead Can
Dance show a couple of years ago).  Also, Barry Schwartz "played" his
two extremely interesting sound sculptures, one of which resembles
an oversized turntable with the "record" being a disk of sheet metal
(some cymbal-like alloy) about ten feet in diameter, with a strange metallic
"pick-up" with a chunk of dry-ice attached.  The sounds produced were
screeching but quite rich and complex -- I'd not heard anything like it
before.  I won't try to describe his other contraption (a hybrid harp /
tesla coil?) but it was equally interesting.  On top of it all was
Naut Humon (from Rhythm and Noise) mixed, directed the image of the
sound in 3D, and adding his samples and synthesized textures.

All in all, if you're thinking this might appeal to you, check it
out yourself tonight, again at 177 Townsend.  Fortunately, Mondo
Vanilli won't be there, and Dr. Fiorella Terenzi's "Music of the
Galaxies" could only be a tremendous improvement.

The rave that followed looked and sounded promising, but after about
1/2 hour we had to call it a night.

Hi everyone!

Osmosis last night was pretty good, as usual, a bit less populated
(maybe due to Delirium?).  Energy was good, the music was pretty good
(mostly house and disco-house), not a whole lot of community tho.
I guess it's the second-to-last Osmosis; they were passing out the
following flyer:

Wow.

I still haven't been to many raves, and none of them very underground
(including this one, I assume), so I was pretty impressed by The
Delirium Incident at 177 Townsend last night.  There was no problem
getting in as was feared by those who said it was a closed party or
required an invite.  Sound Traffic Control was very cool, IMHO.  They
make a bunch of cool sounds with an wide variety of sometimes very
unusual instruments (like a big metal disk and dry ice).  It's really a
spectacle.  The drum equipment was suspended in the air by bungee
cords.  The drummer just cruzed up and played in mid-air.

Mondo 2000 has some connection with this event, *and* they were giving
out free copies of issues 5 and 6 of their magazine!  I got a copy of
issue 5, and forgot to get issue 6.  They were really friendly about
giving them out (party favors).  Anyone want to pick up issue 6 for me
tonight? :-)  I guess I should be able to buy one somewhere?

Sound Traffic Control (STC) played from about 11:45 to 1.  Then DJ's
started playing some great music.  We needed to get going so we could
work the next day, but it was hard not to dance to the music.  I'm not
expert enough to classify or rate the music, I just know I really liked
it.

And, the attitude thing was really true in my case.  I was very psyched
the whole drive up from the South Bay, and had a great time throughout,
only assisted by a smart drink.  Pretty good smart drinks there too.

And now for the good news.  From the flyer I got, it looks like STC
will be there again tonight.  I guess the event called "Immersion"
tonight.  I would advise going just to see the "band" if you haven't
seen something like that before.  I'll include the info from the weekly
calendar at the end for convenience.

I saw one SFR button last night, but didn't have a chance to introduce
myself at the time, and never saw her again the rest of the night, or
any other buttons.  The button I saw was at around 10:30, before STC
started up.  So, who was it???  And, how can we get more buttons out,
or should we have some other way of identifying one another in absense
of buttons.  Like we could stand, walk, and dance around holding our
thumb and middle fingers together?

Flyers for Life Force and Creation both already in Vitamin B's list, as
well as another one or two I missed.

i dont know about what's going on except what i hear on the phone
the Love FOundation tour has NOTHING to do with Gilligan's and they
have emphasized this quite frequently

it is possible for them all to be doing both gigs depending on how they do it
but i really dont know what is going on

Gilligan's will be 24 hours of fun if you can last
and the 4 party, 1 rave, and 1 BBQ will  be cool to go to cuz they are
free, 

no matter what you do this weekend, i hope you have a raving good time

Wow, looks like I lucked out - I left for about 1 1/2 hrs at 10:40 and
managed to miss the parts MykL liked least, and caught the best part.
I guess that helped my opinion of Delirium Incident, although I think I
would have rather seen these acts even if they weren't that great.  Oh
well.

A little additional info on the dangers of Prozac, responding to this message:

I agree with Niels Mayer that you should be extremely careful before taking
Prozac; however, the reports about Prozac being unsafe need to be put in
context.  

Millions of people take Prozac; it's currently the most popular
antidepressant.  What a lot of people find, after taking it for three to four
weeks solid, is that they feel more "invigorated" or "enlivened"; their
depression is lifted, and they feel freer to act.  Some of these depressed
people fantasized about murder but would never have acted on those feelings;
on Prozac, some seem to feel less inhibited.  In nearly all of the cases put
before the FDA, the individuals committed violent acts after being on Prozac
continuously for at least a month, which is the period of time needed to get
the antidepressant/therapeutic effect.  

I asked one doctor about Prozac, and he indicated that Prozac is relatively
safe.  He was concerned about the media's desire to ring the alarm about
Killer Drugs.  When people commit violent crimes, being on a medication can be
an easy excuse, both psychologically and legally.

That doesn't mean you should take Prozac.  I recommend that people go to their
local library and use the information to make an intelligent decision for
themselves.  (People actually learning and deciding for themselves?  My God!
What would the DEA and the FDA think???  They must hate the fact that people
are (sometimes) more difficult to control than their lab rats.)  There's an
excellent private medical library at Stanford Shopping Mall that has in its
files, along with other things, a preliminary study that found that about a
third of Stanford undergrads have at least tried ecstacy.

The alt.drugs FAQ about ecstacy is also a good source of information.  


Anyway, I look forward to seeing some of you at events this weekend...

could someone post where (e.g. east/west) marx
meadow is ?  I know, I should have a map, ask
a librarian, consult with the collective 
unconscious, but then, isn't that what I'm 
doing by mailing sfraves ?

I think so.

So, if you imagine the park as a rectangle,
and let the x axis be 50 units, the y
axis be 10 units (rough, rough estimates)
then what's the approx. coordinates of
marx meadow ?

or, if you can figure out a better way
to describe it to a numbskull like moi,
please feel free to describe 
"the location of marx meadow" in
any language/media/set of symbols/
shakespeare's sonnets/any descriptive
tool you know of, please.

thank you for your support.

Still, (OK enough typographic cutEnEss!) it's possible to say that
a given event (say, Rave for Peace) is more successful than average
in the degree of positivity and interaction shown by the participants
on the whole.  And others less successful (witness Freesia last
Thursday).

That's not to say a mediocre rave can't be improved by our emitting
positivity, but odds are it will not instantly turn into a great rave.

Probably the subjective component is the most important of all.
If I find myself not in the best of spirits, tired, not succeeding
in spreading positive energy, chances are I'm going to perceive
the rave as mediocre, even if others around me are having a great
time.

Subject: Townsend/Vanilli
Status: RO

I couldn't make it until 2:30 am after dashing in from the last Grateful
Dead show at Sacramento (a good one, too).  Nothing like an eclectic
musical evening.  So I missed the aforementioned highs and lows of the
Mondo Vanilli presentation and so on.  Since I'm generally able to
observe the scene only at a distance from Portland it was an interesting
experience nonetheless.  

Things were at a good level when I came in -- good lights, massive sound,
interesting Video Toaster projections.  The dance floor was reasonably
busy most of the time with a house/techno slant to things.  I'm not real
big on the deep stuff, but it was fine for dancing.  Had to leave at 4:15
but I came away feeling quite refreshed.  The scene has evolved incredibly
since my last forays into it last fall, but I definitely came away feeling
that the regular club thing is just not all that satisfying, even at
Townsend which has plenty of space and a real low-key approach.

They said things would continue until 8 . . .

The cards I found included ones for Mystic Groove, Blow Your Head/Toontown,
Life Force and a really nice one for Creation at the Russian River next
weekend.  I'd like to try the smart cotton candy, but I'm going to be in
Las Vegas next weekend (for even more Dead shows).  Yesterday at Sacramento
they were handing out flyers for something happening at the Aladdin Hotel
next Friday night, I believe.  If I can get more info from the number
I'll post it here -- it was being billed as a rave but that seems to mean
just about anything now.

OK, here's another one:

George's Memorial Birthday Acid House Rave
  Saturday, May 23
  9 pm to 9 am
  Jack London Club (Oakland Riviera)
  the address looks like 1300 E. 8th
  off 880 south take 16th ave exit and take every left
  off 880 north take 5th ave exit and take every left except back to freeway
  DJs -- bands -- surprises -- food
  bus schedule -- $3 -- 9:30 pm Reckless Records, 1401 Haight/Masonic
                        11:30 pm Brainwash, 1122 Folsom/11th
                        2:00 am Zanzibar, 842 Valencia
  LOST - dial 436-9149
  info - 510/436-6868

could be interesting

Hope to meet some sfravers while I'm in town for some rest and rave-action

" That's not to say a mediocre rave can't be improved by our emitting
" positivity, but odds are it will not instantly turn into a great rave.

  However I must point out I notice a very direct relationship to my
participation in a dancing place and its response to me.  If I come in
to a room full of active people and sit down to stare at them, I
perceive that the activity dies down immediately from that point
onward.  If I then get up and start dancing with my own energy, my own
creativity, I perceive that the activity picks up immediately from
that point onward.
  (I have gone as far as analyzing for fakeness and weirdo factors: I
perceive that if other people may think of me as a quark, weirdo,
not-in-sync person than their actions will not follow mine as much as
try to go the opposite way; this is rare though (thank god!).)

  All this stuff is so consistent that I use it as a way to control
the mood of the floor (at least in my own eyes (see below) (what does
it really matter to me whether it's real or not?)) -- and the strange
thing is, it seems to work!
  Is it just me, or is there really a large component of control I
have over a crowd?

  I think it is a combination of the two: the impact I have on the
crowd (while wild in concept I believe a true thing) and my own
perceptions seeing more of what I'm doing than a "flat response" of
what is actually out there (uh, what's the term ...  objective, that's
it).

" Probably the subjective component is the most important of all.  If
" I find myself not in the best of spirits, tired, not succeeding in
" spreading positive energy, chances are I'm going to perceive the
" rave as mediocre, even if others around me are having a great time.

This must be it -- I read your PP here after responding to the above.
I concur.

" As John Lennon would say, "it's all in the mind, you know!"

Yes, yes, it is.

Now, what supports the mind?  That is the question.  (I know some
answers -- the mind itself; food, air & other physiological intakes
(X); physical stimuli (touch, feel, emotional things) ...)

      Not to be a dick or anything, but I see nothing underground about
raves advertised in newspapers, tickets sold at music chains, $20 ticket
prices, ravesters that go to frat formals and Grateful Boring shows.  The
Seattle scene is much smaller and is mostly illegal but we have a rave or
two every weekend and very little frat boys, hippies, jocks, or people that 
ruin the rave eXperience go to.  They are big enough that there is cool
stuff and lights, but not completely overcrowded and rarley busted by the
pigs. Usually good music too. And we almost always but the tickets at the
door, so we are not ripped off (like I here happens in California).  Well,
that is my Seattle Rave plug.  Tonight's rave is at 7th and Stacey (head
South on 6th one block past Lander and take a left). Bouncing room, smart
bar, and acid art, be there or be square.   BTW, how much does X run in
California??? Here its $15-$20 before the rave, $25-$30 a hit at the rave
(which I think is a total rip off, cause 5 or 6 years ago it was like
$6-$8 in clubs).---------------------------------dan

Well, I guess we're not in Seattle are we?

I'm sure everyone here would rather remove the commercial edge from
some of the local raves.  I know I'm one.  But I've had a good time at
the few raves I've been to so far.  I go with people I like, try and 
keep a positive attitude, enjoy what there is to enjoy, and, if I'm 
lucky, perhaps meet another person that I'll know for a long time.

Though I've just tuned into the sfravers in the last two weeks, it seems
like you people are committed to trying to keep the right kind of 
feeling alive in the rave scene.  I hope I get to meet a couple of y'all--
and if you don't mind, attend your next Full Moon Rave.  Sounds like fun.

To the future!

If you really do want me to do it, I can, I just don't want to be
taking over (esp. since I didn't ask to.)

Perhaps encouraging everyone to post flyers to the list rather than
mail them to you would solve things for everyone -- except those
people who want to subscribe fully and get only a couple of messages a
day (which is impossible).  That way everyone sees everything
immediately, and knows what has already been communicated or not.

Thanks a million,

Nope, this wasn't there either.  Not only that, we had to beg for admission
after they had closed the doors on about two hundred people (they weren't even
close to being full), but finally got in after the doors were rushed.  The
DJ's sucked, and the cops kept stopping the music for no apparent reason at
all ("If you're driving don't drink, if you aren't have fun").  What a load of
shit.

Thanks to Vitamin B for driving me 120 miles to see Gilligan's 2.  However, for
a $35 price, I was expecting a free massage with a buffet.  What we got was a
pathetically empty fairground room with nice video.  Did United Nations Under
Sound happen?  We got to the map point and someone told us that Doc had 
been
shot, true?

pete ashdown writes that ali baba's, sam i am and gilligan's 2 were
all pathetic let-downs.  once again proving that SF is really the Rave
Capital.  although, actually, this weekend wasn't so wonderful for me
either.

first, we went to Blow Your Head at the back room of Townsend - I was
particularly psyched to hear Rick Preston and Markie Mark spinning
again.  Of course, we completely missed Rick's set - got there just as
he was leaving for the event at Big Heart City whose name totally
escapes me.  We hung out at BYH for a bit.  I wasn't impressed.
Whereas Townsend proper has an incredible floor, sound system and
lighting rig, the back room is just an empty concrete space with
dreadful acoustics.  It was too brightly lit as well - I *like* to see
who I'm dancing next to, but there is such as thing as too bright.
the visuals were pretty cool, and we helped one of the lighting guys
move his junk in so we got in for free.

after about an hour of being pummeled by the sound system and rather
incompetent DJ, we decided to check out big heart city.  it was only
$5 to get in, and the sounds and lights were much better.  BHC has a
smoke machine that they like to run near-continuously.  fortunately,
they had a laser in and it made the smoke machine useful rather than
annoying.  the crowd was small but dedicated.  we decided that we
valued being with our friends more than being at a better equipped
space, so we headed back to Blow Your Head after a little while.

we remained at BYH for the rest of the evening.  markie mark played a
(typically) phenomenal set early in the AM.  i don't know where he
gets his records from, but i want some!!  very energetic, bouncy
stuff, that seems to just get more and more intense the longer he's
spinning.  what a talent.  anyway, despite the shit sound system, we
hung out until the early morning rays shone in and showed us exactly
how grungy the whole place was.

not one of the best raves i've been to, but reasonably entertaining,
and the free admission certainly meant i got my money's worth.

Not to defend ToonTown, but they've only done that twice as far as I know,

Most raves here are $5 or at most $10. The big ones are higher (which seems

Who talked about going to frat formals? I talked about DJ'ing a dorm

One of the best things about the rave scene here is how much fun it is to go
dancing with a big group of friendly people who arent hung up on rules and
categories.  There is a feeling of tolerance and unity and fun at the best
raves.  Nobody is hung up on what the other ravers do when they're not
partying, worrying about who is a REAL raver and who is just an imposter.
I'm happy to see anyone at a rave who's never been there before if they are
there to have fun.  Including hippies, including jocks, including anybody
who isnt there to wreck things.  I'd rather party with a bunch of people
that I dont know who are there to have fun than familiar people who are
sullen and determined to find fault.  I dont think that $20 is reasonable, I
wouldnt go to a club that sells tix at BASS or Tower [unless I was on the
list :-)], but there is definitely fun to be had even at these events with
good music and a little positivity.  Lighten up, Dan, it ain't the punk
scene.  If you think hippies don't know how to party, all I can say is you
must not know any real hippies.

see you in the future...

Brief review of Immersion, Friday 5-22 at 177 Townsend


Fiorella and her astral friends were A-OK by me.  What she did was
basically some new-age synth noodling over a background of ambient sounds.
These sounds were a little hard to describe; kind of mineral in nature;
swelling and falling low frequency drones with rougher, gravelly sounds on
top of them. Plus mutli-screen computer graphics, some of which were abstract
and some were pretty pictures of outer space.  It was more or less what
an 8 year old nerd would imagine an LSD experience to look adn sound like.

Sound Trafffic Control was as described by Mykl G on Thursday night exceptj
that they didn't play as long :-(   It was about the best sound quality
I've ever heard in a club.

The rave part of the night was not the most energetic.  Too many of the 
people there had come to consume art rather than to participate in a celebration.
But that's just a nuance.  The music was an execellent selection of acid and
deep house; after 4am or so I was actually hungry for techno.  Great chill
room with geological low-pitch brain-programming sounds and UV light and 
mandala-ish projections on the walls.

I guess it added up to the "Thinking Fellers' Rave".  Lots of SFR types in
attendance; glad I met you Joel and Rox!!

>Well, the weekend wasn't a complete loss.  I did get to meet Spike Lee ;-).

So, Pete, sounds like there's a story in there...  Was he out raving?  And not
to be outdone  :^), I saw David Bowie and Iman wandering Haight Street a few
weeks ago.  It would have been cool to see them at a rave!

I went to Blow Your Head on Saturday and had a good time.  Not a great time,
but definitely a good time.  It could have had a better space, better lighting,
better acoustics, but it was a fun crowd and good music, IMHO.

But the park on Monday was by far the best Memorial Day I've ever had!  Even
better than Preston's first park rave a month ago.  Good music all around (some
of it got a bit too hard techno-ish for a sunny, happy afternoon and some of
Markie Marks disco-ish house turned me off) but all around good.  And Roger
Sanchez's set was killer!  (Roger mixes a lot of the tracks from the Strictly
Rhythm label.)

Fun crowd, some people lounging and watching; others dancing or playing 
games.
Great space -- nicely enclosed.  I was in an excellent mood and had a dozen
good friends there with me, plus the friendly sfrave faces!  I even got a date
with a cute boy named Dan!  :->

So, all in all, I had a fun weekend.  Glad I didn't go to LA.  I hope Preston
keeps this up.  Was he passing the hat to help defray the costs -- if not, next
time I'll have to search him out to help.

Share and enjoy,

Tim

Cool. Sounds like a good reason for staying in Oaktown on Sat Jun 6... 

 ... Cuz there's also the "Festival At the Lake" in Lake Meritt, Oakland
Fri Jun 5 thru Sun Jun 7. Past ones I've gone to have been quite fun w/
good live music (not techno, but decent live funk, blues, soul, african,
reggae, rap, etc). 

If you find out more specifics w/r/t time/location, let us know.

PS: a nice "ambient-houseish" version of Nusrat's music can be found in
Massive Attack's remix of his song "Mustt Mustt." (sp?).

Stompy Productions' (Preston's) next park event is scheduled for sunday 07 june
(also the date of the haight street fair).   despite the lack of nifty lighting
and visuals, i've decided that outdoor dancing is my favorite.  ah, to be able
to take deep breaths of cool, smoke-free air!  after party on the 7th (after
sundown) at harrison & 3rd.

>Well, the weekend wasn't a complete loss.  I did get to meet Spike Lee ;-).

So, Pete, sounds like there's a story in there...  Was he out raving?  And not
to be outdone  :^), I saw David Bowie and Iman wandering Haight Street a few
weeks ago.  It would have been cool to see them at a rave!

I went to Blow Your Head on Saturday and had a good time.  Not a great time,
but definitely a good time.  It could have had a better space, better lighting,
better acoustics, but it was a fun crowd and good music, IMHO.

But the park on Monday was by far the best Memorial Day I've ever had!  Even
better than Preston's first park rave a month ago.  Good music all around (some
of it got a bit too hard techno-ish for a sunny, happy afternoon and some of
Markie Marks disco-ish house turned me off) but all around good.  And Roger
Sanchez's set was killer!  (Roger mixes a lot of the tracks from the Strictly
Rhythm label.)

Fun crowd, some people lounging and watching; others dancing or playing 
games.
Great space -- nicely enclosed.  I was in an excellent mood and had a dozen
good friends there with me, plus the friendly sfrave faces!  I even got a date
with a cute boy named Dan!  :->

So, all in all, I had a fun weekend.  Glad I didn't go to LA.  I hope Preston
keeps this up.  Was he passing the hat to help defray the costs -- if not, next
time I'll have to search him out to help.

Share and enjoy,

Tim

it's called the Buchla Thunder.

there was a neat program for the amiga called mandala - it took video
signal input and chromakeyed it over the image on the screen.  the
image on the screen had certain "hot spots" which triggered midi
events.  so you could paint a drawing of a drum kit on the screen,
then matte yourself over it, and whenever your hand obscured one of
the spots on the screen, it would trigger the corresponding midi
event.  now is that cool or what?

Subject: SOMA article
Status: R


Be on the lookout for a trendy magazine called SOMA.  They are very un-rave-y,
and their latest issue has an article about the rave scene.  I only had time
to skim the article, but it didn't seem to be very broad or well-researched,
and the author definitely wasn't very positive about the whole thing.  (The
secondary title of the article was something like "Smart drinks and acid house:
Just how smart are they?")

They interviewed a few promoters and ravers.  One of the quotes tickled my
fancy a whole bunch: "There's no substance to the music.  It's just loud and
pounding, and the people are the same way."  (This was attributed to Shane
McDaid.  Does anyone know him?)

Who needs `em?  They're a former freebie, gone glossy.
Altogether content-free, advertiser-driven rubbish. Stiff
on the SOMA = Soho legend of '86.  Let them interview club
doormen, sip martinis laced with cocaine, and hang themselves
with a velvet rope for all I care.  An interesting "anit-rave"
article could be written someday, along the lines of (what) will
people learn from rave energy anyway, how can one have worthwhile
conversations at 110 dB's, and whatever happened to other types
of free time.  But if *they* wind up writing it, why, I'll eat
my whistle!

I'm bummed that I missed Fiorella and her spheres - I showed up too
late.  I think I would have enjoyed it even though its been done
before.  John Cage in the 40s wrote Atlas Eclipticalus which is the
visible spectrum of the milky way translated to pitch, and position
translated to timing.

I was at Delirium the night before too (had such a good time I came
back for more) and thought that Sound Traffic control was way better
on Thursday; also liked the music on thursday better; also liked it
a little less crowded on thursday.  Didn't see any SFR buttons on
Friday even though I was looking for them.  Guess I should've worn
my glasses 8)

Maybe directions to the next FMR should be encoded in music so
that you have to decode it to get there.  Maybe not.

Subject: Osmosis was the mostest
Status: R

(enter self-kick mode)

Why on earth did it take me nine months to discover Osmosis???

(end self-kick mode)

This was one of the finer club raves I'd ever been to (prior mood:
average.  total substance intake:  one beer).  The mix of both people and
music was as varied as you could imagine.  Both dance floors (in adjoining
rooms) were well packed with writhing bodies.  The layout of the
third floor at DV8 provides more nooks, crannies, and changes of
scene than any local venue apart from the Jack London Club / Floppy
House.  Maybe the fact that this was the final Osmosis made it better
than the average one, but I was impressed, and left most reluctantly.

I'll post a few new flyers I found there in a bit.

Oh, and I talked to Joel, who is supposedly *the* promoter of Creation
this weekend (formerly a principal of Rave Called Sharon).  I told him
of the bitter disappointment of the last two way-out-of-town raves
(Saratoga Springs and Woodside) and hoped out loud this one would be
different.  He assured me that the Santa Rosa police know about it
and are completely cooperating (?!).  In any case, he confirmed my
hunch that noise (no residents anywhere nearby) and parking (room for
over 2000 cars!) aren't going to be a problem.  He expects between
3 and 4 thousand happy ravers to attend.  Count me in....

Hey Ho!

L.A. over last weekend.  (Dana Watanabe!  Where were YU!)  I was on my way to
Gilligan's 2 (which, by the way, should have been cast away on a desert isle!)
 when I heard that Doc Martin had been shot.  
	What is the word on this?  I was standing on Melrose at the time, 
strangely enough at the pickup point for tickets to... what WAS the name of

Well I'm glad you didn't do a decent flame, because I got lots of positive
feedback, and like I said, I wasn't trying to be a dick, I was just pissed
about the commercialization of the rave scene and to let people know there
is more than just the California scene, our movement is worldwide.

     Someone talked about going to a frat formal the day I posted it, that
was why they were late to the rave.  In Seattle, frat boys are the dicks
that get really drunk and fuck with ravesters and beat people like you and
me up.

    Sorry if I seemed anti-hippy I was trying to point out how 
opposite the Grateful Dead is from TEKKNO.  If your raves have hippies and
you love 'em, that is wonderful.  I'm more into the
lace/leather/bondage/S&M scene and it is represented more up here.

     So who hasn't taken X at a rave, I think raves and X were meant to go
hand in hand. I've only done it at raves about 10 times, but I think it
heightened the eXperience, besides, I was just being cutesy w/ my X's like
many people on da list.
      I was happy for the positive feedback I got, people are pissed about
high ticket prices, being ripped off, and to some extent the crowds, I
think these are legitimate concerns.  I was just wondering what other
people thought.  Just because we love the rave scene doesn't mean it
shouldn't be open to scrutiny, maybe through talking about it we can make
it better.  Lotsa love from the darkside,--------- theravingraven

Oops, I guess all the others must have fallen out,
Oh my...

Went to Feel-X the Cat.
There were a healthy number of friendly sorts there, as well as a thorough
sampling of muscle-headed stumps.  Just as things begin to get cozy and 
comfortable, wouldn't you know it...  Lights everyone!  Move along, move along

...don't worry, the rave just keeps going along in your head til the next

hmm.

I've found it really hard finding good Techno music when I go CD shopping, 
so I'm asking if someone could recommend some really great Techno 
compilations
or artists. I can never get the names of any when I'm raving (obviously)
but I want some Techno songs that are fairly fast and have layers of noises.
:) :) :)

There's a rave in Santa Cruz on May 30th.  It's invitation only however, to
insure no one will wonder into it who doesn't know what a rave is all
about and bring people down.  It's sad to say, but it is a reality.

" ...don't worry, the rave just keeps going along in your head til the

I definately had a lot of fun Friday.  I went eight different places
where I met people here and there -- if I include early Friday morning
and late Friday morning.

The EndUp Thursday evening was very friendly.  Osmosis was really
good.  A Town Hall Meeting was interesting enough, although definately
not rave material.  N Zinga was a necessary change for me at the time
-- Fridays are my tired days.  If I had the money I would have gone to
that big one called Reach Out!, but instead just hung out around all
the different map points -- that was fun!  Then I went to Felix the
Cat, hot and sort of mixed crowd but still fun; Big Heart City was
later than I wanted since an hour went by before they opened, but when
we all got in it was warm and active.  I decided to wander over to 177
Townsend, where I was very happy to dance and listen to Markie Mark
doing very well, and seeing the light system at its best for me to
date.  The End Up Saturday morning was a very nice place to go again,
very varied crowd and sort of talkative once I break down the barriers
of meeting people.  Tonight I stepped in Colossus, stepped out (but
want to go back some day --- just not rave like enough for me I guess)
and then finally right now I'm about to catch the last bit of
Care*Free, if it's possible ... I've had a great time.

Just picked up Instinct Dance, a compilation off the Instinct label. 
Excellent -- Moby (Go and Mobility) and Barracuda are really good, though not
all that fast, but the Brainstorm and Voodoo Child tracks rip.  Have You Seen
My Baby by Voodoo Child especially struck me.

It's really irritating, though, I hear about domestic techno releases and then
no record store around here has ever heard them, or can order them.  Everyone
on alt.rave is going nuts over Digideroo by Aphex Twin, which is domestic,
but I can't find it...  Instinct Dance and Zoo Rave I (which looks like a box
of detergent or something, allegedly good, haven't gotten it yet) are the 
Eon has an album coming out, don't know when, should be domestic, I'm 
definitely getting that...  Also pashdown@javelin.sim.es.com does a lot of
techno reviews, you could ask him for those, or for recommendations.

I'm wondering if anyone has put together a top ten or twenty list
of music stores in the Bay Area to get rave music (I guess since the situation
seems so dismal, these would be stores that had even a few selections).

If people send me suggestions I would create such a thing.  

I'm really pretty new to this sort of thing, but the best store I've
seen so far is Beats Per Minute (BPM) in SF.  

(RAVE MUSIC IS SO EXPENSIVE!!)

Subject: Moscow, Floppy's and going to Townsend late
Status: R

I was thinking this morning how wonderful it would be for Moscow, and
eventually other parts of northeast eurasia to have raves.
While they're going through these hard times, I can see a sort of cultish
thing going on there where raves are really emotionally done well.
In July, Moscow is having a rave (helped out by people from around
here), as well as Japan.

Now, that reminds me of something -- did anyone read the article in
The Bay Guardian, May 13 pg 13 `Pirate Radio'?  It's got a great sense
about it.  It talks about setting up radio stations without getting
the great governmental stamp of approval.  A neat slogan was in the
artical "Think Globally, Broadcast Locally."  There's one local
station in the Mission district called KXXX at around 89.9 FM on
Sundays from 9 to 11 pm, I wonder where else people will set these up?
Anyone want to get one for the Haight area?
  I usually like to stay out of trouble, but the FCC is one beast
which has bothered me ever since I realized they existed -- they
exercise undue control over the content of our lives, as exemplified
in my memory by KQEC, KQED's old sister station which was taken away
from KQED because they aired some real stuff on it.  Now, has FCC been
like KGB and gotten better in recent years, or are they as fascist as
ever still?  I haven't heard much either way.  When I get my own money
I can start to buy my own music, but for now the idea of letting
someone else play me their music which I may find interesting is a
neat idea.  (I already use the Internet and thus have my underground
news needs fulfilled that way.)

I stepped out of my house at 6 this morning, only to find to my dismay
that I had missed a great time at Floppy's ($5 with a great location
across from the CalTrain station -- it was still going when I checked
it out at 7AM but I think I missed the bulk of it).  Care*Free was
hopping slightly when I got there too.  It was fun to run into about
seven people I know this morning -- for me that's making life much
funner, since this is about the first month in my life where I can
roam freely and run into people I know.  It's really fun to make
friends at raves and then see them again and again later.

If I only had an infinite bank account ... (I can manage without, but
lately that's meant I get to go everywhere either by knowing someone
or by showing up really late -- this offers its own kind of
interesting fun moving from place to place, but quite seriously I'd
rather just go and pay a bunch when everyone else is there too).

Well, personally, I like the Techno Trax Series (#2 and #3), and also
there's a rave compilation called TechnoRave: Phase One.  It's on
Invasion Records so it'll be easy to find.

And if you just like fast techno with lots o' noize, check out Lords
of Acid!  ;-)

I'll see if I can track down a DJ or two and get their top-20's from them,
maybe once every two weeks or something. Also, there's a lot of techno
talk on the manchester list (manchester-request@irss.njit.edu), and as 
someone has pointed out, pashdown@javelin.sim.es.com has a fairly large
collection of reviews he's done. (Sorry Pete :)  

As far as record stores in SF, I asked a very similar question about 2 
months ago on the list, and all four people who replied said BPM was
the best. I'd have to concur, and maybe add Star Records (I forget the
address) and maybe Butch Wax. On the East Bay, surprisingly enough
Leopold's in Berkeley has a fairly large selection of popular techno
12"'s and CD's (if you get there before I do, he he he:) Rasputin's gets
semi-decent CD's and domestic 12"'s, but the Tower in Berkeley sucks
(but according to miss silverio the Tower in Mountain View has a good
selection). 

There are also a lot of good techno compilations coming out domestic, too
(although they may have somewhat dated music). For $14 at most stores, 
there's
Techno-Rave Vol's 1,2,3
Zoo Rave (the detergent-box look-alike)
Techno Vol. 1
Only for the Headstrong (recommended!)
Instinct Dance 
Guerilla Grooves (more rub-a-dub-ish, but still cool)
Best of STR (harder to find, but has some cool stuff) vol's 1,2

There are some great techno compilations on import; the stores montioned
above would probably carry these, though the chain stores would probably be
better stocked than the DJ-only stores (DJ's, "real" DJ's, seem to have a
phobia about vinyl - I'm going to start buying my singles on vinyl but
still buy the compilations on CD) These import goodies are:

Give Peace a Dance (Vol 3 is GREAT, Vol. 2 is great but entirely ambient, 1's Pok)
Serious Beats Vol. 1-4 (3 & 4 are double-discs; 2 is great, 1 is pretty goodm
		3 & 4 have a lot of good stuff but they've been shortened)

Breaks, Bass, & Bleeps Vol's 1-4 (very good series, primarily if you like
	Kraftwerk-derived fast techno.)

Techno Trax Vol's 1-4 (Highly recommended series, except for 1. If you could
	only buy a few compilations, get these)

1000 Ohm!, 2000 Ohm! - Harder, more abrasive techno, perhaps a bit slower
	than most, but at +6 it sounds great! Lotsa good acidic head-trip 
	sounding stuff.

Techno-Rave! Vol 1, 2 (These are both 2-disc sets, have a more acidic flavor)

Champion Sounds - best of Kickin' (Consistently great, fast stuff - from 
	Messiah's "There Is No Law" to "Xeroxed" by Zero Zero. Very gooood)

Chaos Theory Vol. 1 & 2 (The first half of Vol. 1 is pretty good, and Vol.
	2 is a lot of break-beat Prodigy-sounding stuff (I like))

XL Recordings - Vol's 1,2,3 (avoid 1, 2's killer, 3's again in the break-beat
	house vein)

Finally, there are the "DJ-only" remix services, who issue both CD's and
vinyl:

Art of Mix (going alphabetically here) - remixed for long intros and outtros,
	their ravey stuff begins on Vol. 7 and 8 (but avoid 9, and stuff before
	these are much more "post-modern/alternative") (CD's, I'm talking about
	here). 

Razormaid - bleah! They used to be somewhat decent, somewhat acidic (their 
mix
	of "Turn On" by Psychic TV is GREAT, and RM-CD-A1, -R@, and Z-3 were
	great, too.), but their recent stuff has been s-h-i-t. They're starting
	a new line, called Seismic Sound, which looks (according to a future
	track listing) promising, but their mix of Egma's "Let the Bass Kick"
	sucked. Avoid until further notice. (Sorry Joseph!)

Twitch - Really, really great stuff. Vinyl: Anything Vol. 3 and later is very
	ravey, as is CD 2 (CD 3 is being pressed as we speak). The prices compare
	to import CD and vinyl compilation prices. Contact sybase!mw@sun.com
	for more info. (Hi Mike! Hope ya don't mind). Superior mixes, by the
	way, great for both DJ's and the ordinary home listener....


Phew! That's about all I have time for. I didn't really expect say so much...
sorry if it sounds haphazard. Write me if you want more info about the above.

	Brian

p.s. - anybody out there with a .com domain in the East Bay area need a hard-
working Berkeley sophomore CS major for a part-time (20 hrs/week) job? I
need something to help pay for the music... and I'd like to get work experience
in the CS field. I have too much spare time for my own good. Do I really need
to be reading all 264 articles in alt.religion.kibology? I didn't think so...

Maybe because it isn't domestic.  When I was at Prime Cuts last week, they had
about 20 copies in though.

I think the Eon album has been delayed until the end of June.

Please post this info to the list.  Also a cheap place to find the new Denon
CD deck would be appreciated.

Yeah,
	Go in and ask for Mellissa, she's a manager in the tape dept
and she's also a raver (we carpooled to CrEation). She's trying hard to
get more rave/techno/house music in the store.

Actually, his most easily recognizable contributions to modern pop culture
are the names "Justified Ancients of Mumu" and "KLF", which were both taken
from the Illuminatus books.

My favorite records stores in the Bay Area:

1) Star Records (Hayes Street, SF).  Well-stocked!

2) BPM Music Factory (Polk Street, SF).  Has the latest imports.

3) Leopold's (Berkeley).  Closer for east-bay people for import 12".
	Limited selection.

4) Amoeba (Berkeley).  Good for import CDs and used 12".

5) Record Rack, Butch Wax (18th St, SF).  Not as popular as Star and
	BPM, but they have stuff you might not find elsewhere for
	12".

Oh yah, I keep meaning to ask:  What do the sfr buttons look like?  Those of
us whoe don't have, (probably) don't know what to look for.  Every time I see
a button at a rave I try to inconspicuosly dance around the person to see what
their button looks like!  We should make more and make them in fluorecent
colors so that they stand out in black light and distribute to the rest of us.
