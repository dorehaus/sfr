geez i am beginning to like john paul II....he has put out a best selling 
book and now a cd of the rosary!!!! rock!!!

found in the worst daily newspaper in the country the sf chronicle...

in the great traditon of those crazy chanting monks soon to be heard at 
raves everywhere (and its an import too!)...

POPE'S HIT RECORD OF ROSARY IS COMING TO ENGLAND

      Pope John Paul II has a hit record on his hands.

     The double CD has gone platinum in Europe, and now a British 
recording company is hoping that is will top the charts in England.

     "We're hoping for a miracle," said a spokeswoman for the recording 
company Telstar.  "We think it will be the Christmas No. 1.

     The pope recites the rosary in Latin on one disc of the two-CD set, 
while on the other, an Irish priest, Father Colm Kilcoyne, recites his 
English version of a prayer dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

     The pope's contribution was actualy recorded 15 years ago but only 
recently released on CD.

     Earlier this year, Benedictine monks from Spain dominated the pop 
chants with their collection of 10th century chants, Canto Gregoriano.

Yeah, I really like the "Aphex Twins" remix of the pope singing "Don't
Chu Love Me Baby" unto the infant Jesus. This will be a sure-fire X-mas
season hit, tugging at the heart-strings of all that dare listen.

His new rendition of the old club hit "Sex Dwarf" (Sex Dwarf, isn't it
nice, bringing disco virgins to a life of vice) is immaculate both in
conception and execution. However, the message behind the song is quite
shocking as it portrays God roaming shirtless through club-land, with
his long white beard flowing over glistening pectoral musculature,
frantically asking every young virgin on the dancefloor "Are you on X?".

check out the red and white stovepipe hat on the first frame!

i still get a kick out of the actors on that show; it seems they
  are cast about 10 years younger than they actually are...
btw isn't the fat guy in the first frame play one of the doofuses in
   the power rangers???

everytime i'm about to give up completely on Fox, along comes a 
 new killer cartoon! i think that's their one and only saving grace
  (i confess, i'm an Animaniac junkie!)

I'm sorry i get so damn jumpy whenever someone makes the slightest
dig on LA, but i'm kinda touchy aobut the subject in case you couldnt tell

Quite frankly it hurts me a lot...

It hurts because i try to put a lot of myself into trying to make things better
into encouraging the right kind of atmosphere
and encouraging people to be more aware

i dunno.. maybe its cuz i greww up in a nice evangelical christian family
but i do think that there is a message that can be spread fromt he rave scene
i know some people think it is just about partying,
and i cant do much about that
but i do think that people can learn that there can be happiness
and respect and safety without having to carry a piece on them

whoever thinks it is right:
LA IS FUCKED UP

and thats why it needs a lot of help...
kids in LA arent going to learn that there is more to life than warfare
from their teachers, or their peers or the 50 some odd guys
on teh cornere selling rocks...
maybe its just cuz im in a college atmosphere and am deluded or something
but around me the only people i see going to help kids in the barrio
are kids who've managed to escape teh barrio
and i think thats fucked up, cuz there just arent enough...

what do raves have anything to do with this?
well i dunno.. it seems that a lot of the kids who go to raves in LA
come from these neighborhoods...
last summer there was a group of kids promoting, DJ'ing and etc
for a rad club down here...
and they and their friends were spending time setting up parties
instead of shooting at themseleves and others...

and i know of a club that was all ages that got shut down and they had
grandmothers calling up asking them to please start up again
cuz they knew that if their grandkids were there.. they would stay out  
of trouble...

yeah.. there are a lot of big scale hollywood attitudes taht float around
and try to make the scene more about being cool than doing something,
but there are a hell of a lot that arent like that
and it really sucks to be trying to do something 
for people who really need it
and get called "plastic hell"

 i hope no one's ever thought i've been saying LA is better than SF
cuz i wouldn't
i would say that LA needs more help than SF though...
and whether or not anyone takes it upon themselves to be involved with that
is their own decision...

i'm sure some day.. and probably some day soon.. i'll say fuck it..
and move out.. move some place where it's less challenging to live
the way i want to and and i can just be in a supportive environment..

but until then...

flame-boy

my big mouth...Mijos, as was discussed this weekend with Michelle and Erica:

 it must really suck for the actors of 90210/melrose to have to do these
stupid drug/rave episodes.I mean, they ARE actors, they MUST be on drugs!
"God, I have to have on seizure doing 'Euphoria' ? Ppplease!"
or "have some of this, party girl" she did look purdy high at court,tho....

point number two: dogs don't get laid enuf. We love our cats, spay/neuter
'em and let them pant on our rooftops, but how come our dogs never get any
noogie?We want to have man's best friend around, but why be so damn
possesive? Give the big guy an outlet, they ain't got hands.Can you
imagine, every time you smell some HEAT, yer owner pulls you away? No
wonder they do it in the middle of baseball fields!If I were to only get
some ONCE(!) in MY life, I'd bee damn shure I got stuck, too.

Sfravers, take Bill to visit Violet, lock 'em in the yard and have tea with
violet's owner for an hour. Bill and Violet will thank you, with saggy eyes
and bowed legs. Why else did Violet get a tube job? 

See y'all at kinetic, methinks, and hugs to all at Galen's saturday thingy,
hey, it will be the best $5 I spend....(plus toll, gatoraide, gas, a
quarter for the third guy to clean my window, yeah, I can loan you 5 for
some x, and Lyon's coffee/carbos...). 

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

ps. I still need a bugs-as-Carmen Miranda-print for a t-shirt. Any ideas?

Well now, what a wonderful gift, a cd from  the man who said it was cool
for a man to enjoy sex, but that the woman shouldn't really grin (just bare
it?). 

I wonder if my granma back in Brazil will give this CD set to my truely
saintly and devout uncle, but she has no such illusions herself about
incantations and a beurocratic religion. I'd love to see a
video,tho...there was a lousy song in brazil by a surfer-rock group, called
"O Papa e pop"-the Pope is pop(friggin prophets)! Altho all the signs were
there before, this is really it for me. I want a pope-and-bugs-T, with him
wearing  some pontificated baggies and chains with crosses, and maybe F&FV
could have a cool mix of this CD? Ambient Rosary...

 Before I get flamed, all religions get my respect ie. do what you want
with yer soul, and extend  the same  for me. I'm just amazed at the way
J.P. has moved with the times. Congrats, dude. I see no reason for people
who choose catholicism to have to feel antiquated, it SHOULD at least try
to relate to their everyday problems as well as the final one. Now if he
could move as fast on women's rights......

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee...

Ps. I heard the first 200 CDs had the jacket printed on 13th century
parchment..

The buzz on the Pope is that he's got some well-crafted but rigid lyrics,
he's against innovation in music, and while it's OK to have a few women
DJs, all discussion about letting women produce records is now forbidden.

I have to admit I know what it's like being in a scene that's self
destructing on itself.  I have to give the utmost respect to people like you
who are trying to keep their local scenes alive and make them better and
more positive.  Trying to do this in my hometown of LA gets double the
repect from me.  More power to you.

MICROSOFT Bids to Acquire Catholic Church

By Hank Vorjes

VATICAN CITY (AP) -- In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square
this morning, MICROSOFT Corp. and the Vatican announced that the
Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in
exchange for an unspecified number of shares of MICROSOFT common stock.
If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software
company has acquired a major world religion.

With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior
vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software
Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and
Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said
MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.

"We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to
ten years," said Gates. "The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the
Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for
a broader range of people."

Through the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, "we
will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time" and
revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling
indulgences, said Gates. "You can get Communion, confess your sins,
receive absolution -- even reduce your time in Purgatory -- all without
leaving your home."

A new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro
language which you can program to download heavenly graces
automatically while you are away from your computer.

An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's
Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello -- in
character as Father Guido Sarducci -- hosted the event, which was
broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.

Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello
chided Gates, "Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats,"
the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.

The deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and
the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such
masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci. But critics say MICROSOFT will
face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to
these key intellectual properties.

"The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures,"
said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. "You take the parting of
the Red Sea -- we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came
on the scene."

But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a
common Abrahamic heritage. "The Catholic Church has just been more
successful in marketing it to a larger audience," notes Notre Dame
theologian Father Kenneth Madigan. Over the last 2,000 years, the
Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while
Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted
by Christianity, lags behind.

Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor,
leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and
entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms
whereby all subjects were instilled with Catholicism, whether or not
they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several
denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used.
The Church's mission is to reach "the four corners of the earth,"
echoing MICROSOFT's vision of "a computer on every desktop and in every 
home".

Gates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable
religious architecture that will support all religions through
emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of
interfaces according to the religion desired -- "One religion, a couple
of different implementations," said Gates.

The MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions,
according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist
Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in
the increasingly competitive religious market.

If Microsoft has acquired the Roman Catholic Church, does this mean I
can't go to confession on my Mac?  I think that the Pope should have thought
of this first.  There are going to be a lot less Catholic Mac Users really
soon.  Apple should start looking to acquire all other religions quickly.

I'm going to be doing another winter solstice 24 hour house marathon on
wednesday December 21'st @kzsu.stanford. I was thinking about having a
party run concurently with it where we provide a signal & a place to go,
and the attendies provide the soundsystem (i.e. car radios, boomboxes) and
are left to themselves to organize the rest. I was wondering if you guys
think it would work. I'd like people who can't get it in from where they
live to be able to have a place to go. Your input is highly apreciated

This is a bit complicated:
If you're taking the bay bridge: take the 80 E after you cross so you head
to Berkeley.  Second or third exit will be Ashby.  Exit ashby and go east,
towards the hills.  You'll pass the Ashby Bart station on your right and
cross shattuck avenue.  Turn left at Telegraph and turn right on Dwight.
It will be on your left in one block.

have fun!

Well it's that time of year when we are conditioned to buy
our little brains out in the spirit of giving.  Some of us out there
may purchase more that others,  upon reflection of what has become
a national tradition, I have come to the realization that even though
some retailers make obscene amounts of money at this time of year,
others rely on this time to just stay open for the rest of the year.


I'm writing this note to encourage everybody out there in sfrave land
who does the buying thing to go down and shop at Ameba this holiday season.

Alan, please don't be embarrised that I'm posting this but I know
that you would be to considerate of our feelings to ask for help so
I'm asking for you :)  Alan and the folks at Ameba have given their
hearts and soul to the Scene over the last couple of years, and they
really need to make some revenue this season in order to make ends meet.
I'm serious. (being a businessman this year has opened my eyes, but I haven't
become a republican yet :) So if you are thinking about buying gifts
(useless, sensless or otherwise) please drop by Ameba and buy something,
you will be spending money in the community and helping out a group of folks
that have contributed soooo much to the SF Scene.  Your spending dollars
may not be tax deductable but they are going to keeping open the most
Vibe ridden spot on the Haight!

Pacific went off

So I guess after a month (or longer?) of parties at the
north beach basement someone clued in and changed the lock.
Kinetic successfully used the drafty waterfront warehouse
on Friday (I heard) and Pacific gave it a shot on Saturday.

As I arrived people claimed "no soundsystem, cops etc" and
we saw this paddy wagon pulling out.

The clever pacific gang spoke to the police: 
"yeah, there was supposed to be a party but no one showed up"
police - "any of you boys doing crack?" - "oh no sir ..."
within 15 minutes the party started :-)

This was the building SRL used.  It is huge and long with
hundreds of broken windows beautifully lit by the surrounding
dry dock yards; located on the water with it's own little
spooky industrial lagoon.  They setup in the middle of the 
building and lit 2 big bonfires off to each side.  This and the
people kept the place pretty warm.  Occasionally the flames lept
up really high - sparks and ash flying toward the rafters.  

I am fast becoming a Jon Howard fan.
His stuff is my cup of tea.
I think I am already a Galen fan.
I was going to comment on the first 1/2 hour of Galen's
set but I guess it was his first 1/2 hour set.  Please
correct me if the following was not him >

Anyway, I think he started with this Hip Hop bass heavy
tribally song - this was followed by more Thumping funked up
shake it *now* House.   One song had these crazy bass sounds 
that were somehow 'lightly plucked', they were Sensitive -
Gentle Giants lounging in a House Meadow - they would hang
there and Ride on this fantastic stompy rythm.  (I'm doing my
best to describe this) basically I was Moved Out of my Head.
way way way  Way Out

I obviously did not get my dancing fix last weekend cuz I was
itchy all over for this party.  I had great hopes that Pacific
would vibe off Howard's house flavors and I'd say they did.  
This kind of all-party-long coherence is part of Pacific's
charm.  There wasn't a heavy drug presence at the party.
Lots of friendly fatties were being passed around though!  
It was free and fun.  I got some fruit (mmmm) and 
loads of enthusiastic people to dance with!!

Connected a few sfr names to faces - Ethan and galaxy girl Tracy
and I had my eyes peeled for a red cap ... ;)

THE OFFICIAL SFRAVES SCREENSAVER FOR WINDOWS v1.1:
* TRIBAL FUNK 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY *
UPGRADE VERSION: PICTURES ONLY!
by DJ Dave Alga
FILENAME: SFRSS11U.ZIP
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of releasing an upgrade version of the screen saver
every time I make a new one, I just decided to release the
pictures only for those of you who don't have a PC, don't
use Windows, or whatever reason.  These are in .JPG format.
I included a JPG --> GIF converter in the pack for those
of you who can't view .JPG files.  Also, the file is much
smaller this way (380k).  So, it should be a short download.
If you have any more questions, leave me mail.  It has been
uploaded to hyperreal.com in the directory /incoming, but may
be moved to the /tools/pc/graphics.  Thanks for your support.

just wanted to add to dave's comments about the pacific party
being incredible!

  when we got to the sight you had to walk a bit but when you
saw the building it was incredible! big airy warehouse with bass
pumping from inside.  when i got inside and saw the people
and the bonfires and everything going on, i was like: yes! this
is what its all about. so i went of dancing and going around
meeting new people and giving hugs left and right! the vibe was
perfect, really chilkl with people into the music. I really liked
the start when the thick acid came on and even went up to around
the 140 bpm range. very nice. :)
   special thanks to the pacific people for continuing the vibe and
for all the people for making me realize why i keep coming back
to dance :)

sfravers met there: ernie, loren (calendar), 

peace and all dat

 Atomic Dog will not be on Monday night Dec. 12. However it will be held
on the night before Sunday Dec. 11. I realize that in previous discussions 
I stated that it would be on the 12th. At the time this was the correct 
information, but do to work constraints for the majority of the crew it has
been moved back to the 11th. I apologise to anyone who bought tickets to the
Dead show baised on the previous information. Once again in the north
parking
lot of the Oakland Colisium - Atomic Dog Sunday Dec. 11 - music should start
around 7 pm. I'll post a flier a little later in the week. See you on the
11th.

Ah life...

It never ceases to amaze  me.  The wonders and intensity of certain 
expreriences.  Saturday night with Dubtribe and my friends was incredible!
 We arrived at the Groovilicious Love Tribe's gathering hall around 12:30am.  
There weren't many people around as of yet.  However, there was a palpable 
sense of excitement as the events of the evening started to congeal and take 
form.  

Prior to their set, I spoke with Sunshine and Moonbeam.   We caught up on the 
events of our lives since we last saw each other and affirmed our bonds of 
friendship.  These guys have been an inspiration to me.  I know that they 
will continue to be as life progresses into the future.  We watched the 
crowd dancing and noticed the fluctuation of the energy levels on the 
dance floor as certain songs and a switch of the Dj's came into effect.  
Sunshine related their worries about the attendance tonight.  We looked at 
the crowd, which numbered about 125-150 at that time.  We both came to the 
conclusion based on the very visible energy level that we had enough people 
for the makings of a wonderful party.   

They told me that they've recently acquired a Quadra 650 and some music 
software (I can't quite remember which one) and have been utilizing it quite 
a bit to refine their songs.   They were scheduled to start at 2:30am. I 
looked forward to hearing the difference in the music.  What new surprises 
did they have in store for us?

As we talked and basked in the glow of each other's presence, DJ Cory from 
San Francisco (who came up with Dubtribe) played a wicked set which blended 
funky happy house, trance and tribal choons into a cocktail that soon had 
everyone grrrooovin' and smilin'.  I hardly realized that I had worked myself 
onto the dance floor.  The place had started to fill up.  The atmosphere 
thickened as the vibe level progressed.  As I was dancing, I noticed a young 
woman (definitely a newbie) beside me just BUSTIN' IT!  We had both looked up 
at about the same time and I introduced myself.  There was an awkward moment 
as she was surprised to have someone actually come up to her and talk.  The 
awkwardness, however, dissolved as we exchanged smiles and connected on a 
level of understanding that we were where we were supposed to be at that time 
and place.

After dancing for a while, I went to the back room and chilled with some 
friends and connected with some great new wonderful people.  The atmosphere 
was wonderfully conducive to breaking down social barriers and making 
connections.  As I sat upon this wonderfully cushy couch, I was approached by 
someone whom I remember having met several times.  She approached me rather 
shyly and with some nervousness. She said that she had wanted to tell me me 
something and did not quite know how.  I set her at ease and we started  
talking.  She related to me how she had started coming to the parties and her 
progression from newbie to full pledged raver.  She talked about the times at 
the Choc-Lit Factory, a club that we ran collectively at the Velvet Elvis 
Theatre in January and February this year.  She then proceeded to blow my 
mind as she related how much of an inspiration I've been to her.  How what we 
did changed her life and made a difference.  She spoke about her spiritual 
awakening and my role in that.  All this from a person I barely knew.  I was 
struck dumb and speechless.  I was overwhelmed with gratitude, a sense of awe 
and also fear.  Fear because I always worry about setting a bad example and 
because I know my limits and fallibilities all too well.  I came to the 
realization that she had given me one of the greatest gifts anyone has ever 
given to me in my life.  This gift from her I accept wholeheartedly and with 
the purest joy.  It is said that the acceptance of a gift honors the giver.  
Inspiration begets inspiration.  She also has given me the gift of 
inspiration.  I know that what she had passed on to me will have an effect on 
the things that I do and how I do it.  I am resolved to honor her gift by 
expressing to all the people who have inspired me how much of a difference 
they have made in my life.  Life is indeed sweet.

Almost everyone immediately headed to the dance floor as we heard Dubtribe 
start up.  WOW!  Their music definitely  had a difference to it since I last 
heard them.  The music was richer, deeper, more organic.  They seem to have 
struck a nice balance between the electronic and organic elements of their 
style.  They played a bunch of new stuff and of course some classics.  But 
everything seemed new somehow.  It was wonderful.  People were totally 
groovin' and trancing.  The connections between spirits were visible, 
healthy, alive.  We were transported into a different dimension where 
communion and transncendance were possible and very real.  We were alive!

After their set, I went back to the back room to relieve my exhaustion with 
lots o' fresh H20, warm hugs and the cushy  couch.  and there I stayed 
talking, puppy piling and exchanging smiles with my friends until it was time

Checked out Kinetic on Fri, which was at the same large warehouse Down To
Earth as at on Saturday. There was a small crowd of 100 or so at around
2:30,  grooving to John Howard, who spun a great set, as did Tracy, who
successfully enticed the early arrivals to get up an dance.

Down To Earth ended up at the same place on Sat., as their first location,
a break-in unbeknownst to them, became unavailable. There were 4-5 times as
many people as were there for Kinetic, and a great vibe. Thanks to two
fires and the number of people it wasn't overly chilly. Cyril, Galen, John
Howard, and Solar tag teamed for a bit (I think) - quite a bit of acid
tinged house. Perfect.

Due to the large number of people dancing in front of the speakers the
sound was a bit muddy - too bad they couldn't have raised the tops a bit.

Around 2:30 a security guard showed up yelling and threatening to call the
cops. Galen convinced him not to by making a donation, and the party went
all night.  wonder about the viability of future parties at this site,
though. The cops evidently were cool when they came by, but if they had a
complaint I'm sure they'd have no qualms about shutting it down.

Major props to Pacific for throwing a free party in the face of adversity.

__

Happened to pick up a Cool World (everyone's favorite party to hate) New
Year's Eve flyer on Sunday. Hmmm, and people give LA shit for having major,
overdone, commercial parties? Sheesh. Umpteen page color booklet, 5 areas,
boasts of their 20,000 person capacity, patting themselves on the back in
print for offering pre-sale tickets for the low, low, price of $20. Ahem.
Well, I guess you know what you're in for. Can't blame them for doing what
they do.

My big problem, and the grossest inaccuracy on the flyer is the claim that
the KLF are playing. Oh, what's that in small letters? Oh, the KLF
experience w/Wanda Dee. This is a sham. Wanda Dee was a backup singer on
some of their songs and is trying to cash in on the KLF name by dancing
around as canned KLF tunes are played. Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, the
real musicians behind the KLF haven't toured in ages and are quite pissed
at this ploy. From what I understand they're pursuing legal action as well.
It's a bit disingenuous for Cool World to take part in this farce.

Oh well, it's always fun to take digs at the biggies, and maybe their
hearts are in the right place and they don't care about the $ and just want
to expuse PLUR to a larger audience. There's always an alternative.

There are no viruses that you can receive simply by reading a piece of email.
The only possible way you could harm a system by email is if someone sent 
a uuencoded (or Binhexed) file, you decoded it, and ran it on your machine.

I recall hearing about one that was spread about through inet mail. I 
don't think it necessarily has to be uuencoded.

     the good times virus is actually not a virus but a special strain. 
the chances of it working are slim but it might so look out. two of my

When you ftp it, make sure that you have typed "bin" at the ftp prompt 
before "get"'ing anything.  Otherwise, you may be translating the binary 
zip file into a useless ascii mess.

I have a question to people who have been raving in the SF area for at 
least 2 years.  Does anyone remember UP3 (i think it's acshully Up 
cubed)?? They used to have a voicemail thing where they talked about 
upcoming parties, discussed recent raves, etc, etc.  Kind of like the 
Elmo line in a way.  This was about 2 years ago.  Whatever happened to 
them??  I remember calling up one day and the line was disconnected.  
This was back when I had just started ravin' and I remember really lookin 
forward to hearing what was on the up line each nite. I remember them 
just talkin' about the scene and being really positive. Does anyone know 
if they acshully threw parties or just had a voice mail? Does anyone know 
what became of them??
Jus' wonderin',

HAPPINESS IS BEING AMONG FRIENDS

i went by the gardening club
it seemed nice

a mellow crowd swilling Samba Boombas
smoking cigarettes and gossiping 

i met Flash from Tribal Funk and
dj Aquaman - there's a joke there
but i can't find it ...

Funky Techno Tribe vs Cool World on NY's eve
can't say either look to appealing

Galen's security guard bribe was, ahem, above
and beyond - at least from this starving student's
perspective

Growing disatisfaction with Wicked seems to be about
and I hear they are dirt poor (who isn't?)

I heard an Oregon dj named Matt play some very 
interesting "ambient" - lots of beatlesque, old
western, odd record type stuff all mixed in with
other wierd sounds.  It was not the cheeseball
supersmooth Yanni junior crap I usually hear.
Video stylings by Synergy and some folks just
plop down and watch 'em like a movie.  The
Carribean Zone is just about perfect for 
this little gathering and they have
those really nice wood matches
grab me a box will ya?

...make me feel good, every time...Jello, Mijos!

Well, the hemp rally got rained out on sat, and on sunday, Jovi, Todd and
moi were busy sleeping (well, they were...).But it did go off sunday....

Got an overdose of Daves on saturday (ahhh, ok, never enuf!) and got to see
Santa Cruz rave godess Tracy and met Derek (the east-bay one). I tink he's
goin' to wicked wit me.....

At Galen's shindig, tho, there were a few drunk homies stopping just short
of ass-grabbing, and this depressed my pet space cheerleader (Annette), but
as Ahmit,several Daves, Richard and several other of my referred "good
ones" showed up and sat with us, she gradually accepted the safety of their
escort and enjoyed herself. What a way to prove point!

Two of the aforementioned gluteal offenders DID find x and as their drunken
pals went home to sleep it off, they remained at least till 4 and were
strutting, swaying and at last dancing, while smiling like there were
mudskippers in their pants. And they had no more offensive behavior.
Especially after being accepted by some of us, and receiving candy. Maybe
they get the point?

Friday, well, same place as saturday, but 1/5 the people, still an
excellent party. Yes, it eeez Kinetic. They got a good thing goin', and for
all the right reasons. Warm squishies!
 This warehouse is all I ever dreamed of when I moved here. If I ever win
the lottery, I'll buy it, install a chill room at the far end (where they
got that doomed "house") and make loft for myself and some excllent
sfravers, and let it ou for free evry day. Gotta dream......

At down to earth, I saw two workers across the "industrial lagoon", wearing
the blue overalls and helmet, and one sorta hung on the fence, the other
danced and beat his butt on his buddy, a la Ren&Stimpy (happyhappyjoyjoy!).

More gathered, asked what was up (a party, U Idiot!) and were promptly
invited to a FREE party, but they turned down my invite (No, I WAS NOT in a
dress).
They seemed to think it was ok, we went on for 2 hours after the first one
was sighted.

Galen did this for free, and I saw no donation box. If you read this,
little feller, thank you so much, our crew did our best to give out as many
toys and candy and hugs to pick up any stragglers, and I'm shure everyone
was blown pretty durn well....what will they think of next?

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....(achoo!)

Um, sorry if they got $ problems, I wish good fortune to all, and  Wicked
is an awesome party and easily worth the $, if not more. My heart and
wallet go out to them. But does anyone suppose that Pacific is funded by
Galen's millionaire oil-baron father? Good, I didn't think so....

Now, this full moon thingy still makes my socks cling. Look, it's free, ok,
and it ain't easy to throw, but CAN YOU GUYS JUST CHANGE THE FRIGGIN'
MESSAGE WHEN YOU CANCEL?!  Just a little consideration, ppplease! I'll
party this saturday, I'll smile and bounce and hug, but Allen and pals,
when that far off  satellite lights up yer kitchen window, go to the phone
tell us where, or tell us why not and send us yer love. If you won't do it
anymore, ask the faithful to get someone else. 

See, I'll shake my tail feather on any expanse of sand listening to
Pacific, Mother earth, FTT, Martin's crew, Cloud factory,just about anyone
with love for us and consideration as well. Can you imagine, two or three
systems join up, get a bunch of DJ's pleading to play a 40 minute set for
all these happy people?  I can see it now: "Yeah, Deaks, you can come on
after Goa Gil and before Galen, and we'll fit the rest of you guys in
tonight, anyone else have their records here?...." It ain't only the sound,
at the FMR, IT IS THE PEOPLE. Man does not live on Garth alone....

I'm not pickin' on you guys, ok, but I think we have to do something as a
group to get a monthly event going with the type of spirit the moon used to
have.  Can anyone take up this thread and get some people moving together?

Or maybe I should shut up again, who knows? I just had to get that off my
fingertips, thank you for listening (I just want my moonpie!).

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

ps. last nite, and today as well, watch the moon rise over the bay, and see
how like the Chesire cat's smile it is. And if anyone is frying with you,
blow their minds with this. Ah, friends are soooo easy to please.....

Hello!

I love reading this list! The spirit of community and the overall vibe is 
awesome! I think that the stories about your collective exploits and 
activities are an inspiration to everyone. I frequently forward special 
posts to friends in Australia, Germany, South Africa...and to many people 
in good ol' SeaTown here. They are well received.

I have a few questions, though.

What is Wicked? A club? An ongoing party? Fill me in!

Does anyone make mix tapes from parties a-la-Grateful-Dead-bootleg style? 
Lemme tell ya...I got one tape from Cindy of Carlos (who melted my brain
cell by exquisite cell) but like every junky I need MORE! MORE! MORE! 
(Due to various paternal and financial responsibilities, I can't go to
parties every weekend....but I can bomb the bass in my office 8 hours a
day!) I would love to set up a mix-tape-exchange thingy or something. Is 
anyone interested in doing this with me?

What is the deal with raves in Dead show parking lots? As the only
hardcore deadhead-techno freak that I know of, I would like to meet more
people like myself. I'm kind of tired of being the only one who will jam
out just as hard to a Kraftwerk remix as a hot Chinacat. Also, most of (if
not _all_of_) my Deadhead friends think that techno is garbage. In
addition to that, most of my raver friends think that the Dead sound like
a cross between a high school garage band and a bucket of warm spit. I'm 
sure that other deadhead/techno-freaks will understand my predicament.

One project that I'm working on is bringing these two disparate cultures 
together a little more. I am part of a non-profit organization that 
sponsors arts events (read: full-bore parties in the woods) and I would 
like to work with some folks down in the Bay area on something similar. 
Last year we had a festival that was attended by 3500 people for three days 
up by Snoqualmie pass. We're doing it again next August and hopefully 
have enough money to buy land so that we can have our own site for a 
variety of activities. Sound interesting? Drop me a line...

Well I used to think the Full Moon was thrown by different groups each
month.  Imagine one month Wicked , next a Gathering, then MESS, that's how
I thought it was a couple years ago when I was kinda vague on things.  This
would be great but someone bold would have to step forward to take charge,
things like bickering between groups, people feeling left out, and many
other problems could arise (but not necessarily).  I've always wanted to
throw a Full Moon but was also wary of stepping on Wicked's feet...seems
kind of rude to just say ok this month we're going to do a party too.
Maybe Wicked (hint, hint) could do some organizing of the type we have just
thrown out.  The Wicked crew could take a break by electing other posses to
get together for a month or each take a month or something...anyways next
summer we'll probably do a Full Moon type thing in SC/Monterey area so
watch for it :)

the party is.  It will be near downtown Monterey.  Our voicemail

Grandfather,
Look at our brokenness.

We know that in all creation
Only the human family
Has strayed from the Sacred Way.

We know that we are the ones
Who are divided
And we are the ones
Who must come together
To walk in the Sacred Way.

Sacred One,
Teach us love, compassion, and honor
That we may heal the Earth
And heal eachother

But he just might be able to live on Jeno :)

Seriously though, it would be cool if someone else took on the FMR
resposibilitys everyonce in a while to give em' a rest. Although nobody
does renegades like Wicked, it would be nice if we had something to go to
every month, which is too much to ask of them $ wise.

Mijos, how many of you would:
 go to a fmr thrown by another system, if wicked flaked?
 go to a fmr running at the same time as "theirs", if the message got out
earlier, confirming djs and local?

Answer both, send 'em to me, and I'll compile it. Now cummon, please do
answer me, but make it short (ex: A yes/ B hell yes!). I'll post the
results, if anyone anwers. So, hardcore netheads and all the lurkers, just
vote fer sumthin' useful......(please put your subject header "FMR QUEST"
only, to make it easier)


Lotsa love,

Mijos, last thingy:

Allen (allan?): dude, yer fmr and Wicked rock. No doubts. Real clean, cool job.
I just hate missing something this important, where everyone is violently
happy. If it's getting too pressing and big (ooh!), take a break, call
Carlos,  maybe change the message and say "Right! Excellent! Tonight...the
fmr...is being done by CDC and Pacific combined. Di-rections: okay, you
take 80 north till....please drive carefully, and bring your smiles, your
love, your energy, and ..." And maybe you can enjoy the party yerself
instead of always throwing it, as can Garth and Thomas etc..

Seems that with such a diversity of djs and systems, as well as sub-tribes
in our village, we should make the fmr more of a community thing.There is
no reason everyone can't sit together and plan out the next fmr, we are all
responsible adults by now, even if we are only little children.

 Plus I might finally get to Hear Goa Gil go off for 6 friggin' hours on a
beach....teehee!

Come/Unity report
=================

Ok,   all you folks who work during the week.    Come/Unity at 1015 Folsom
St was absolutly incredible.    Down in the basement,  DubTribe was pumpin 
out some incredible trancey Ambient beats that kept me in the chill area
totally tranced out,   bouncing my brains off the walls.    When the
mesmerizing music changed to the point where I regained conciousness,
I headed up to the main dance area just in time to dance to one of the most
brilliant sets by Garth I've heard in a long time.    Man that guy KICKS
ASS big time....  For a "Middle of a week" event,  the place was packed,
with hardly a space to dance.   Even the stage area was packed.  The vibe,
only known by the Come/Unity tribe was amazing.    I've still got a big
fat smile on my face right now as I write this,   as I'm taking a break
from work (which I started very early - Oh! More hours... Yummie...)

On my way back from dancing all night,  I did the usual stop at the
24 Hour nautilus health club and did a killer work out... WOW!!  I feel
GREAT!!!   Now,  I'm sitting here,  cranking out code,  putting stuff
between the curlie cues {  },  still with the biggest grin that my face
can hold....     

Oboy!!  And this Sat evening is WICKED..... now,  If I can get some sleep
between now and Saturday,    I'll certainly be there.....  Just look for
the crazy idiot bouncing around with a big grin on his face,  like there
is no tommorrow....

Later.....
C. Crunch

And if you go to wicked this saturday, ask Jeno what's up......(Milton,

far, but I'll keep compiling till saturday, maybe monday. [The questions,

Perhaps, if enough people are heard, someone else may be willing to take a

since sfraves is swarming with people, I thought I might add a bit of humor
to everyone's day.  In my French class today we watched a video of a French
news broadcast someone taped while in France.  Among the disturbing events
that were reported a new study revealed that the French take three times as
many drugs as the rest of Europe!  Their drugs of choice included
antibiotics, heart medication and my favorite, antidepressants...on a side
note, the British take more painkillers than anyone else (yum!  i just love
to pop a vicodin or demerol before I skip off to class, or float as the case
may be =) anyway, I thought it was quite funny...hope you do too =)

Yeeeee-owsers, lots of people are getting sick right about now...  For

  No more prying eyes from workmates!
  Now I can stay up late night Web-Netsurfing...
  Now I can spin out email left, right, above me AND below me (believe it
or don't).


So to all of you wonderful people that know me, (or that I've exchanged
mail with as a result of SFR), please drop me [Todd Spaulding] a small note
of some sort to this new mail address just to acknowledge that you saw this
message.  Unfortunately, I lost all of my email addressbooks when I changed

I think upstairs at 1015 and King St are evil twin brothers.
Really crowded, painfully loud in places (behind speakers is
reasonable), lotsa fog, and Jeno/Garth were kinda uneven.
They had their moments.  The people were Grade A Fabulous
Dancing Maniacs and time flew by - I couldn't believe
it was 3 already when I (conservatively) decided I
I should get some sleep.

OK all you 18 -21 year olds. How many of you voted a month ago?
Get on the phone and thell these people:

		1) You are old enough to vote
		2) You are old enough to enlist in the armed forces and die
		   for your country.
		3) You are old enough to drive, and you will be placed in the
		   adult jail if you are arrested so...

You should damn well be able to stay out past 2 am without being 
harrassed by the police! 

Make sure you call the mayors office and specifically send fax, telegrams, letters
to this captain michael yalon, commanding officer guy.   If every one on sfraves
sent a FAX to this guy maybe he would realize that he just put his foot
in a hornets nest and back off.  On the other hand if your just gonna whine
about it then nuthin gonna happen.

...mation Service

I've decided to embark on possibly/hopefully tedious and time-consuming but
certainly interesting and rewarding venture, which I hope you as a music
listener ccan help me out on.

I want people to be able to send email to me with the name of an 
artist/producer/DJ/album/single, or whatever, and be able to get back any of
the following:

1.A list of titles by said person(s).

2.A list of compilations they appear on.

3.Other works that they have something to do with.

4.Similar artists that they might be compared to.

5.More than one (hopefully) review of particular works of said artist or album.


I would like people to submit a review and information about albums they have
recently gotten (especially), or albums that they have gotten in the past that
they have liked.  To send such a review, it would contain the following 
information:

Artist, album/single name, and any mentionable (or unmentionable :) people
involved, or for compilations, a list of artists and the mentionable people
involved.

Any other information as to how to get the item, such as record label or
whatever.

Vague hint as to what kind of music it might be classified as.


And if you so wish to put the time into it, the following optional information:

Artists you would compare this one to, or artists that you would listen to with
this one.

Maybe something like: "This artist is a cross between..."

A brief description/review of the album/single.

A rating from 1 to 10, 10 being the best (in your opinion: music quality is an
opinion of course), of the album/single, which will be averaged in if there are
other ratings of the same album.
Anything else you might want to mention about this artist, or artists involved
in this single/album.


Right now I'm doing this all by hand.  However, in the future I will be running
it off of our internet server, and will automate it, so the format of your
requests and contributions doesn't matter.


The email address to send to is:

                        jesus.chrysler@sfnet.com

When you send me something, I will save your address unless you request other-
wise, and will send you any nw information about artists that you request for.

Hope to be hearing from y'all!
                        JC

An under 21 curfew?  I've never heard anything so ridiculous!  Don't they
realize that most people over 18 live on their own and take care of
themselves and are taxpayers?  Aw man, FUK DAT!

On one of those snare-drum-crescendos-to-nowhere I swear I could feel
blood squirting out.  Is this one of those feel alive/feel the pain
type experiences?

> "behind the speakers" is *never* reasonable...

Hmmm, I wasn't aware this was some sort of power raver location.
I do occasionally get these inspirational urges to point and shout
at people, though  - "you, baby, do It"  "up girl Move it Up"  ;-)

And, ya know, I was gratuitously Gyrated On while dancing behind
a speaker (table dance?) (apparently I was 'in her house' ...)
What Will those young ravers think !!

So duz anybody know when the last BART from Oaktown goes back to SF?

When will Atomic Dog end?

Will A.D. end after BART closes? < asks Niels

I think the last BART leaves at midnight, but I would check on that.
Atomic Dog will end betwwen 12:00 - 12:30 so if you stay to the very end
you'll probly miss BART.

Thanks for the welcome!

Hmmm...  F&F5 or The Gathering...

I love both the Friend & Family "family" as much as The Gathering "family",
but there will always be another Martin party...
    -BUT-
I have only been to one Gathering, and it was an excellent party, but a bad
night for me... I somehow feel the need to make up for something with
another shot.  I've also boycotted larger parties twice now in order to go
to F&F's...  This is good, but perhaps there is a balance to my raving
madness (NO relation to Space Madness)?

I have a Saturday evening crash singing rehersal for a Vivaldi piece I
haven't seen in about a year.  After possibly partying that Saturday night
(I must resevoir my energies WISELY!), I will perform the piece Sunday
evening in an "Alumni Concert" (for all singers that had been a part of
this group in present and years past, as I was).  Being in the concert is
one of those ("not to be missed") personal things, so I have a big
obligation to reserve enough energy for it.

Hmmmm...  I think I'm going to be able to swing going to _A_ party that
Saturday night.  (This much my 'great' Brilliance has conquered for his
mind.)  WHAT party I will go to is STILL up in the air.

Somehow, my body tells me that an intense sound system like what will be
available at The Gathering is more of the INPUT_LEVEL I seek right now in
my life.  Friends & Family is just the BEST, but I have shifted from a
personal_contact_needing stage to a personal_growth_from_within stage.

Hmm...  and $$$ is always a factor.  F&F will be the best deal in town --
and I can't beat the vibe...  And The Gathering will happily drain my
unhappy, non-reptile-skin-wallet/kind-of-canvas'y paper and metal money
organizer - but one fucking blast-to-be, no doubt.


Oh, I can't stand it.

BOTH PARTIES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE THE SHIT!
 (AKA, Totally Awesome "The Shit" Coolness Factor -- for sure!)

What to do...what to do?

Would the ACLU be interested in this kind of an issue?
If so, should we contact them?

if you can check this out and tell me if you like it.  I would like to get
more info on the law.  I had been told it was overturned, but it seems as
if it was not by today's posts.  Mostly if someone with good writing and
communication skills wants to write up a letter that people can print out

Correct me if im wrong, but I was under the impression that this was a
California law & was taken out of effect a while ago. I remember hearing
something about the SF police saying they would still enforce the defunct law.
Does anybody know if it was on the SF ballot a month ago, I voted in a
different county.

Unfortunatly most 21+ people don't realy care enough to take the time to
do this since it doesn't realy effect them directly & I don't think there
are many 18-21 year old sfravers.

	An easy decision for me to make on the weekend of Dec. 17th is 
The Gathering. First, last year's Gathering happened about this time and 
it ROCKED! Second, I feel that the Gathering will go off again because 
I've been feeling the energy for weeks. Most people have been in school 
for the last 16 weeks and will be done with finals ready to kick in the 
holiday season. And if they are feeling anything like me they are 
going to ROCK! The Gathering has had consistently good parties and at this 
time of the year with the break at hand, I think people will bring 
tremendous positive, full of love, super squishy, full of funk vibes to 
this one. I know I will.
	Hope to see many new and old wonderful faces there. 

ready to squash that stuff,

dhouse

I think you might be surprised at the number of 18-21 old sfravers out
there.  Even if there are not that many we could take this issue to people
outside sfraves.  If someone does write a letter that they want to share
I'll run off copies with my money and the Cloud Factory will pay for stamps
to take them to raves and get people involved directly at raves (maybe in
the south of market area :)  We could ask a couple knowledgeable people on
the subject to help make a display to put on the wall at F&F and other
events...

Greetings!

With all the recent angst about which party to go to, I thought I'd stick
my nose in to offer a philosophical point of view.  Precede all paragraphs
below with "IMO":

San Francisco, the Bay Area, and indeed, the entire West Coast, is filled
with lots of great parties.  The ratio of stinkers to triumphs seems to
have taken a dramatic turn for the better this year, compared to last
(a really good thing!).

There's a special kind of energy that only comes at a massive (indoors or
out).

There's a special kind of energy that only comes from a renegade done with
a few close friends.

There's a special kind of energy that only comes at a one-off.

There's a special kind of energy that comes from a weekly club.

One of the best parties I've been to recently was a massive that i thought
beforehand was going to be really sketchy (Tribal Funk at the Cow Palace).
I didn't think I could have a good time at a massive in that location, but
I gave it a try and had a great time.  Another great party that I go to
(and help organize) is Friends and Family, which has the killer vibe and
intimacy of a close knit group of friends, and which I've been able to help
shape in ways that make me happy, so it feels like "my" party.  I have also
enjoyed Space Lab, which was a fine, smallish techno party that ran weekly.
I also enjoy renegades (except when i get a ticket :-), coz it's really nice
to watch the sun rise, and see the clouds and moon and stars at night with
really nice music and friends.

I guess my point is that most of the successful parties are not one-offs,
and so it's almost always possible to catch another edition of the same
thing if you can't make it to a particular version.  So, my advice to those
who are faced with multiple parties on the same night is:  if possible, 
party hop.  But, always, follow your heart, and go to the one that most
appeals to you, where you'll be the most comfortable, have the most fun,
and that has the music, merriment, and vibe you are looking for ~that night~.
And, check out another party the next time, especially one you can't really
see yourself necessarily enjoying, and try your best to make it the best
party for yourself by inviting friends along, getting them hyped about it,
travelling together with friends, hanging out together, getting involved
in planning, and doing something fun for others at the party.  Magically,
eventually, *all* the parties you go to will be great, because you'll
have made them ~your~ party, and everyone there will be your friends and
family.

     Hi everyone.  I'm new to SF, just moved here from Salt Lake City, 
     where I was deeply into the rave scene there, and now...trying to get 
     into it here.  But I seem to have the worst luck in the world at 
     choosing the right place to go to.  I've been to a Wicked party last 
     year, had a blast, are they still as fun?  Are there any things going 
     on during the week that don't start after midnight.  I live in SF, but 
     work in Mt. View, so I make the dreaded 1 hour commute each morning, 
     so I don't like to stay out too late during the week.  Suggestions???
     
     Hope to meet some you soon!

  An equally easy decision for me - Friends and Family V 
  on the 17th! The last one still reigns as the best event 
  I've ever been to (though this last month  has had some 
  near misses!). 
  
  In addition to excellent DJing from new and old faces, 
  F&F V promises two live acts, Weird Blinking Lights 
  and BPM/0, both of which I've heard lots of positive 
  things about but never seen for myself. Also, the 
  ventilation problem that made things a tad sweaty at 
  the last event should be resolved for this one.
  
  Hope to see and meet more of you SFR people there!

Jello, mijos!

Just a teaser: Todd spaulding has a new account, and a new login,
"infinity" named after a wonderful, stratospheric outdoor party in the
summer, the night of his birthday and the blossoming of many a raver. Guess
he liked the party too!

Welcome back, mijo!


(his biblical babblings:)
     Eeeeee-hee heeee!        ...Internet Access.

  No more prying eyes from workmates!
  Now I can stay up late night Web-Netsurfing...
  Now I can spin out email left, right, above me AND below me (believe it
or don't).

So to all of you wonderful people that know me, (or that I've exchanged
mail with as a result of SFR), please drop me [Todd Spaulding] a small note
of some sort to this new mail address just to acknowledge that you saw this
message.  Unfortunately, I lost all of my email addressbooks when I changed
accounts, so I feel a NEED for CONTACT right about now, if you know what I
mean.    :e
Thanks...

Love and Positivity Always   ;-)

 Jayzuz, what happens to "kids" if the cops come to an all-ages party not
in a club? Does that mean arrest/fines?

If we write to these turds and complain to the (correct)papers, will that help?

A rally at city hall in full raver gear?

What to do, what to do?

Yes, David is completely right.  The Gathering 2 year anniversary was 
*THE SHIT*.  I still remember it vividly.  If this year will be just as 
good if not better, I have great reason to be as excited as I am now.  
Everything I am feeling right now revolves around the 17th. (I'm sick 
now, as long as I'm well by the 17th...I'm broke now as long as I have $ 
for the 17th...etc)

Yeah, there are, plus I am going to make fliers about this with the adress

hand them out at the next few parties I attend. Lets break some COJONES,

Actually, the deal is: BART's last trains leave their terminal locations at
12:00 which, in this case, means Fremont (unless you live *south* of the
coliseum)...so prolly 12:20 is is more like it though it is a 10 minute
hoof from the lot the station. BART often runs late for shows at the
coliseum so a call to BART might be in order...

I mean this as no dis to Martin and I encourage to people to go wherever
they'll be happiest....

However, as far as *sound* goes (and excuse my conceit here) I agree that
The Gathering will have *bigger* sound but *I think* Friends & Family will
have far *better* sound. Providing great sound to 2000 people is
*extremely* difficult. Providing great sound to 300 people in a room
designed to sound good is far easier. Ask anybody that was at the last F&F,
sound-wise, we've got that room *wired*

As an historic aside, it was at the basics finale (the first one :) that it
first occurred to me to throw parties and play records :) Martin does throw
a fine party.

Might be gettin time for a Basics/Friends & Family :) Martin?

In any event, I hope we see you at Friends & Family and I hope Martin sees
you as well, and, for that matter, I hope *we* see martin too ;-) and I'm
sure he hopes he sees us.....

Hopefully our low cost will allow those of you that care to the option of
choosing both parties that night.

Have a great 17th!

Oh!!  Decisions Decisions!!!   Gack!!!   Gathering -- F&F ---  Which one?

Was talking to Martin,  who very much wanted me to set up an Internet WWW
Browser machine at this upcoming Gathering.    I told him it conflicted with
F&F,  and most self respecting SFRaver will probably not want to set up
and watch his machine at the Gathering.   But,  I thought I woould at least
mention it here.    Perhaps one can go to the Gathering first,   set up
his machine for a few hours,  then book over to F&F.    There are all
these possibilities.   For me,  I'm totally in the indecision mode at
this time.    So,  for those more "Portable" mahine owners,   who would
want free addmission to the Gathering,   going to BOTH and getting into
the Gathering for free,   certainly is attractive.  

Of course it all depends on the location of the Gathering.    For instance,
if it's at a good SF venue,  like the Armory,   or perhaps the Galleria,
I might consider trucking over there later,   and eventually make F&F or
"Party hop".   But if the Gathering is in Richmond CIVIC Ctr (A very big
venue),   I certainly won't be party hopping,  at least not alone.

The big disadvantage of party hopping,   is that while in altered state
of conciousness,  I'm not that anxious to drive very far.    But if the
Gathering is at the Galleria,  or other SOMA location,   I would consider
walking there.     Well!!  I guess we all just have to see how feasable
it is for the "Party hopping" idea.   I certainly want to go to BOTH,
but in either case,    I plan on GETTING OFF!!  BIG TIME!!

See ya all there....

I second this request for the nitty gritty
although the lineup looks like God's Gift to my Sneakers ...
I think that may say it all 

these are the Groove Kitchen folks, no?
the Stompy Family threw an awfully nice party at the Troc this summer
with lots of Beautiful Sweaty People

the Gathering is gonna be huge and
probably located in Miami next weekend

i know this list is bastion of F&F devotees but
the do it yourself super eclectic nature of the one
I attended was not my thing - shades of Donnie and Marie
meet the Internet - certainly nothin I say will prevent the
party from going off, that's almost a given, ain't it?

Mijos, are we shure they are gonna enforce this? I called up Cpt.Yalon, he
was out, so the permit people talked to me, and they said "yeah, no night
clubs/warehouses or anything, but  it's OK TO BE ON THE STREET."

              Basically, you can't GATHER if yer "under age".

But they seemed not really too adamant, so maybe we should see what happens
this weekend, rather than call attention.........(my good, silent friend's
advice.)

BUT, if shit flies this sat, tho, we should start writing and flyering,BUT
MAKE SHURE that each letter/fax to mr.serv-n-protect ends with a 
 CC/ Bay Area Guardian, 
     SF Weekly
     Chron/Ex
     SF Board of Supervisors (need some names here)
     ACLU?
That way he knows the shit isn't just coming up from the sewer(us) but that
it rains from above as well.....he is,after all, only following orders
(HEIL!), so he must be made to know that he isn't the only one getting our
complaints.

If he pushes us, we should come up with a sfraver letter (as suggested by
Drenalin), and all posters/lurkers should fax it in to the cops and the
papers; and generate a flier to hand out to those concerned at
gathering/F&F/stompy stomp, the info bearing out the problem and our
solution, adresses, numbers, etc. And word it so maybe some parents with
clout($, greased hands, hit men...) can get on their case.

Wait and see. If shit happens, post it. Well air mail the turd back to them.....

That's my spittle,

Oh, this is where you are very, very wrong, my friend.

There are MANY MANY 18-21 year old ravers (such as my 20 year old self),
and most of us are those that "really care enough".  I do give (a lot more
than) half of a rat's ass about what politicians do to directly affect my
rights as a voting, draft-bound citizen of this country.

The ravers that don't care are the ones that I find don't care about a lot
of others things in their life too.

Speak for yourself.

I called the line and left the promoters a message as an IMPORTANT reminder
to put age information in their recording for when its updated.

I don't want people trying to go to the Trocadero and find out that it
might be 21+ only!  It might be 18+, but WE wouldn't know that until we get
to the door would we?

It is true that providing good sound for 2000 people is a lot harder, but
I think Martin spends alot of money to get very good sound at his parties.
All his big parties I've been to have had very clean & VERY BIG sound that
rattle your insides out. I was hoping to go to the next F&F, but this is a
once a year thing and I know there will be plenty more F&F's. Last year
was a "real rave", hopefully this year will match it.

Stompy Stomp should be a cool party... Doc Martin just got back from a huge

he picked up on the way.

Yes the 17th sounds like a tough decision.  All's I know is that Wicked at

Now if only spending lots of money were all it took to get great sound..... 

Martin uses a sound contractor who is *very good* and has excellent (the
best really) gear; but that doesn't necesarilly solve the problem. 

For instance, that same contractor did sound for the last Basics which was
generally agreed upon to have had horrid sound; tony himself told me he
thought it sounded terrible, as did I. Two huge stacks were aimed down the
short axis of a room; in adddition to which the main visual screens were
hung directly in front of the stacks nearly *eliminating* the high end.
There was no stereo imaging, general muddiness, lack of punch, etc. 

Another example is the trocadero. Everyone agrees that the sound system
itself (ie the drivers, positioning, etc.) there, are excellent, HOWEVER,
more often than not it too sounds like shit. I was at a Basics there, too,
where people were *leaving* becasue it sounded so bad (seriously painful
distortion across the full spectrum)...

The real problem is that a sound contractor's suggestions quite often play
second fiddle to "The Way the Promoter Wants to Stage the Party" ie, where
the djs go, where the visuals go etc.; I personally have experienced this
on numerous occasions.

On the other hand, the first Basics finale at the Richmod Civic had
*awesome* sound; it was in effect two four corner systems:

XX           XXX           XX
X             X             X

       o             o


X             X             X
XX           XXX           XX

Speakers at 'X'
Stereo Sweet Spots at o

This was awesome :)

The most significant factor is the room itself and the postiioning of the
drivers within it. The best pile of magnets can still sound like shit if
quality of sound is not the concern that drives the staging of the given
event. Sound Vision in the back room at komotion sounds phenomenal because
that room was post-designed (by sound engineers) to sound great; it is,
after all, a recording studio -- there are bass traps in every corner,
acoustical tile across the whole cieling. etc. The room has an amazing
compression (in 3d too; from the balcony the sound is even better!) and,
after more than 6 mos working that room, we've got speaker positioning and
EQing down cold...

Just mu $.02

see ya

hey everyone,

  Well last night i was hoping to make it to my first kinetic party
but it ended up in a bad spot.
  After chilling out for a few hours, bryan, jan, ernie, paul, and
jamie, and i  found the location from the party had been moved from Berkeley
to San Francisco.  It was going to be held at the warehouse right
on the bay where Pacific and Kinetic were both last weekend.
  We were one of the first people at the sight and there were three
other kids there and the two guys setting up the sound system when
the cops came. 
  We were all inside the warehouse and waited inside
to see if they would maybe go away but instead more cop cars came
and they made their way to the warehouse where they promptly pronounced
the party was over.  We thought that would be the end of it but since
there was only ten of us there the cops had their fun with us and
took all of our id's and ran them threw the computer to see if we
had a record.  Intimidation and all.  
  One kid was worried because he had a ticket out for his skateboard
but they let him go on the promise that he'd pay the ticket.  One
of the guys who was throwing it disappeared though when he found
out they were checking id's. a warrent for arrest or something.

  After leaving we made it back to the map point to see if there 
was any information but just a bunch of disapointed ravers.  ernie
pointed out that a lot of the kids looked like they were under 18
and that it was good they weren't there cause of the curfew law
(the cops back at the sight did ask us if we were under 18)
  Also the guys who were throwing it didnt come out from their house
and say anything so everyone there didnt know what was happening. 
I think that was rather lame.  They could have at least come out
and explained the situation, but i guess they were afraid they would
loose the $5 each they collected from people.
  So after a late dinner at the Video Cafe we called it a night

peace

I know that I posted this party but I also posted a warning
as I found things were not as I thought. Perhaps I should have been
more negative since I was to spin first and I had to call the
voice mail and go to the map point to find out that the party was
going to 20th and illinois. I dont like break ins since im on parole.

The kenetic guys arent going anywhere and Im sure das,corbin and 
sometimes david will throw another next friday...

I just called the EPIC line (408.457.4955) for information about a possible
Santa Cruz party (which Elmo just posted about an hour ago), in hopes of
finding something to do tonight.

In the recording, mention is made of other party happenings tonight.

One of the parties mentioned was Wicked, at the Trocadero, and 18+.


18+ ??  If this is true, then I must go!  Being a mere youngling of 20
years, I am ordinarily not elder enough to pass in the Wicked zone with the
regular age restrictratory level being 21 years.

Does anyone have any way of finding out whether 18+ people will be allowed
in for this Wicked tonight?  I called the Wicked number (415.512.5713), but
there is no hint as to which it will be.

Wicked is 18+ or 21+ tonight?

Excuse me, but I care a fuck of a lot about this, that is why I put it in the
faces of the 21+ (which it seems sfraves is mostly made up of). I think
you missunderstood me, I am 19 & was trying to say that most 21+ would not
be motivated enough to do anything about this. I was hoping that would
catch some peoples attention & maybe give em' some juice to prove me
wrong. Giving them some pitifull plea aint gonna do shit.

I don't understand why promoters feel a need to run against Martin on this
night. It seems very disrespectable to him & the scene to throw a party
that could happen any time, on a date where we should be celebrating a
party that has had major effects on this scene. I don't give a fuck about
any qualms with the promoter, it's all about the party. This is one of
them that has a chance at kickin people in the ass and reminding them of why
they are still going to parties, oppurtunities like this don't come around
all that often. It seems to me that if you are going to parties for the
"scene" then you should be able to drop all that "I'm too cool for big
parties","Martin's a millionaire" (which he most definatley is not),"I only
go to 21+ parties" bullshit  attitude. I don't think F&F purposely decided
to run against him, as I know they've had their date set for a while, but
it's unfortunate that there will be some realy cool people missing from
both parties.

Ethan i'm sure it's flatering for you to think that someone has purposely
taken your name for feindish promotional tactics but it's just not true.
The descriptive phrase "family'n'friends" can be and has been used by many
different party's groups including our's. The fact of the matter is that
each party has it's own unique flavor that is not solely defined by it's
title. I've taken a look at your invite and I doubt that anyone will
confuse the parties, they have two completely different flavors from music
all the way down. I hope there are no harsh feelings and i'm sure that all
events on that night shall be nothing less than great. I don't suscribe to
the paper that says we are competing, we are all saying the same thing we
just decide to define it differently to sastisfy our own personal creative
taste.

Well, "freestyle dance music" just means the kind that Harry, Doc,
John and Thomas play!  Anyway, I met a couple of friends yesterday in
Berkeley who were helping flyer for this event.  Looks like a good
lineup and a good party.  It may also cut down on F&F attedance, but
I'm not too worried about that.  The flyer and poster design for this
are very nice, btw . . .

Freestyle is basically an east coast post-disco pop/dance music offshoot.
I think there are generally considered to be two substyles, Miami (or
Florida generally) and New York.  Lotsa vocals, Latin influence, slick
production but good for dancing.  Sorta like the original garage house
styles, I think.  I haven't heard much freestyle, but I know it was
quite popular in the late 1980s.  There's still quite a bit around, but
Dance Music Authority, a DJ magazine out of the Midwest, is on a constant
campaign to revive the style, especially on radio (which is cool, I like
it when magazines have a certain point of view built into their approach
instead of taking the trade rag "objectivity" stance).  

Anyway, unless I'm mistaken Stompy will not be four well-known house DJs
playing that kind of freestyle all night . . . although with the Good
Doctah, yah nevah know :)

My recollection is that the last BART going north gets to the Coliseum
right at midnight.  But Ethan's right, sometimes they run late trains
for big events.  I took BART to the Thursday show but got a ride out
so I don't know the way they'll handle it tonight.

On the F&F/Gathering/Stompy tip, and as one of the DJs involved :)
simply let me say that SF has a chance to prove it can throw three
kickin' parties on the same evening and I am optimistic it will turn
out that way.  They are large-medium-small, the crews are good, and
the crowds overlap but not all that much.  Most important, all three
have proven track records as vibe-oriented events.  If SF can't handle
this situation, what I mean to say is, if WE can't handle this situation,
how can we ever expect the scene to grow and thrive?  

Now my only question is, where are all of us meeting later for the 
combined after-party!

In some seriousness, though, of course it means that attendance at one or
all may be down some because of the other events.  But this kind of
scheduling overlap is bound to happen, and I think this is indicative of a
scene that really is opening up again instead of having dates parceled
out among a small clutch of promotional groups as has been the case.
Finally, it puts a little more of a premium on promoting each party
for the next week, which means a little extra effort to bring in the
people and sustain the quality and energy.

And that's *my* $0.02 for today . . .

Preston:

I certainly wouldn't go so far as to say that I took it as "fiendish
promotional tactics", however, I *do* think it's in rather poor taste. 

Sure the sentiment may be shared across the scene, and yes, I really don't
think we're competing, but the specific use of the sentiment "Friends and
Family" *as a name* is the trademark of the party I and others have been
throwing for a year now -- and you know that; I personally gave you a flier
for one (which you complimented me on!) six months ago. Bottom line I think
you could have easily expressed that sentiment without resorting to the
phrase "Family 'n Friends".  

And as far as flattery goes; I was anything but flattered. How would you
feel if I'd thrown a "Boogie Brunch" on a sunday morning across from you;
you'd be pissed and don't tell me you wouldn't.

Ultimately, it's not that big a deal and, no, there are no harsh feelings. 
We all are, after all, Friends & Family.

Just as a matter of historical fact, we picked this date in May of last
spring, and I sent Martin email with our *entire schedule* spring, summer, 
and fall at the time.

As far as not "going up against 'x', I have to take serious exception with
this. There is a wicked every month; there is a basics, a vision or a
gathering (same promoter different brand) regularly; there is a funky tekno
tribe an organic or, now, a futur (same promoter different brand)
regularly; there is a Stompy Production fairly regularly; there is a Cool
World Presents 'x' regularly. If all the smaller promoters simply lay down
and die so they won't "go up against" one of the bigger promoters there
aren't any weekends left in the year!

And what if we're sick of hearing the same DJs we've heard for the last 
3 years? Martin told me he was gonna start breaking in some new DJs 
*at this party* looks like the same old, same old to me. And I'm not
criticising them (or him) they are *great* djs, no question. Tony is still
one of my all time favorite djs; Jon Williams plays plenty of music I like;
and yes its' true I even like Jeno upon occasion :)

BUT:

What if we're sick of paying $15, $20 or $25?

What if we prefer to party with 300 people instead of 3000?

Waht if we prefer to party with people of *all* ages.

What if we want to hear *TECHNO!*

No, I'm sorry, we have an obligation to provide an alternative to all of
the above ON THE SAME NIGHT else, it's not, there's not, an *alternative*.
And alternatives, diversity, CHOICES (pun intended!) are essential to the
overall health of everything; this scene included.

And lets remember that a little competition helps ease the strain on our

I wasn't trying to say that you shouldn't run against Martin or big
parties, but I thought an exception should be made for a party that can
only happen on one day of the year. I was also trying to say that I
thought people should drop their personal preferances and go for the
community. The Gathering is not just any old party, it has had more
influence on the scene than anything else but Wicked/FMR, I don't think
people should never run against it, but for the 3 year anniversary, yes an
exception should definatly be made. I personaly usualy don't like big
parties all that much, my music of choice is acid-house (NOWHERE to go for
this, except home), I have some dissagriances with (but much respect) for
the way Martin has thrown parties as of late and I hate that new color
flier :) . I am dropping all this because I personaly think other people
and myself should go to this party for the scene & nothing else, $20 aint
a helluva' lot to pay for probably one of the more important things in
your life. You can't deny that there are serious problems with the scene
today. In my opinion most people newer to the scene are not given the
oppurtunity that most of us got to find out what it's all about (yeah it's
subjective, but I think the "vibe" works for most of us), if there are
enough people who know, those that don't will learn (maybe not all that
fast, but they will very quickly find out it aint about throwin'
attitude). In my opinion small parties don't work that well for this,
usualy these kind of people feel left out while everybody else seems to
have an incredible connection to oneanother. The only way to teach them is
with big parties, the problem is most of us don't have the patience to go
to these gangster-attitude infested parties and spread the "vibe". I know
there will be lots of old-timers at the Gathering, whether there will be
enough to have the energy to drop the "too cool" attitude is unknown to
me, all I can do is hope & bring lot's of energy with me.  regards,

this is just a little message to say "hi" and also:  how was wicked?
i wish i could've gone...*sigh*  once again, school n' stuff have
interferred with raving adventures.

i'm REALLY looking forward to F&F, 'cause it will be (i hope) an event
featuring the Sfraves tribe from all over.  last time i went i met a guy
up for the weekend from LA, mostly just to go to this party.  this party
is yet another example of how the party's name MAKES the party in some
subtle way.  everyone was FRIENDLY and i felt like i was among FAMILY. 
cool!

i also love the collective organic atmosphere at F&F, just like i love
the total blow-out spare-no-expense production (lasers lasers everwhere!)
at gathering parties.  but i *know* the sound will be tweaked to perfection
at Kommotion...sfravers are just so technophilic!  also, i've been hearing
about improvements at Kommotion that are making it into the perfect club
that's not a club!  such as: a big fan for the ceiling to suck out hot air?
has it happened?

i sense an element of tension in some of the posts concerning the three
raves happening sat night... my 2cents:  the event you are planning is
going to happen..everything is in motion...it's not any one person's 
responsibility anymore.  try not to worry because it's going to happen the
way it wants to.  just get ready to experience it!

wish me luck, please:  i only have two days to finish my electron microscopy
class AND go to some seminars at a conference in SF.  but after that, i can
come out to play...i bet a lot of you are deep in finals right now.  GOOD
LUCK!

seeyou saturday, i hope,

The decision of which party to go to on Dec. 17th probably took 
me less than a second to choose.  I have been going to the 
Gathering parties since the beginning, and I wouldn't miss an 
anniversary for the world.  I need someone to do a review to be 
included in the packs of Screen Savers that I make.  I'd like 
to have a text file about the party to go along with all of the 
pictures.  If anyone is interested in typing one out, let me 
know.  Must have good english, a good knowledge of the music, 
dj's, etc, and a veteran to the scene.  I'd do it myself, but 
it would just take me longer to release, and I hate writing 
reviews.  SO, if you'd like to get in on the SFRSS action, let 
me know.  I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there on 
Saturday.  I'll be running around with Cool World keychains for 
all of you.  See you all soon...

                               ^^^^or maybe a HOOOOWLLL! A-OOOOOOOH!

 After going dancedless for a month , I got a lot of home chores done , 
but I'd also developed a severe itch for some techno body joy. 
 So , this Sunday , I was ready to do the Atomic Dog thing! I drove up to 
San Francisco and Berkeley to do some Christmas shopping , and then I
made it to the Oakland Coliseum parking lot by 4:30PM. After eating my
Chinese take-out dinner in my truck , I ventured out into the intermittent
drizzle , my ears straining to catch the odd snatch of thumpa-thumpa.
This was complicated by the presence of various drum circles ( plus points 
to them for playing in the rain ) and car stereo systems playing Grateful
Dead tunes. 
 I met Robert at about 5:50 PM , and we both went on the search , but no 
success . He had to go phone some friends , so I went back to my truck
to leave - this was about 6:20. 
 But - hey! What's that I hear , way over at the other end of the lot?
Like a shark following a blood trail , I tracked the sound of techno to
Atomic Dog ! Gil was mixing something tasty - it was the first time I can 
recall seeing him spin . 
 It was great to see familiar faces again - Ethan , Bryce , the Normals ,
Sun , and other folks ! I had to leave somewhat early in consideration of
getting to work today , but I hope things went well after I left. 
 See you folks at Friends and Family and Stompy!

 PS - I hear a new thing for sale at the Coliseum parking lot - "nuggets".
      What the heck is that?

Isn't it typical?  Just as soon as one person gets a good idea everybody 
wants to get into the act.  And this is how Ethen must feel.  He was one 
of the original people who founded the whole house  scene in SF and the 
night he is about to throw a party that was one of the fore-father's of 
the whole scene only to have a number of key people, who would still be 
mucking around doing lame punk shows if it had not been for him (Ethen) 
plkaying at their first parties.  Now most people would get a knighthood 
for this but instead all we get are rival parties on hte same night by 
stealing other people's ideas left right and center.  A scene is not 
founded on money but on mutual self-respect and it seems to be totally 
lacking.  In short, Ethen is experiencing the fact that most people 
involved in the rave scene in sf are a bunch of un-loyal, 
diss-respectable, money grabbing indidviduals who could not give a fuck 
about their fellow raver or their fellow promoter/DJ.  People are 
shitting on you Ethen and that is very slack.
As far as having more then one major party on the same night this is 
tricky in a city as small as San Fransisco because people's money is 
limmited as well as the fact that the music will be the same (or very 
similer) at all the different parties.  We could get away with having 
lots of major parties on the same night in London because it is a bigger 
town, there are lots of different music scenes and people would know taht 
the music at each of the different parties would be different where as 
here, because the scene is much more compact, it is far more difficult to 
do.  I'm not saying that the music or the dj's are better in London (I 
acctually think that the music here is better then it is in London) but 
the scene is deffinatly more diverse so it can, therefore, handle many 
different house scenes which can not really be done.  All the parties 
happening on that night will be small, under attended affairs and this 
will not do anyone, any favours and this is sad.  In short, 
nobody is going to win from this, especially Ethen, and other's 
(like money grabbing promoter's who have about as much interest and 
knowledge on the "scene" as the size of their bank ballance) should have 
more respect for their elders and better's and be safe in the knowledge 
that your average raver is so musically ignorant that as long as you 
have lots of flashing lights and eighteen and over door policy you'll 
pack them in from miles around regaurdless of the fact that they heard 
all of this music last week.  But then what do I know?
Yours with deep respect for Ethen,
Mr.Trippy.

Excuse me? Why is this? I'd be willing to bet a fair amount of $$$ that the
exact anniversary of the first Gathering was not December 17th. I may be
wrong but this is awfully melodramatic....

>I was also trying to say that I

So the Gathering is the only source of *real* community for this scene?
Come on. The Gathering happens twice a year, once for the 4th of July and
once for it's Yearly Anniversary. If this is all that's holding our
community together, we're in trouble.

More influence than anything else? Do you *really* think that?

I *beg* to disagree here! PLenty 'o' acid house to be found around SF :)

Au Contraire! Not even common sense supports this conclusion...But then,
clearly, I'm arguing with mythology now which is always a bad decision :)

I really appreciate the support, but I'd hardly call myself a founder of

Preston, who's doing Stompy Stomp, was one of the promoters involved in
Toon Town.  So in a way he's still going against The Gathering. :-)

Personally, I'll be at all three parties next weekend.

I can't even remember what any Gathering I went to was like. Or if I even
went. Big parties are pretty generic for me.

However smaller unique ones are always remembered,

Getting Down and Wicked this weekend
====================================

This Friday,   I heard rumor that Kinetic was supposed to have a two
room gig on Friday evening,   somewhere in E. Bay.   But I called the
number and it gave out the usual Haight St map point.    I certainly 
wasn't going to go across the Golden Gate Br (And pay $3 toll) just
to go over to the E. Bay,  so I hung around at home until I found
out where it would be.   Later on,  my friends tell me that it's been
cancelled,   and the rest is history.

This Saturday,   WICKED,  plain and simple.   Legendary in it's own way,
as it always manages to bring together the best VIBE on the scene.    

Thanx to Craig and Dennise,   I get to go with someone else,   so I can
indulge in mind altering thingies.

We arrive early,   no line to speak of,   and as I handed the ticket
lady my $20 bill,   I was expecting $5 back but got $10.    WOW!!   I
actually get the reduced price.   

Markie was just getting warmed up,   while I spent some time schmoozing
with Bill and Gaby.   I also met Ravinbird...   Among quite a few new
SFRravers.  

The Chill zone wasn't set up yet,   so as people were coming in,   I was
schmoozing with friends.   Markie hadn't quite yet got the energy level
to critical mass,  but that gave me more time to say hi to friends.

About an hour into Markies set,   I headed for the dance floor.    By that
time,   about a hundred or so were tearing it up.    It's been a while since
I've heard Markie spin,   and was quite pleased to hear a lot of new stuff.

About 1 am,   I was really getting off big time....   as I found a "Sweet
spot" where the sound was just perfect,   and boogied my ass off.    Thought
I died and went to rave heaven....!!   I did my usual thing...   Gave everyone
my energy and love,  got lots of smiles back...   

AS the evening progressed,   Jeno went on and schredded my brains all over
the Troc...   Yow!!   --   Finally,   Tomas went on with some rather strange
mix of really slow stuff and (Yummy drool!) Jungle....   By that time,
most people were just standing around,   trying to decide if they want to
dance to it or not.    Willy Wong and a few other SFRavers tore it up...

Eventually,   things progressed down into the "Housey" relm once again,   as
6 am was slowly approaching,  I decided to dance until the music stopped.

Hmmmm!!   6:30 and still no end to the music?   So I headed to one of the
Troc doormen and asked when it was supposed to end...   He said 8 am...  
Immediately,  I had the biggest grin on my face.....(Oh!  Goodie,   2 more
hours),   so headed out to dance once again to get as much out of the
last two hours of the rave as I could.   Dancing pretty much all the time
at this point,   except to get water and an ocassional cooling off 

I've still got a big fat smile on my face.....   Wonderful party...

Lookin forward to Friends and Family....  although I might stop by the
Gathering First...   Martin wants a WWW site set up....  Then after 
everything is running OK,  I'll probably schmooze around,   dance a few
sets,  and head back to F&F.

C. Crunch  :-)

Okay I think we're all getting a little carried away here...

The Friends & Family, Stompy family and friends controversy:
        This has all been taken WAY out of context, one is the name of a
party, one refers to a group of people.  The party Friends and Family has
been around for about a year, the circle of people and their extended
family known as the Stompy family and friends has also existed for at least
a year.  I'm sure we can all produce documentation to back up these facts.
The fact of the matter is that it doesn't seem like it's very much in the
spirit of friendliness and family to argue about this.
        We all need to stop dissecting every party before it happens and
just go with open minds to a show and let what happens happen.  If we all
only went to a party that had big, glossy four-color fliers then we'd all
miss the feeling we get at small parties when you're surrounded by a close,
grooving circle of people all on the same wavelength as you.  And if we all
only went to small, intimate parties we'd all miss that feeling of awe you
get when you walk into a cavernous space and feel like you've stepped into
another world.  There's  many points between these two extremes, and many
flavors of party as well.  But the simple idea behind everything is that
you're supposed to have a good time.
        It's not up to a flier to tell you how a party will be, or what the
night has in store for you.  It's up to you, to go and find that out for
yourself.  There really isn't that much confusion between parties, everyone
has carved out their niche and everyone else is pretty much aware of those
niches.  I mean if I had two fliers, one for "The Gathering", and another
for "A gathering of friends - Reunion Groove" I think I'd give myself and
most other people enough credit as to be able to discern between the two.
        We've all got a great thing going, and part of what makes it so
great is the diversity.  But let's not forget unity in the sake of
diversity.

Just my .02

Love,
matt

Hi All,

Well, if I'm not sleeping through parties these days,(I knew I shouldn't have
had that last birthday) it looks like I am missplacing them entirely. Sat.
Nite-after an X-mas party (without the X) I stuffed myself with on a
Chrisatmas dinner fit for Charles Dickens. Dropping off my ever lovely and
luscious dinner companion about midnight, I was falling asleep at the wheel
before I could make it out of Carmel, and even think about making it to
Wicked.

Ah Ha!!! I'll sleep and go to Atomic Dog tomorrow, and see everyone!!!!
Leaving Monterey at 2:00--The sun was shining, my spirits were bright.
Something told me to check my mail before I left, and YES...There were the
new Doran and Jon Howard tapes I had ordered from Ameba (Thanks Allen) I hit
San Jose, and rains came a tumblin down. This does not bode
well.........since I forgot to bring an umbrella......

(Run, DO NOT walk to Ameba to buy the Doran tape!!!!!!!!)

Any Hees......I cast myself into the Deadhead bazaare--A marketplace of the
multifarious-Guys bummping into you, muttering under their breath "Gunga
Brownies, Acid, Coke,
......Nuggetts" Always good to see youthful capitalism raising
its ugly head.....Putting America first.....I put my rave ears on, and kept
listening for Thumpa, Thumpa.....As Larry Ching and I walked around.....We
would think we heard something, walk in that direction, only to find some
maniacal bongo player, or someone's car stereo blasting. Alas, I decide to
find a phone.  For a while, as the hawkers and barker were saying "Wicked
Ale, Bong Pipes, Tye-Dye underwear, etc." I retorted, "Cellular, or Can I
rent a Car Phone?"-to which I received a host of "Get lost Yuppie Scum,"
looks.

Not finding a phone or Thumpa Thumpa....I went to Sam's Hofrau
and had a great roast beef dinner.

Continuing in "The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste or Get Wasted"---I
walked around to where I thought I had parked my car.  GONE!!!!! The sign
said, "No Parking-Sat.9:00-^6:00"--

Shit or Shinola!!!! I called the impound yard, where they told me
they hadn't received my car.  The crack dealers on the corner I walked by
(Why weren't they in the Parking lot?) told me I shouldn't have left a BMW on
the streets around there. I stumbled around in the rain, and the dark for
another hour until
I found my car......just where I had hidden it. I had a party in the car, on
the way home with Doran. I think I'll take a cab to F&F.
Now, where is Kommotion again?

So ends the tale of 1 Lost Dawg.......Where was the party, and how the hell
was it???????       robertj...... monterey

We should really try to get away from the phrase "go against"; I am in no
sense "against" the Gathering in any way shape or form; I've always thought
the scene needed great massives *as well as* smaller parties and Martin
does massives better than anyone else, bar none; if I didn't happen to be
throwing a party the same night, I would most certainly be at the Gathering
--  unless of course there was a good techno/trance party available that
night in which case I'd prolly op for that alternative which is why I like
and think we need alternatives: they allow *me* to choose what *I* want...

Aha!  There is where you are wrong.  FnF will have mostly trance and 
techno and ambient, the Gathering will have what you'd expect from the 
lineup, and Stompy will have freestyle.  I'm sure there will be 
individual songs played at more than one party, but musical preference 
can definitely be a factor in your decision.

Ethan, you took the words righ right of my editor...

Try not to think of these parties as going *against* one another.  Each 
event is simply offering its version of a house party.

It's like going to Double Rainbow and having 3 falvors to choose from 
instead of 1.  I think the only unfortunate thing about the synchronicity 
of these 3 events is that they will *ALL* go off and I can't be in three 
places at once.

I know many cities that would drool for any one of these parties.  We 
should be thankful to have all of them.

 Niether rain nor sleet nor dead of night ... Oh wait a minute thats
the post office isn't it. Atomic Dog didn't have sleet and I like 
dancing in the dead of night, but rain we had, ranging from intermitant
showers to a full on down poor at the end. 
 The first thing I have to say is to everyone that can came out to the 
party, thank you, you made it a terrific party. Ravers amaze me and make
grin :-) people were there and dancing right from the get go and the
crowd grew and held well untill Garth wound it up at right about twelve 
in a timely (considering the weather) mannor and after an excelent set.
 As I said Garths set was excelent, his vibe was sweet and with an
occasional
draining there was just enough room for him to stand under the tarp over the
dj booth (thats a draining of the tarp, not Garth). Thank you Garth.
Tracy my favorite up and comer dj wise, good work, try and not dance
while she's spinning, I dare ya. :-). Look for her on New Years Eve.
Ethan a little funkier than usual,I liked it I liked it. I'm looking forward
to hearing him agian and the time after that too. We know your going to spin
at
Friends and Family, did you also mention you had a slot on News Years?
Gil, thats me I'm biased, I like my records, I also haven't spun in public
much and I think it shows, but I got some fine mixes and in my best work is 
ahead of me. So come out early to Friends and Family and see what you think.
 Sound Vision and crew, again thanks to Ethan and Bryce who with the
floating 
volinteers, among them Phred and Monica, made it sound good.
  Thanks to the woman with the hot tea for us while we tore down.
 And last but not least kudos to M and P-ter Normal, they have been involved
in putting on all the Atomics and M has been pointwoman for the last three, 
arranging for djs, sound, transport, fliers and all that goes into putting
on 
a party. If everything pans out that they have in the works for the next one
all I can say is whou doggie is it going to be fun, the next one by the way
is
Atomic Pig.

I went to wicked and I thought all the djs were good the sound was good 
the chill room needed pillows. I guess they only used part of the wicked
system and that worked. I had to laugh at the sheer number of people who 
asked to be let in free or pay less, It seemed almost compulsive,..Its 
true we are all special....   

Atomic Dog was incredible and the dead head vibe is liberating as they 
encourage full on freakout dancing and psychedelic energy. It was very 
wet and I really want to thank ethan for risking his system for the 
benifit of raveheads .  

I must say I like lots of freaks around when I'm gonna freak out.

on sat dec. 17th theres a party in my pants and...
salutations, allen@ameba

"Brilliant, right, thanks for calling the Wicked line...."

Wicked at the Troc is definitely a sure winner in my book.  
Ya gots yer spacious main dance flo' 
Ya gots yer stage for watching the sea of people sway and grind into oblivion
Ya gots yer upstairs ambient chill zone which sometimes pumps faster 
beats than the main flo' (not a porblem)
Ya gots yer skylights to brighten up the atmosphere in the morning and 
keep everyone going til the end.  
Ya gots yer pool table.  (Although paying 15 bux and then playing pool 
doesn't seem like a value)

Sound system - I was standing in front of stage right speaker and I'm
guessing they only send the medium to high frequencies to that one, cuz
all I heard from it was chick'ing sounds in sync with loud booms and more
melodic sounds coming from the opposite side of the room.  Maybe it was my
fresh earplugs attenuating the sounds more than my usual grungy ones...
But the good thing was that it wasn't too loud. 

I dug the fast fast fast Thomas stuff, but the extended mix version 
seemed too much.  People had this look on their faces : "Where is my 
HOUSE, bring it on BABY I want it NOW".  Well it took awhile but 
eventually the door opened and we were all let back into the HOUSE.

The vibe was great.  Lots of goodness all around.  There was a gentleman 
there named Micheal acting as smile enforcer... Right on.  I also met a 
couple, Greg and Melissa who were making friends left and right, 
spooshing them with sparkles.  Where else can you do this!

Computer cops at 'U' homed in on Apple Valley hacker
By Jim Adams
Staff Writer
 
University of Minnesota computer sleuths
tracked an Apple Valley teenager for about
six weeks - watching him illegally use their
passwords to gain access to more than 10
computer networks from Detroit to Moscow
- before police confiscated his computer
Monday.
 
They monitored the 15-year-old as he
bragged electronically to other computer
hackers about his escapades.  That included
forcing the Greater Detroit Free-Net to shut
down for a week after he penetrated its secu-
rity in an attempt to use the system without
anyone knowing.
 
But the university computer techs knew.
What's more, they say, the boy brazenly told
other hackers, as the techs electronically
eavesdropped, that he knew that they knew
- and thought it was funny.
 
"He didn't care that he was being watched,
and it seemed he almost wanted to be
caught," Frank Grewe, a university computer
manager, said Friday.  He said the youth, who
lives with his mother and did much of his
mischief in the early-morning hours, was
hospitalized, possibly for psychological rea-
sons, when police confiscated his computer
modem and software programs Monday.
 
Apple Valley police investigators could not
be reached Friday, but Dakota County Attor-
ney James Backstrom said the boy could face
felony charges for breaking into computer
systems.
 
"He wiped out a lot of critical files," said
Paul Raine, president of the Detroit Free-
Net, an eight-month-old community infor-
mation exchange that charges no fees to its
users.
 
[Page #2]
 
Hacker/ He used computer as much as 20 hours a day
 
University officials notified Raine
the morning after the youth penetrat-
ed their network security, Grewe
said.  The system was shut down
Nov. 9 so volunteers could rebuild it
and tighten security.  Raine said he
has contacted the FBI about possible
federal charges because the youth 
used telecommunications equipment
to reach across state lines.
 
Grewe said police told him the youth
had problems at home and had been
skipping school while using his com-
puter as much as 20 hours a day to
gain access to electronic mail systems
and computer data files worldwide.
He said other high school students
had been involved, at least one of
whom would be prosecuted if he re-
sumed unauthorized use of universi-
ty passwords.
 
He said the Apple Valley youth had
obtained passwords, possibly from
Twin Cities electronic bulletin
boards or by using commercially
available decoding programs.  He said
the university has more than 100,000
computer users, including students,
staff and alumni.
 
The first step when an unauthorized
user is detected is to change the pass-
word to one more difficult to crack,
Grewe said.
 
"He had a whole pocketful of them,"
Grewe said.  "We would change a
password, and he'd use another.  For
a while, we were closing one account
a day on this kid.  Most people would
get the clue we are watching and they
disappear.  But he just kept coming
back and trying to break into other
systems.
 
"He had enough knowlege to make
himself dangerous, but not enough to
hide his tracks. ... My staff would
come in in the morning and say, `Oh,
Lord, look what he did last night.'
After a few nights it became, `We
have to find out where he lives and
what he is up to.'"
 
Authorities traced the boy's tele-
phone line.  After obtaining enough
logs of his unauthorized activities -
including the Detroit caper - police
went to his home with a search war-
rant.
 
Grewe said the boy appeared to fit
the typical hacker profile: a 15- to 20-
year-old male, many who have 
low self-esteem.  "He really could use
a girlfriend instead of a computer,"
Grewe said.
 
Olaf Holt, president of the fledgling
Twin Cities FREE-NET, which is
raising funds to go public, said com-
puter hackers have their own subcul-
ture: "They pride themselves on their
ability to break into otherwise-re-
stricted spaces," especially highly se-
cure government systems.
 
Holt said hears of hacker crack-
ing a computer network's security
system every few months.  But it is
unusual for a network that offers free
access to be attacked.  Holt said most
of the world's 40 free networks are in
the United States; the first opened in
Cleveland in 1986.
 
"It is not as common for a free net to
go down, because most people think
of it as a community good, and as
such, they don't get many points in
view of their peers" for sabotaging it,
Holt Said.

>yeah... yeah.. wicked was ok...sorta mebbe awesome.. :)
>sumptin' missin tho'... dont know what it was...

Brian, I agree that "sumptin' missin tho'... dont know what it was..."  But
I think it was lack of good Music.

All of you wicked die hards, was this a regular wicked (music, vibe, energy)?

See, this was my first flight into WICKED and for some reason the winds
were blowing in strange ways.  I lost a few feathers right away and crashed
pretty early.   Mind you before my spin out I had a wonderful time meeting
with many SFRavers (you know who you are) great, great bunch of people. :)
:)

Markie's set was fine even very good for awhile.  I really was into dancing
from the minute I flew in.  Dancing in the middle of the dance floor was
great and this guy (I forget your name) coached the crowd into going wild,
howling and yelling....Aaooooww!  A couple of times I thought I had reached
heaven.

That was it though.  The wind currents did not hold up, there were no more
uplifts, my flight pattern went irratic...I lost altitude and that was it.
I left for fresh air.

What I'm saying is the music sucked after that.  I enjoy good house music
but this was lame.  Very low music energy.  Maybe my expectations were too
high, maybe I was tricked by the foX......

Oh well!  Not upset but a little disapointed.  Do let me know if this was
regular for Wicked???

I feel lucky to have such a broad range of parties to choose;  knowing that
each party has the potential to blow my doors off!  I think things could be a

etc...granted ethan and the others have valid points...i'm not bashing anyone
here.  I'm simply saying that "fuck, there is no place else I'd rather rave!

Hmmm... (digs into old flier box) Saturday Dec.14'th 1991, are you saying
that he has to have it on wednesday the 14'th for it to be a valid
anniversary, if you did an F&F anniversary would you do it on the exact
date or the friday or saturday closest to the date, I am quite sure you'd
do the latter.

Did I say that? I dont think so. Well the finale was in 4/92, so
technicaly it's supposed to be over. I beleive the only Gatherings that
have happened since then were the anniversary's, one small free one &
Gathering presents (L.F.R. & Vision). Martin has since moved on to Basics
and played a major roll in an unbelievable amount of small mostly $ losers
in 93.

What do you want me to go back further, I think that's kind of pointless
as it has been mutated beyond recognition since than. Yeah, there were
other major contributors (Destiny, Community, Toontown, Equinox, Sharon),
two of which were part of the original Gatherings, but I'd say Martin has
probably had more influence. You could easily argue that the
majority of the current scene was more influenced by Wally/Cool world & FTT 
and unfortunatly you'd probably be right.

Yeah, if going down to Ameoba & buying "House Reality" counts as plenty.
People have a very warped sense of what is what, acid-house is one of the
few things that is not to hard for those that know to classify. Most
people can't tell the difference between real 90% pre-90 (no midi
used) rough acid & acid-trance (or whatever the hell you want to call it) 
Could you please tell me of any good acid-house dj's or parties because
I've been searching for years & have yet to find any consistent ones.

Gee, I didn't know I was a fucking mythologist. Are you telling me you
wouldn't feel uncomforatable if you went to some small hip-hop party were
there was nobody but your two friends that looked or acted remotely like
you and they all seemed to be have their own lingo that was no where near
your reality & to top it off they seemed to treat you like outsiders. Now
let's change the situation. You go to a big party where there are all
kinds of people there, some of them kinda like you, most of them not, but
you don't feel like a total outsider anymore, there is definatly something
very different going on, but you kinda got a feel for it now. Unfortunatly
most of the big parties now are a bad representation of the real thing &
we mostly recruit people who think that it's all about Cool World, FTT & a
hit of E (sorry for the not always true generalization). Alot of the
people who have it in them are going to miss out. If I wasn't lucky enough
to be introduced to it 3yrs ago through some good big parties, I'd probably be
one of those people who thought raves were for stupid people to listen to
"The Prodigy" & get high. There are very few parties that can manage to
have a "vibe" & be big and non-threatening for outsiders. IMH the reason
being that most people that "know what it's about" are to fucking selfish
& lazy to risk going to a big party and trying to spread the vibe. 
	
	I'm not arguing against small parties and diversity among them, as
they are extremely important to the scene. But we have lost touch with the
bigger ones which play an equaly important part & let the $ hungry
promoters and the stupid idea of being too cool for big parties get the
better of us.

actually.. very much so..in fact it may have been one of the better ones :)
(now I bet THAT makes u wonder, denis :)
I'm not sure when u left (as usual :), but garth came on after that, followed byjeno and then thomas... and the energy certainly exploded as time went on. 
I believe that it reached a critical mass sometime in garths set (imo)..
and kept pumping from there...until thomas stopped it at 8.00am. 
As we all know, there really is a party "vibe", or whatever
u may call it (frenzy, phrensy, tingle,delirium,fever, ecstacy,ebullience, etc.)
and,imho, it's more palpable/tangible at Wicked. Furthermore, it becomes more 
apparent the later it gets. The Wicked crowd always stay til the end.. i.e.,
the place is still packed at 8.00AM... and, again imho, it's the energy
that exists after 4AM that makes a great party. It's the stamina/staying power 
of fellow revellers that snowballs into that after 4AM "vibe". 
Again, I'm probably hopelessy trying to express something transcendental with
mere words, but what the phuch :)
As far as the music goes.. I love the Wicked crew's music but I'd much rather 
listen to Simon or DRC's set. However, I'd still go to the former even tho' I 
may prefer the music of the latter two.. (ok ok .. so I'm weird :)

PS: Jus got SIMON's new NARCOTIC from Ameba... it's good.. (understatement intentional :)

_hugz_ and respect for ur opinion :)

(Im glad they still pay me when Im writing to SFRaves :)

No, you said that the *only* day martin could you use was the 17th...I am
suggesting that that kind of precision is unnecessary, and, in fact, the
F&F anniversary will be at least a month late of the *exact* date. But the
3 year gathering *could*, really, have been anytime so the argument that we
should make way for him cos the 17th is the *only* date he can use just
doesn't wash with me...

Once again, no argument here; Martin does a lot of great work in the scene,
I love him for it too... But that still doesn't mean that we should all
just roll over evertime one of his anniversaries (*there's* lots of them,
which might make *your* point ;) rolls around. You've been saying we should
do that for the sake of *community* and I'm saying that, Martin's many
contributions notwithstanding, the community is bigger than that and other
areas of it need and deserve just as much support as martin is entitled to.

Hmmm.... I don't know; Spun can reallly roll some straight up *acid house*
(not acid trance -- acid house); mark farina and others as well; they may
not play it often but...

Perhaps not, but describing things in terms of "once in a lifetime", etc.
certainly puts them in mythic proportion.

Yes, I would most certainly feel uncomfortable, but I also wouldn't call it
a rave nor would I compare it to raves...

What risk is inherent in going to party and spreading some vibe? Jaded
maybe but selfish and lazy? Seems a bit extreme...

I don't think we've lost touch nor do I know any people who I would say
view themselves as too cool for big parties. Some people have found,
contrary to your experience, that they have a harder time finding vibe at
the bigger parties than at smaller parties. For many too, what they want
out of a party has also, simply changed. Your right though that here is
nothing quite like a massive that's *fully* going off. 2000 people rocking
to the same rhythm is indeed awesome to behold :)

Ya gotta stay past 4 a.m. before you can really evaluate any party.
Wicked's tend to be like 7 mile long freight trains, they start off 
slow and take a long time to build up velocity, but they are moving
like a bat outta hell by the time they hit the kansas plains at 4 a.m.

The evening started for me at sound check around 9 p.m., I arrived
to help out with set-up.  The Troc seems to be the ideal indoor setting
for the Purple People Pusher as it sounds the best there of any indoor 
location that I have heard it in. Greg informed me that the had a blown 
crossover on one side so that at least one side would not have completely
seperated sound, hmm. Markie was to open, followed by Garth, Jeno and
Thomas. We were still fooling with the sound at 10:45 when greg as me to 
put some records on so they can balance levels (I had my records with me
at the time, I told him that I'm not very good and would train-wreck, he 
said it didn't matter we just need to get the levels set up. So I opened my
crate and went at it.  It was alot of fun playing on that monster system
and it's really easy to beat match when you FEEL IT in every atom of your
body, (fuck me that's loud ;) Any way I was having fun even though I made 
a few mistakes, around 11:10 greg comes to me and says Markies not here yet
so we're letting people in, I said OH shit! No!!!, he says don't worry, your
doing fine, (I didn't think so), so I got to play for another 20 minutes
until Markie arrived and took over.  I must say that it did get my adrenalin
going and I can see what it must be like to know what your doing and to
be behind the controls of a sound system as massive as that one.

	Markie started off with some intense and wild house, he got people 
moving and grooving, his set had peaks and valleys, I loved parts of it
and was apathetic at other parts but basicaly I enjoyed it, Garth came on
and played one of the crowd pleasing sets he's fameous for, high energy
but not extremely mind expanding, he layed the shot up for Jeno at 4 a.m.
who delivered the goods, this was not the best Jeno set that I have heard but 
it was very good and worthy of the Jeno(tm) stamp.  Can anyone say Acieeed?
Pretty soon I was cross-eyed and in a state of perfect trance, (which is
what it's all about for me), he worked it, through mountain peaks and valley
lows, the energy on the dance floor mounted and by 5 a.m. escape velocity
had been achieved, I looked around to find many people tranced and all swaying
to one rythym.  Thomas came on next and played Jungle! A lot of folks didn't
like it but the stuff he played, I really loved! Nice soulfull Jungle, I can
see how people would love to be on E and dance to this. After about 20 minutes
of this he gave up and switched to the Punk-Funk-House that he is fameous for
7:30 came and the dancefloor was still full and people still going off hard,
I love thomas in the morning, he gives you that extra boost at 7:30 to get
you through the morning! whether your driving home or to the End-Up, Thomas
will keep you dancing to the end Right-On bro.  
	All in all I would say that it was a good party for Wicked, the music
was on track though not balistic and the crowd (an _extremely_ important part
of the alchemy) was friendly, freaky and ready to party.  I think the 
troc is a good location for these monthlies, the security seems to have 
lightened up on their goon tactics and I believe the club did well at the Bar
I hope Wicked gets to do parties there again, I think it can only get better
from here.

     Hey All,
     
     As with all the posts regarding this..I concur.. Wicked was once again 
     AWESOME! Yes, the music wasnt as acid housey as usually put out by 
     Jeno, Markie, and Crew, but I'm sure they too wanna experiment from 
     time to time. Either ways there were many of the fun fun tunes we all 
     love to bounce to..
     
     But other than that it was a sufefire hit! Hello to all you SFRavers I 
     met/met again there... The VIBE was the best! But then thats what sets 
     Wicked apart from the rest, isnt it? The Vibe! God, I met sooo many 
     smiley happy people that night! The Blinky Light was going crazy :)...
     
     And to see ( once again! ) a sea of hardcore ravers dancing away at 
     7:45 am...... WOW! Cant wait for the New Years' Wicked /PureSpace/ 
     Spundae thang!
     
     (: Keep it smilin' folks, and seeya at the Gathering :)

i like to crash parties !!
also, i'm Special :^) 
can't say reality-matching
is a comfort criteria 

Re: good ol days

Call this a pet peeve of mine, but all these parties are
really experiential and in the moment so I just don't buy
into this "scene history" nor do I think it is the "future"
of anything.  It is happening Now.  I don't think that
minimizes anything.  Attempts to extrapolate forward
or backward in time seem pointless to me.  The idea
of a Community coming together is a nice warm fuzzy
sentiment, great, but I don't like the idea of "owing"
something to a party cuz of it's history.  That strikes
me as absurd.  I can't imagine getting all worked up
over missionary vibing at big parties.

If you are into it - Go   
Don't expect me to be your reality
Old school mold school

PS - I can't wait for a massive north carolina pre-july 88
(no butterfly) tag team freestyle jammy jam Party.  I mean, really,
I can't find this shit anywhere in SF ...  I've been lookin
for years !!

PSS - Geoff is one lucky duck

PSSS - more reviews! - especially newbie lurker folks and first time
visits to parties (wicked) - who wants "experienced ravers" blabbing about
the subtleties of black light placement in the chill room, aaahh yes,
i found the bathroom sink to be especially flourescent, was that a
*menthol* air freshener I smelled at the Troc this weekend???

Midnight.

Don't know. But my expeience of Dead shows is that security will start
chasing everyone out of the parking lot as soon as the show ends.
Probably around 11pm. (might be earlier for a Sunday show).

	I don't think the point of considering the hip-hop party was to 
compare it to as rave, but instead to take us out of an element that we 
are now comfortable in and put us in the shoes of a newbie coming to 
their first rave. Small parties do have the effect of shunning new people 
especially when the 'crowd' already knows one another. It is not 
necessarily something one does consciously either. Take an example.
	This past weeked, I finally became old enough to legally attend 
all those age exclusive things that have sat on the horizon (ie. Sat was 
my 21st birthday). After Wicked some friendds crash at my place for abit, 
woke me up and eventually took me to Spundae. The crowd seemed kinda 
tight so I found myself pleasantly surprised (I have heard so many bad 
things about DV8). But as the night went on, I noticed a few things. 
People would break eye contact with me as soon as it was made, yet after 
I was introduced to them (by a friend who seemed to know everyone) I was 
no  longer plagued by the evil eye dodge. This type of thing seems to 
happen more often at smll parties where people know one another (Yes, it 
happens at big parties, but I do not think one feels quite as alienated 
at a big party).

	But if one cannot find/create the vibe at the bigger parties, 
then they have lost touch in one sense. And if what they want from a 
party has changed, then they have moved away from what originally drew 
them to come out in the first place. In my opinion, the former points away 
from creating the energy that makes a 2000+ party go off (and thus makes 
people go "OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, so this is a rave..." which makes them 
come back and dance, smile, hoot and holler...). Hmmm, this sounds kinda 
like I am preaching community service, but that is not my intent. I just 
get kind tired of people wanting a canned party that will be going off 
without putting any energy into the party (that's not meant as a flame to 
anyone on here, more to a few friends who have stopped going out cuz 
"they cannot find a vibe at the parties nowadays"). Then again, maybe it 
is better that people who are not willing to bring their vibe with them 
stay at small parties (or at home) as if there is no vibe, they will just 
sit and pout
	I myself have no preference to the size of the party (except for 
what I am in the mood for at the time). I have been to amazing small 
parties. I have been to brillant big parties. Each has their pluses, but 
being introduced to raves through Martin's first or second Visions, I 
still see big parties as good, not too overwhelming medium to introduce 
people to such wonders.... But as I said, I was weened on big parties.

So wuz up wit' that, huh? I know ya gotta handle being alone, but it's YOUR

choice, I would go to both parties! Also, know that tha we want ya ta come
too......and hey, maybe we'll go to F&F, but ya gotta remember that a party
is what ya make of it. I've been to parties where there weren't many familiar

 Sokay, le'me get this straight! Come New Year's Wicked's gonna be at
Deviate? If I do remember, tha last time I went ta Wicked, it was at
Deviate.....(yet, my memory ain't what it used ta be.)
    Anyways my point is......why Deviate? I mean, come on, don't they expect
ta have a high head count that night? That location can really get cramped,
if ya know what I mean. Most of the people I know had a hard time breathin'
in there and had to jump up front just ta get a wiff of S.F.'s aromatic air.
And once the place is packed.....it's packed! Not a whole room ta move.....
    Don't get me wrong! The parties there were pretty phat and the vibe was
'ella sick. Tha memories were plentiful and so was the unity. 
Although I like tha smaller places where you can't lose yer friends, that
place's setup is kinda odd. :-)
    If anybody has anymore info. 'bout tha party just spew it. Oh yeah, if my
info's wrong just straighten me out. (of course all the people who told me
about tha party may need to get there info. sraight too. :-)

Actualy I beleive this is gonna be the same as last years DV8 Block Party.
They rented out the whole parking lot, which is partly covered with some
big overpass. It made for a very cool industrial like setting. I was only
in the actual club for about 10min all night & there was plent of room
outside. Unfortunatly this is on the same night as Galon's party.

Why is this? Do you not feel you owe (probably not the best word for this,
but it'll work) your support to Wicked for providing you with *good* free
parties. Why do you go to the parties you go to, you usualy don't just go
to any old random party you probably go to parties that have had a good
history with you, or a friend.

Ethan, I wasn't saying you should just roll over, it just upsets me when
someone decides to go *against* the Gathering because of personal
differences & you know I wasn't refering to you.

OK I agree to disagree with you, but I don't want either of us to be
misunderstood by oneanother.

Why would you feel uncomfortable? I would guess that the reason being 
(in it's simpleist form) because you felt like an outsider. If you were
into that scene you wouldn't feel like an outsider. Can you understand
that if one of these guys who usualy went to hip-hop partys (but have
it in them) went to F&F they would probably feel like outsiders. Chances
are if they went to a big party they would feel much more comfortable, now
if all big partys sucked he would have no way of getting it out of
himself, but if he went to one with a *vibe* he might be able to get what
it's all about & with that knowledge he would obviously become one of us :)

No, I too have a harder time finding a vibe at big parties. Now why do you 
think there is less vibe. There are plenty of people who like to go off in
the city. If most of the hardcore don't go ofcourse the vibes gonna suck,
nebies showing newbies what it's about doesn't work to well. If this has
happened I'd say we've definatly lost touch with them. Unfortunatly I
think everybody has fallen in to the trap of thinking there was nothing
they could do about this

> For many too, what they want out of a party has also, simply changed. 

This is what I meant by going for the community & not for your individual

Right on!
One of the things I was most jazzed about moving out here from New Mexico a few
months ago was precisely that there usually is more than one thing going off
every weekend. That's opposed to one thing going off in NM per month. Not that
the scene out there is any less "cool" - I went to some killer, albeit low-budget,
events under the breathtaking desert sky.

We took a friend of a friend who's from St. Louis to Wicked this weekend. (see "1st
wicked") From what she said, the scene in St. Louis sounds very low-attitude,
high-energy and high-enthusiasm. Yet she's probably moving to SF in a few weeks
specifically because of the critical mass of the scene here.

I don't sense that any of the promotors of the upcoming three parties are
engaging in spiteful competition. Likewise, even though I'm definately going to
F&F and probably staying there all night, why on earth would I have a problem
with someone else choosing to go to one of the other two and stay there? I think
some of you are taking this "tribalism" thing a tad too far.

Peace!

PSSS - more reviews! - especially newbie lurker folks and first time
visits to parties (wicked) - who wants "experienced ravers" blabbing about
the subtleties of black light placement in the chill room, aaahh yes,
i found the bathroom sink to be especially flourescent, was that a
*menthol* air freshener I smelled at the Troc this weekend???


Dave
--------------------------------------
Geez, Dave! My eyes started watering trying to contain my laughter in this
normally quiet office space.

Could you be talking about ME?

I've heard lots about Wicked, so I was eager to go and see for myself. 

Earlier in the week, an adamantly-non-raver friend called and said they had a
friend visiting from St. Louis who wanted to go to a certain "big rave." I'd
heard that Wicked tours, so I asked if that was what she was thinking of. Yes,
and she'd be really bummed if she left SF without going. Well, how could Lisa
and I pass up the opportunity to show the town to someone when we've only been
here three months ourselves?

We got to SF at about 12, speeding from an early-evening Christmas party. When
we picked up Rebecca from St. Louis, it turns out she's more plugged into the scene
here than we'd anticipated ("I called Mark Farina before I left, but he's in
Brazil..."). Really nice, though, and gave us some interesting insights on the
mid-west scene.

I was a little disappointed to find that it was at the Troc, since all of the
events we've been to here have either been in warehouses or at the Troc.
However, once we got there, the sound was set up nicely, and the crowd was
filling in what had been empty spaces on previous visits.

Lisa and I hit the floor immediately, but Rebecca wanted to hang out on the
steps for a while. I'm usually more into acid/techno/trance, but whatever
sub-class was being played there, it really hit the spot! Lisa and I danced
harder and longer than any event since hitting SF, and met some people right there
in the middle of the floor. 

At one point, someone started gyrating against me back-to-back hard and slow.
Turning around, I found a short-haired lesbian girl kissing another short-haired
girl. Blissful confusion incarnate!

I started to worry that Rebecca might be getting bored, but when we made our way
back over to the steps, she had a small crowd of people gathered around the
speaker chatting happily. Since a few people had warned that Wicked's about
dancing, not meeting and talking, this was a real nice surprise!

We stayed and danced till 6:30, then crawled out into the dawn to face the drive
home to 408-land.

I'd definitely go again. I'd even spend another $15. Nice to find yet another
near sure thing in the city!

And, oh, Dave, by the way, the bathroom floor had a facinating mixture of sweat
and urine. I briefly contemplated what it'd be like to lose my footing there, but
only briefly...

take care!

Hey everyone--

I'm headed to Houston, TX for a couple of weeks and won't be reading my 
email as frequently, so I'm unsubbing for the interim.  If you need to 
get in touch with me, this is the address to do it at.

Be careful at whichever parties you decide on attending.

I see a difference between going to a party because it has been fun
before or a friend recommends it and the suggestion that I should go
to a party just because it has been around for awhile.  In fact, what
I thought was said in this thread was something along the lines of
"you should set aside your space/music/size/money preferences and go
to X party cuz they have done so damn much for everyone".  Like this
is some kind of motivational rallying call.

I don't let a parties history influence my decision to attend - at 
least not as much as my other preferences.  That's me.  Whether or
not a party is "established" is the absolute bottom of things I might
consider before goin out.  In otherwords, I don't care whether Joe
Promoter was affiliated with Toon Town 3 years ago.  I guess I don't
care much more than the last party they threw ... (not completely but
you get my point)

When I got started, I went to big parties because, well, they were
visible. And with all that crap on the flyer, I'd surely get something
for my $20. And some of the parties were pretty insane, and sometimes
I even got $20 worth.

But it never felt friendly until I went to my first Your Sister's
House, at the recommendation of someone on sfraves. I didn't know
anyone there at all, but when I left I knew 6 people by name, and I
usually don't remember names.

It's difficult to generalize. I've been to big parties that were
friendly (Full Moon in Richmond '93, most C/U and Basics), big parties
that were unfriendly, and all shades in-between. If I go to them, I
try and pick ones I think will be fun in a fun space. Once in a while
I'm terribly wrong, and I kick myself for a month for missing a really
good one that gets rave :) reviews. I've also been to smaller parties
that seemed to be staring contests. You just gotta go and figure out
which specific party turns you on.

There are tried and true parties I *know* are going to suit my vibe,
and they are usually smaller ones. Some of these have been done so
well that I really believe in them and pitch in to help. The smaller
parties usually need all the help they can get :).

I do agree with Ethan on one thing: There's no good reason for any
party to defer to another, as if the other were more righteous. And I
felt this way long before I ever met him.  All parties big or small
have people who need them, and bowing out to another party is to let
those people down. Some people will *only* go to small parties... will
we make them stay home?

One nice thing about F&F is it's only $3, parking is easy, and it gets
a great vibe going early (last time we had a great vibe before the
music even started..). So people can go to both parties! I think it'll
be an awesome night.

I see your point here.  I think any party you go to, no matter how much 
it costs, or where it is, can be great or crappy depending upon what 
happens.  Some of the factors that can be involved in making a crappy 
party are:

---A bad goon scene
---Lack of Water
---A very high ticket price 
---It gets busted
---Poor sound quality
---------------------it gets really bad when all of the above combine to 
make for a really crappy party.  Sometimes these are the promoter's 
fault.  Sometimes they are not, in varying increments.

I dont think that small parties shun people at all.  In fact I think that 
smaller parties usually have a much more positive vibe than larger ones.  
Yeah most people already know each other but that izz a good thing.  I 
find that it's much easier for me to meet others and be open when I'm 
already placed in a comfortable environment where I feel at ease.  If I'm 
at a party where I already know lotsa people and feel at ease I'm more 
likely to try to meet even more, but if I'm at a huge gathering where 
*everyone* iz a stranger that would kinda keep me quiet.  
	When I went to ff4 I came with 3 of my friends and knew 
absolutely *no one else*.  Not a single person.  But because of the 
strong FF vibe, by the end of the night I had met an incredible amount of 
people.......

Mijos, enuf ego-stroking! Go where you feel good in advance, and make damn
sure you enjoy wherever you and whatever you do, to the fullest. An then
share it all with anyone you didn't meet the night before.

Speaking of stroking, um, in solidarity with Joycelyn Elders (ex-sugeon
gen), perhaps we should all give a memorable wank/piano playing in honor of
our best friends, mr(ms?)'s Lefty and Righty, for years of unselfish
enjoyment and safety. I guess the prez is gonna have to do a press
conference with another denial, "I stroked, but did not ejaculate..." it
really scares me that the shift to the right gets so far out that now THEY
want to interfere with what we really do in private.Sheesh(sfr jargon for
exasperation)! I can see it now, getting pulled over, and the cop searches
me for a hard-on.
 Pad-pad-pad-wump!"hmm, a concealed woody! You will have your liscense
revoked for possesion of an erection after 2 am in trafic, sir." 

"Did  you have a liscense for that wet vagina, mrs? And can you tell the
court why you clitoris was entumesced on the night of the 17th? was it drug
induced?"

Ohhh, I can see being part of the new resistance is gonna be hard! Going
underground will involve so much Clearasil and Nair Special Hand Lotion,
but maybe the contact lenses will let me walk out in public.....

Oh, heck, enjoy your parties and all solitary (or group) sexual
manifestations this weekend, and bring all your friends/newbies with you
this weekend, whichever party you go to. Let's trade friends "hmm, one
Scott for two daves(there's so many of them), Cynthia for Cathy, I'll keep
my Brett but hey, I got two Matts for your Brad..."

Lotsa love (and butterflies in my stomach-ooh!I can't wait)

I didn't at all mean you should go to a party *just* because it has been
around for a while. The part of being, for the most part, a consistently
*good* party for a long time is what I was suggesting. It is one of the
only parties left that can create a good place for the whole community to
get together everyonce in a while (something that I think is neccesary for a
healthy one).

We are talking about *newbies* going to small parties. Of course people
already into it aren't going to feel shunned. Yeah, it all depends on your
personality, I'm sure some people would get into it more for the first time
at a small party, but I'd be willing to bet that the majority of people
would feel uncomfortable.

did anyone involved in this quickly-getting-old thread ever go 
to a mr.floppy's
party??

floppy's ran against toontown and other big parties almost 
every time it went
off. in its time, it was the equivalent of a good *wicked* 
EVERY time
it went off.  it did not compete, because it did not compare.  
it thrived because a scant few important details never got 
overlooked:
1)venue..the floppy house(jack london club) was beyond compare! 
 2)price..7.00-10.00
3)dj variety-sometimes 8-10 per party-2decks,4decks, 
upstairs,downstairs...
   boggled the mind
4)art..performances,scheduled and improvisional,always a 
sensory treat
5)PSYCHIC-TV !
FNF stands poised on the threshold of becoming a worthy 
successor
to that tradition...a cocoon, of sorts, where the scene 
retreats to undergo 
a self-evaluation/metamorphosis process...crucible ?  ALLthese 
parties this weekend will go OFF ! they don't even bump heads
if you ask me(did you?) EACH is in SUPPORT of the OTHER, get 
it?
(BIG picture, hello?) the energy that will be released and 
shared will give us all
strength...

my advice-save your nickels-try to taste at least 2 of these 
parties on 17 dec
you will expand your understanding of the *vibe* that is at the 
core of this
thing we call raving...you'll also spread more of it..

peace-n-positivity

	Right, so my first legal Wicked came as a birthday present this 
last weekend. Got a ride into SF cuz I got my bag knicked at Down to 
Earth (so I do not have keys to our communal car anymore, nor a driver's 
lisence to show the nice officer) and walked over to the Troc from Market 
(Had forgotten their is a B of A on the corner of Byrant and 5th). Paid, 
and got my hand stamped. And out on to the floor went I...
	Bumped around for a bit and ran into Jovie who decided my whistle 
needed to be in my mouth, but the music at the time did not demand the 
piercing tone of the piece of flourescent orange plastic. Danced, hooted, 
hollered for a bit, but then felt that things were being stagnent. Hmmm, 
Garth was spinning, nice but kinda flat. So up I headed to the chill room 
to find the person I had come with. The chill room was nice, met a 
couple groups of friendly people, one of whom had the most amazing 
feeling hands, I forgot her name though. Taught my little hand thingy to 
a few more people and decided I had become bored...
	So I went back down to dance and that is where I remained until 
somewhere around 7:30 when I stopped to get a drink and was confronted 
with a screaming rapture bearing a relatively lengthy sword (ok, it was 
actually a friend I hadn't seen since the summer and the rapture was made 
of plastic, the sword a meer paper clip. But it does actually scream...)
	The biggest thing I noticed about Wicked (and about Spundae the 
next night) was that people were a hell of a lot ore comfortable with 
themselves then at 18+ parties (I do not mean to reopen this can of 
worms, just an observation). By this I mea those times when eye contact 
is made and then the other person looks way REALLY quickly and every once 
in a while you catch a worried face glancing to see if you are still 
looking in that direction... Which is good cuz I think that when people 
actually make eye contact (and can deal with it, why is eye contact so 
hard to deal with?) the parties tend to be better (hmmm, do I get flamed 
by the lot of the trance lovers?). Right. So Wicked was a good time, both 
for the dance and the talk...

Agreed.  If I'm in an unfamiliar location, it's far easier to start a
conversation with to someone sitting in the corner (hence a newbie like myself)
rather than try to break into a large circle of people talking about things
going on amongst their own society of friends.

Small parties tend to be composed of a circle of people that already know each
other.

Actually mailing anything at north.pole.org will just get your mail
bounced.  Sun has given all the money it allocated for the charity
thing and there are now thousands of pieces of mail being sent to 
the site, all of which will most likely be bounced or ignored.

Check out their web site, I think it says more about it.

Found a great web site:

http://www.kaiwan.com/~garyrich/play-midi.html

plays a random midi file through Netscape or Mosaic and your sound card.
Since midi files are small, downloads are fast.  Yeah I know most midi files
are cheesy but it's fun and not too bad if you have a good sound card.  You
have to set up your web browser for midi(instructions are at the site).

Ouuch, sounds like a hard choice. I went to last years block party & had a
great time, so I'll probably go again. Plus this year we'll get the new
sound system crankin' with no holds barred all nightfor the first time
outside. The spot & production were extremely cool, outdoors, very good visuals,
industrial feeling. All the DJ's pretty much kept more of a harderhouse
/acid/trance feeling through the night (nobody can tear your head apart
quite like these guys, when they try), which matched the spot very well.
This  is one of the reasons that I think they are the top dj's in the city,
they are *very* good at using their music with the location to create a
solid mood.

Hi all,

I am new in this list and this is my first posting. I am a
Dj, Party organizer and Journalist (house music and local
events) in Frankfurt, Germany.
This message is intended for all people who are in any way involved
with a record label or company or who can forward this message
to someone involved. Naturally we have allready quite some 
material but we need now personal contact with the makers and
owners.

Thanks for your help - if someone wants to visit Frankfurt you
know who to ask!

Jens

'Techno/Style' book project
 
We are planning the publication of a book on the subject of 
'Techno/House Design'. We are particularly interested in the 
design of record sleeves, flyers and merchandising (T-shirts, 
baseball caps etc.). We are aware that it will be impossible 
to provide a complete overview, however, we will reflect all 
developments and trends. We intend to include a wide range of 
international work as well as the more well known examples 
of the genre.
 
During our research your label came to our attention. We would 
be most grateful if you could provide us with some information 
about your company and, if possible, examples of your work for 
inclusion in our project.
 
We expect the book to be published in early summer 1995 by a 
respected publishing company specialising in design and in 
particular, books about record sleeves. The publishers are keen 
to ensure that the project will be handled professionally - in 
particular with regards to copyright.
 
About ourselves:
During the last three years both Markus Weisbeck and Martin Pesch 
worked as designer and editor respectively for the cultural 
magazine 'Heaven Sent'.
In 1994 we exibited a selection of influential record sleeves 
throughout the history of pop, together with a sleeve they inspired, 
under the title 'The Retrographic Beat'. The exibition was shown 
in both Frankfurt and Hamburg.
 
 
 
We look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Yours faithfully
M. Weisbeck/M. Pesch/J.Prewo

  ...In the words of Butthead :)

  The next month is going to be so friggin awesome!  Not only do I have a 
1 month vacation but I have what are potentialy some of the best parties 
of the year each weekend!  If the vibe keeps growing at this rate, 95' is 
going to be amazing! I would just like to make a little list of party 
suggestions for the holidays.  Yes it is a bit biased towards parties the 
parties I know I'll be going to, but... oh well ;)

Dec 17th:

1. Friends and Family - It's going to be crazy!  If PGE could find a way 
to harness the energy at F&F, our power needs would be filled for 
months!  I think the music this time will be the best yet because of the 
wide variety of DJ's in both rooms.  (Hard)Acid, (Hard)Trance, 
(Hard)House (and maybe some stuff too) and (Insane)Ambient.  The price 
can't be beat either.

2. The Gathering - If F&F wasn't happening, there would be now way I 
would miss this.  I enjoy Martin's parties much more then the FTT/Cool 
World's, and always love having tons of lasers and videos and... well... 
Just one MASSIVE environment (sound, lights, people, DJ's etc.)  The 
price is a probably going to be a bit high though, and if you want to get 
high, we're talking about an expensive night out.  If you haven't 
experienced a BIG party in a while, and feel the need... Then do it!

3. Stompy Family and Friends - The DJ's are very nice and the Troc is one 
of my favorite club locations (except the gestapo security) I have a 
feeling the crowd here will be very mixed and if the DJ's do their job, 
it has the potential for being a great night. There are always parties 
each week I don't feel bad for missing, but this is one I would go to if 
it was the only party... OR if it was on Friday! :)

  So, as you can see (at least from my point of view) it doesn't really 
matter what you choose this weekend, it's going to be AWESOME!  A lot of 
people are done with school or are just starting their vacations and will 
have lots of energy to spare. 

Dec 23rd - It's Christmas time.. I don't think I'll be going out, but I 
did see some promising flyers around, and if the energy from this weekend 
carries over It'll be another great weekend... Although it is possible a 
lot of people might take a break to save up for New Years.

New Years! -PARTY SMART!- Don't Fry, Boom, Smoke, Get High, Tweek or Drink 
            and Drive... DMT would probably be a bad thing too :p 

1. Cloud Factory New Year's in Monterey - OK, here is where I am biased :)
if you live in San Jose or Santa Cruz or within a 1-1.5 hour drive of 
Monterey I would LOVE to see you at our party!  We've been putting tons 
of energy into our parties since this summer and have been planning this 
one for a while.  If you want to experience a young, fresh and energetic 
vibe then come check it out.  Plus, when the sun rises you will be in one 
of the most beautiful places in the world, not under some highway :)

2. Wicked Block Party - Not much I can say here.  Will definetly be a 
rockin party just because most of the people who bring Wicked the vibe 
and energy it has will be there, and a lot of 'tourists' will probably 
decide to go to Cool World/FTT.

3. Cool World/FTT - Ack.. When I read "20,000 person capacity" on the 
back of the flyer I got scared. For two reasons: A: With that many 
people, security becomes a problem (take a look at most BIG concerts) and 
seeing anything from a fight to someone just freaking out can be a BIG 
buzz kill. B: For some reason I have a vision that when they do the 
10.9.8.7 countdown 1/3 of the people will be tripping and what know 
what's going on, another 1/3 will be too tough to shout and the other 1/3 
might start cheering but will stop because no one else is... Oh well, I 
could be wrong, but I don't think H-U-G-E parties go over as well in the 
states as they do in Europe (I went to some in London that were 'fucking 
BRILLIANT!')

3. Galen's Party - Sorry, I'm blanking on the name right now :( .. But I 
do know that the Pacific parties (and all the underground posses) always 
have a great vibe at thier parties, and as one of my friends was telling 
me, "It's not the music, it's the vibe.."

Questions you should ask yourself before deciding on a party (or two):

1. Am I going for the vibe? (ie: Wicked often has a very sexual vibe 
while the Pacific parties are very friendly and F&F insane high energy.)

2. Can I afford it? or Do I get what I pay for?

3. Will my friends be there? (Those of us that party a lot usualy know 
which party are other 'rave' friends will go to.  It's always nice to be 
amongst people you know and love and have a great time with!

And that's that... (shameless self promotion coming up ;) I hope all of 
you who plan to go to multiple parties on Saturday will stay at F&F at 
least till 4 (It would be nice if you could stay all night, but trying 
out other parties is healthy) because I've been waiting to spin at F&F 
for almost 6 months and I finally am!
I am also FULLY 1000% PSYCHED to: Wear holes in your 
socks, send you into rave convulsions (aka insane dancing), communicate 
with aliens and take the combined energy of everyone at the party and 
channel it into the mixer! :)

 See you all on Saturday!!!

Peace out and much love and energy!

-Ernie 'DJ Deaks'

Cloud 9 is an "herbal" alternative to E.

It's main effect is to make you poorer.

I went to floppies foer most of my first parties, I went by toon town and 
it looked like a bunch of drunk yuppies, Floppies did to of course, but I 
felt comfortable there. I must say it was freakish and arty and no one 
ever talked to me but it was fun and wierd. I thought the sound and music 
sucked most of the time but it always had a feeling of being out of control.
It seemed like a large scale spaz with a very diverse crowd.

onse i walked into a room that was all green and a green naked woman on 
green stick furniture and actuall roll turf making it cool and quiet, sod 
absorbed sound. The next room had slabs of meat everywhere. It was acid 
party not eccy.

salutations, allen@ameba

The basic deal was they would donate $.10 for every time you visited 
their Web site, not send email to those addresses...

There's even a rumor starting to circulate that is was a big hoax, 
getting people to send mail to santa and having money being donated...but 
that wasn't the deal at all.

> anyone heard of a drug called cloud 9?

I had what was promoted as the manufacturer's address (I think in 
Sonoma), wrote to them for specs and info but got zero response. I've 
heard two conflicting bits about it: 1) that it's the same as 2CB, 
and 2) that it's an herbal concoction containing ephedra aka Ma 
Huang.

I also heard that the address I got was some sort of FBI sham to 
compile a list of people to keep an eye on... I really think that's a 
little paranoid & the FBI has much "better" things to be screwing 
around with than watching people like me!

Subject: My theory on "Cloud 9"
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


First, let me state that the law is pretty clear on selling
either drugs or foods.
If "Cloud 9" is a drug, and is promoted as being psychoactive
and similar to say, MDMA, (an illegal drug) then posession
of any amount of said substance that was promoted as being "similar" to
MDMA would be prosecuted essentially in the same way.
And the weight of the substance would be used to calculate
the penalty in the same way that would be done for the substance that
"Cloud 9" was represented as being similar to..
In other words, possesion of say, one gram of "Cloud 9" would
be considered to be as serious an offense as possesion of one gram of MDMA.

On the other hand, if "Cloud 9" is a food, there is aclear case
of copyright infringement going on.
"Cloud Nine" is a registered trademark of the Cloud Nine candy bar
company, and I doubt if they would take kindly to copyright infringement.

There is also the issue of honesty in packaging.
A food (or drug) manufacturer is required by law to list the ingredients
in their product. There are lots of reasons for this, none the least
of which is the identification of what would be the cause of any adverse
reaction it would cause.. From what I can see..the Cloud Nine
people have not been forthright about their ingredients.

This is wrong.

And if they were anything other than a front for something far more sinister
they would have been busted long ago..

I think that C9 is some kind of a sting operation, or perhaps
a project set up by the FDA or the DEA to make medicinal use of herbs
illegal, something the FDA and the AMA have been trying to do for a long time..

If you want to patronize them, it's your choice..

     From what I have heard about Cloud 9, it sounds like it could be 
     Yohimbine, I'm not sure since I haven't tried it.  Is there anyone out 
     there who have tried both?  Yohimbine extracted from the bark of the 
     Yohibi tree, and is available at a lot of health food stores.

2 is correct. Cloud 9, (herbal) Extacy, and stuff like that
is just a thing packed full of Herbs that will give
you one hell of a rush which is similar to other
methamphatine products

1 comes from the product Nexus which was a very light
dosage of 2CB that would cause the tactile sensation,
mild euphoria and probably some pretty colours too :)

When Nexus was being marketed big time at raves, 
that is when 2CB got moved to Schedule 1 classification

Abominations!
>I was wondering, has anyone heard of a drug called cloud 9? Can someone 
>tell me what its effects are?

 Yeah, I've heard/read it's ma huang extract and some other stuff too, all
herbal and concentrated and safe, but it's expensive and all it is is
ephedrine and *maybe* norpseudoephedrine, the latter from khat, but they
are sorta lousy about telling you what's in it.
 These just get you wired, but in a different way than simple caffeine, and
there is a RAVE LEGEND that you must be sober for 6 months before you pop
one. That works 'cause you forget what it's like to be high so that this
lack of intimacy gets you a good ride on that little puny rush. It's good,
it'll get you all night long, but X IT AIN'T, HoNEYBUNS! 

It is a bronchodilator and gets yer pulse pulsing, but you can but pure
ephedrine dirt cheap at the pharmacy (broncaid pills, 4-6 are good; the
inhalant is awesome for an immediate rush when your already hi, and you can
get gell caps made at the pharmacy and snort 'em, all legal) or go to an
herbal store and buy ma-huang extract, mormon tea, or khat if yer lucky.
This is what I've gathered and read so far, so I am open to all
corrections/doubts. It gets longer still, but this has been my guinea pig
project over the summer....

For an undeniable herbal whack in the psyche, try yohimbe. It is very
effective, gets you wired, and has one side-effect:ERECTIONS AND A STRANGE
DESIRE TO FU*K anything that moves. It is used to treat impotence and is
sold by cloud 9 as a party supplement, I've used it a a chemistry party and
two sunsets, the energy i got was wonderful, but the loose pants and no
underwear made me a bit worried about all that jumping and bumping.
 NEVER MIX YOHIMBE WITH OTHER DRUGS, except maybe weed, since it is a MAO
inhibitor (mono amine oxidase) a normal detox apthway in yer body, and if
you have taken an amphetamine (diet pills, x, speed, get it mijos?) you can
have severe reactions, maybe get taken by the whitecoats into that noisy
wagon.Also avoid if you are hypoglycemic(how iz that spelled?).
Ah, you'll puke if you don't take vitamin C, 250 mg 1/2 hour before, and
250  or more with it. Makes it stronger, faster, and more fun. Colors seem
brighter and richer (like on x/lucy) and you become subtly more open to
vibes and people, and really works well at vibey things like Pacific
parties. You start with spinal shivers (like being cold and getting a
hickey) and you get energy and erections, or horny if yer equiped with
matching software :) it really feels good to touch, BUT E IT AIN'T again,
but my favorite legal botanical.

You can also buy it at herbal stores, get the nasty liquid extract (alcahol
or glycerol extratct) and have 3 spoons of it, it costs $12 for a bottle
that lasts 3 parties or more.remeber, it's serious, don't fuck with
amphetamines, and even eating meat/hi-protein meals is not a good idea, so
lay off the taco bell. Take some gatoraide in case yer blood sugar drops,
especially if you like dank.

Happy exploring,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

Oh, phblat! It is NOT some front for the dea to make hebals illegal, these
have been pushed in so many "drug" books like Legal Highs  that they would
have enuf reason already, and they have proven medecinal value so there
would be huge legal problems as well, plus they have so little bang, why
even try to make them illegal?

If you want hebal alternatives to E, go to the pharmacy/herbal store and
buy those pep, happy campers, ginsing, ma huang, etc. extracts, and pop 3-5
at a time. You will get a rush, and a slurpee will add to the effect. Sorry
boys, as Dorothy sez "there's no drug like E, there's no drug like E"

If you are worried about safety, remeber that most of the studies done on
"drugs" were conducted by research "fronts" set up by the us military and
the CIA during the 50's and 60's, with names like the "J.K.Hopmeyer
institute for pharmacalogical research" you get the idea...and they tried
to get the cooperation of naive scientists working at univiersities, in the
hopes of getting a "truth serum" and once they found that all these drugs
were deconditioning agents (ie, "why I am a soldier? Why do I follow stupid
orders? Maybe I should leave this place"...) they dropped the research and
were exposed (G. Wasson had a run in with these bastards, as did A.
Shulgin) but some of these "firms" published data about chromossomal and
brain  damage from lsd and how pot causes cancer and makes you go to lynard
skynard shows, once popular use grew and they HAD TO STOP it somehow, so
how about scare tactics? And pHDs without a clue and a set of golf clubs
just went along and reproduced these results in legit colleges and
institutes (beleive me, I'm a pHD and all we do is reinvent the wheel!) but
with even less scientific validity, but were accepted as the the then
current dogma in the sci community. 

Mayans have used shrooms for centuries, no damage there (side
effects:spaniards with guns) as have people around the world with amanita
mushrooms (side effect: one hella trip) and most of us have at some time
been afraid to try pot and heard that it makes you stoopid an u canno
funxion (cough!cough!)

Think at the brink, 
 it may surprise you that so many are wrong.....


ps. Drugs of any sort and a steering wheel are still a bad idea. No drug is evil

Here dey iz:

I got 37 replies, all said "yes" to a fmr by someone else if wicked was wacked.

To question B, would you go to another party if they announced all the info
before wicked: "Hell yes" by all but 6 people, who said they:
   didn't want to divide the scene
   wicked fmr was awesome, so they prefer it over anyone else

Well now! that could just mean that the only ones with enuf unf! to answer
are also the only ones pissed at no fmr's this fall/winter, or MAYBE IT IS
TIME FOR CDC, PACIFIC, KINETIC (SPIRALJIVE), CLOUD FACTORY,SPAZ, maybe
MARTIN? to get together and see how to give wicked a crutch or just put the
old man out to pasture.

But if these answers are representative, then an alternative fmr has all it
needs to work. Get the djs, we got the vibe!

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.............

(Ahhh! I fell in love with one of FTT's little ones, and now I find out
they are bed fellows with Cool World! Heart broken! Saddened I say! How

 Nah, if it tickles yer fancy, try it once if you go to a large party (they
sell at big martin parties, every ftt and are a presence at cool worlds)
but don't take them then, try them on a vibey smaller party or at home,
hell, you must have lost money on bunk E before, try and see, individual
ractions vary. Unless you are looking for undeniable euphoria, of course,
but that takes us back to dorothy (I LOVE not being in Kansas anymore!)

Regarding these comments:

>Brian, I agree that "sumptin' missin tho'... dont know what it was..."  But
>I think it was lack of good Music....
>What I'm saying is the music sucked after that.  I enjoy good house music
>but this was lame.  Very low music energy.  
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yeah, the low energy/low bpm music was the big, however only,
disappointment of my evening. I thought that the last Wicked I attended 5
mos. ago at Townsend totally went off in every way -- even though I'm not
the biggest fan of the DJ's
and their music. In comparison, I thought last Saturday's event, though
having a great vibe, had mostly sucko music on the main floor when I was
there between 1:00 and 4:30. The quality lacked and the bpm was just way
too slow for me. 

I had go to the upper floor/ambient area a couple of times to escape some
really unbearable stuff, the second time after whoever played a Blondie
tune. I know every word to that song, but if I want to hear that I'll go
hear Steve Masters spin it in the Red Room at the Sound Factory.

Upstairs was where I really enjoyed the music!! Though the ecstatic crowd
nd soft seating were missing, I had a much better time dancing to the music
in the upper room than on the main floor.

Of course it was great seeing Amit, Giamma, and the other SF Ravers! And,
I'm really looking forward to the musical excellence and higher bpm's at
F&F!!

Regards,
Rob

Here you go!  It's an early Xmas, and Santa has brought you Friends
and Family, the Gathering, and the Stompy Stomp all on one night.
Friends and Family, of course, is the SFR collective party and has
scored four knockouts already and promises to be great once again;
the Gathering is one of the granddaddies of the SF Rave scene; I met
some of you for the first time at the "final" Gathering when SFR was
in its infancy.  Preston's Stompy Stomp has a good lineup too, 
sooo...have as much fun as you can afford!!!

here's my opnion on what's going to be the PHATTEST newyear's party:  

begin again!  by pacific, plus some others, too..  i can't wait!

there's no way i'm heading to anything by wicked newyears, mostly because
LAST year they had a party next to the DV8 and made everybody wait in line
for HOURS.  plus, it was outside under a highway.  for $20, that was lame.

newmooner mona is going to be back in town the day after christmas, by the
way.  we are thinking of doing SOMETHING to commemorate this happy event.
i'll keep you posted!

love,

ann

Well, looking forward to the Gathering this weekend.  Should be
a blast.  If you don't have anything to do on Friday night, come to
Cloud 9/Pure Lov and Sol.  It's been great lately, and we've packed
the house.  Great music, and an after party that lasts all night.
It's at Flanker's in Oakland, for all you East Bay people with
nothing to do on a Friday.  880 to Hegenberger exit.  Over the
overpass toward the water, and it's the second street on the right
(Hegenberger Court).  Ask for me at the door.  Only $5.  See you all
there....

That was Rapture by Debbie Harry.  I never liked that song.  A) She can't rap.
B) She can't sing like a disco diva.  Failure on both counts.  As cheesy
80's nostalgia goes, it may work.  But it wasn't New Wave City nite at the
Troc.  Yuk.  The music started to pick up when I left around 5.  From what I
hear I should have stuck around, but I arrived early in hopes of hearing
great music all night, and was disappointed.

Yeah, you were probably listening to DJ darkhorse of the Gardening Club.
He's great, always spins the unexpected - anything from jungle to the blues.
I always try to catch him if he's doing a chill room, but he also does
Gardening Club on Mondays at Carribean Zone.

See everyone wherever Sat.

Let's do a little SFRaves meeting thing at the Gathering, since I
will be running around taking pictures, etc.  If they set up the
Richmond Civic center like they usually do, in the front of the arena
will be a stage with the DJ booth.  Anyone who is there at 2:00am on
the dot, meet up there, and I'll see if I can get a cool group shot
or something.  Sounds like a good idea, we'll see if it works.  See
you all there...

Wherever Janie & I end up on Saturday, we know that we're gonna have a 
lot of friends going off at both of the other two parties.  But one cool
thing about Luv Phasers is that they have an infinite range - so let's
all try to remember to send some of that vibe energy to our friends 
elswhere.... and listen for it coming in kind.     

One thing seems certain:  This weekend, The San Francisco Bay Area House 
Community is going to *EXPLODE*!!!

Hmm.  Being "pissed" that someone isn't hauling out a sound system in the 
freezing cold to give you a free party seems a bit ingracious to me.  I
cannot speak for the Wicked folks, but remember that they are practicing
Wiccans, to which the Full Moon is a spiritual time.  I would guess that
they would be supportive of anyone's effort to honor it.

Does anyone know anything about the Megatripolis party on New Years Eve?
A friend and I will be in town and we want to know where the best
rave/party will be. I've read about the wicked thing but that sounds
kind of weak. Any other input about Megatripolis or anything cool
would be greatly Appreciated.
        Thanks in advance-
        Amy

        P.S. Be nice, I'm new..

Well I for one will try to make it to ALL three parties, 
it's time to go for the gold!

Who else wants to be a medal contender this weekend? :)

----------------------------------------------------------

"Captain, it's the strangest thing! The Borg suddenly are ceasing
all hostilities!"

"Lieutenant Warf, Your analysis please."

"Captain I believe it is a subtle trick on their part"

"No Warf, I sense some strange emminations coming from that small
class M planet in the adjacent system, Data wasn't that planet
settled by a combined betazoid/humanoid contingent about a century ago?"

"Yes councelor you are correct, the "HouseNation Posse" as they, at one
time refered to themselves by, were a renegade group of anarchistic individuals
who were completely devoted to a "unique form of music" which surfaced
on earth in the late 20th early 21 century.  They assign great value to this
music, almost religeous significance. And are completely dedicated to living
in and spreading what they refer to as "The Vibe""

"Vibe? What is this Vibe?"

"Allow me to explain,  During the late 20th century on Earth, a type of 
"millenial feaver" began to surface as the calender approached the year 2001.
A strange phenomena of all night dance parties, often fueled by psychoactive
drugs swept across the industrialized countries of the time."

"Yes! I remember now!  These ecstasy cults spawned some of the most innovative
artist and scientist that Earth ever knew!"

"That is correct councelor, about a century ago a group of young people
from your planet teamed up with another large group from Earth,  together they
formed the HouseNation, they inhabited this small planet, and since then
have been joined by people from many different races and cultures.
There major export is Music, Art and amazing Cybernetic Technology, to
our best knowledge, they have absolutely no forms of sophisticated
weaponey"

"Yet the Borg seem immobilized, what could cause that"

"Yes... I'm getting it now, wait Geordie, can you patch the bridge into
these hailing frequencies..."

"What the devil is that!"

"That Captain, is House Music, in fact I believe it is the part of the
subgendre labled "Acid House".

"But how can simply beaming a strange form of music immobilize the Borg?"

"You see, Warf it's not just the music, it's this energy that they refer to
as the Vibe, when the betazoids and earthlings interbread, they created a
new race that had exceptional psychic powers, not only were they telepathic
but they figured out how to amplify telepathic thought and even emotions
and transmit them over long interstellar distances" 

"You mean mind control!, Turn this music off at once!"

"Wait Warf, not exactly, you see the HouseNation has a doctrine of non
violence, their demigods are historic individuals like Earth's
Ghandi and Martin Luther King, and Beta's Zenna, they don't seek to
control other cultures, but they do believe in the concept of Aggape or
unconditional love, apparently they are hitting the Borg with their 
"secret weapon" a Luv Phaser.

"Luv Phaser?"

"Yes, they have managed to build a device that can amplify and send
emotions out that are so powerful that they have a direct effect on
the life forms that the beams come in contact with."

"But, but the Borg are a cruel heartless race totally incapable of such
emotions!"

"Well Mr. Warf judging from the effect that this Luv Phaser is having
on that Borg ship, it seems that you are mistaken"



I'll see you all on the dancefloor this weekend!!

Hi Sfravers,

Just in time for X-mas!!! Happy Holidaze!!!!!!

Below, you will find directions for buying DJ Tapes by MAIL/On-Line and a
current DJ TAPE INVENTORY LIST from AMEBA.

This is an advertisement, but......

(Me, Robert Johnson, honorary Sfraver, and Christmas Good-Guy, dreamed up
this Holiday Project, and am offering it to all Sfravers in the spirit of
Christmas, and for the benefit of the FRIENDS & FAMILY community-Sfravers,
Ameba, and the Dj's)---End of Disclaimer....
*************************************************

Last week, someone posted a story about making a fast and furious effort to
purchase the new  DORAN tape, only to find AMEBA closed!!!!!!  Like many
people, whether you live in San
Francisco, or are one of the long distance Motorheads (I live in Monterey)
it's not always easy to get to AMEBA to buy Dj tapes. 

After Geoff White's post about shopping at AMEBA for all your
Sfraves Friends & Family this Christmas, I asked if I could purchase Dj tapes
by mail. Their joyful and effusive holiday response was YES!!!! And YOU can
buy tapes this way too!!!!!!!

      So,  Here's the deal..........(Directions)

1.  Contact Ameba@netcom.com for current inventory of Dj     
     Tapes (See attached for AMEBA DJ TAPE INVENTORY 
      LIST)

2.  TAPES are $16.28 each-- (this includes tax)

3.  CHECKS or MONEY ORDERS

4.  (You will Need 2 kinds of Mailing Envelopes)

       Mailing Envelopes AND Pre-Paid Postage Return Mailers

     A.  Costco, or Office Depot etc. have an assortment of
           plain manila envelopes AND the crush resistant air-
           bubble mailers which are great as the RETURN mailer. 
           

5.  After you have purchased MAILERS, selected the TAPES you 
     wish to buy, AND included CHECK or MONEY ORDER, ADDRESS :

              A.  (Outside Manila Envelope) To:

                              AMEBA
                              1732 Haight St.
                              San Francisco, Ca.   94117

               B.  (Inside)--Self Addressed-Prepaid mailer
                                    (Crush Resistant Bubble envelope)

                                    1. Take the number of BLANK TAPES
                                        you are buying with you to the
                                        post office--Have the Postal Clerk 
                                        weigh the  mailer (w/tapes) and put 
                                        postage on RETURN mailer. ( Example:
  
                                        To Monterey, it is 75 cents Return 
                                        Postage for each tape from SF)
                                        
                                        

And that's it!!!! I hope this starts a virtual feeding frenzy of holiday
madness as Sfravers froth and foam at the mouth to 
purchase their favorite Dj tapes. Happy Holidays!! Maybe we could start a
thread today about which of the following DJ TAPES are your favorite and
why?--PersonalIy, I decorated my Christmas Tree to John Howard, "Below Low"
last night......

+A.T.O.I., Vol. 1 :  Ambient Temple of the Imagination  is into heavy

I hope that what comes of this is not just a money making bomb.
I would like it if people took this list and added tapes and reviews
so that we may have the kind of reference that is bigger than the efforts 
of one. our inventory is but a small turd compared to the massive amount 
of tapes out there.  I hope that a more global list will emerge , one so 
large that sue happy record company lawyers will think twice about trying 
to defend an out moded form of money making -intellectual property.
I think the ability to create is more valuable than a creation.
So If anyone has an "original thought" on the matter, I am trying to put 
together an article on intellectual property for xlr8r, and would love 
"facts" and "quotables"

I would like to mention that tape sales will never pay our rent but it 
does pay for many of the records you hear when you go out.

If anyone thinks this was a vile act of bad net-tiquette please flame me 
publicly or privately as your taste dictates.
salutations, allen@ameba

Greetings Friends!

Well the hullaballoo seems to be behind us and from what I can tell I think
we'll all be bumping (and grinding hopefully ;) into each other sometime
tomorrow night. Should be one of hell of a night! I look forward to seeing
you all then -- somewhere :)

Before heading off into the great beyond I did however want to share some
great news with you:

The long awaited Komotion ventilation upgrade has been accomplished! Word
is that that there is now a hole in the wall with a fan capable of turning
over 40,000 cubic feet of air a minute! I don't know about you but I'm
actually gonna miss the famed F&F tropical mini-vacation; it gave me such a
good excuse to wear all my favorite boxers :)

I also wanted to specifically invite all of you to participate in the
Friends & Family festivities tomorrow. I think one of the things people
have liked about F&F is that you can pretty much come down and do
*anything* you want. In the past people have brought alters, disco balls,
art projects, friends, family, stuffed giraffes, nude guys, blow pops and
bellydancers. There's plenty of room for you to contribute whatever you'd
like to this party. We also always need volunteers to come and help set up
and clean up which also happens to be a great way to meet the people
involved who, for the most part, are all your net friends from right here:
sfr!

F&F is also a great way to experience the amazing collection of talent
we've got here on sfr. Almost very single particpant in this party, from
djs and musicians, to visual artists, alter artists and other artists --
all are from sfr; by the people and for the people. Right On.

that said,
luv phasers on; engage...

:)

see ya 'all tomorrow
ethan

PS: If you want to come down and help we'll be there from 6pm on; call the
info line (415.985.5244) for exact directions.

flowers and other glow-in-the-dark ornaments, bring it to decorate the tree.

I'll also bring some more SFR "do-it-yourself" pins. So, if you missed
"Radio Radio" (shame on you :) or the pin, stop by, say Hi and get your one
('till they last). I'll probably have a dark T-shirt with a big red flower
and the Yin/Yang symbol in the middle.

See ya tomorrow, and "Have a nice rave"

I was wondering if Kommotion accepts donations? Will they be accepting 
donations at Friends and Family ? ( That is , donations in addition to
the recommended $3 ? ). Also , will the donation be tax-deducible?

1)Well, I wasn't going to post it because it's commercial, but since someone
raised the subject, here's another place to order mix tapes:

http://www.gate.net/~undrwrld/xcomp.html

Unfortunately, I am not able to access it today.  They have mostly East
coast stuff, and do trades.  I can't vouch for their reliability or
trustworthiness. 

2)I saw on AP that Microsoft and AP have issued press releases strongly
denying that Bill Gates has bought the RC church.  Maybe Gates doesn't want
the Pope's price to get too high.

3)Crash Worship will return to SF on Friday, Jan. 13.  It will be at a
performance space at 17th and Carolina.

I'm hoping to be 2 places at the same time Sat. night....

In case you all haven't noticed, I'm through with my finals!  I'm now fully 
online once again and plugged in!  Looking forward to the parties this 
weekend and in the coming weeks.  I may not be at F&F, but I will 
definitely be at the Gathering.  Did someone talk about a group picture?  
In front of the dj booth at 2am?  Or was that another list?  Well, I'll 
be there.  No camera, just me.  

ciao professore!

Still got a permagrin :) stuck from last night. It took some time for the
vibe to build up, but by the end everybody was goin fuckin nuts. There was
some different music than a normal Gathering, I hadn't heard Jon Williams
in a while & he played some fast stuff (sorry 135 is fast for me) that
just tore my head wide open. Definatley a *real* Gathering.

Recently I inhaled a rather distressing rumor involving one of my own 
experiences, and I must now attempt to prevent this untruth from spreading 
further.  Freezer provided electronic ambience in the upstairs room of 
the Halloween episode of Megatripolis, and over a month later I find a 
rumor circulating to the effect that Megatripolis did not pay us - this 
offered as evidence of the promoters' business practices.  As always with 
rumors, the truth resembles the tale, but only in part.  At the end of a 
long night and an even longer morning, I prepared to leave the party and 
began to look around for a familiar face connected with the event, in 
order to inquire after any money that may or may not have been left for 
the musicians and DJs in the upstairs room.  Finding no familiar faces 
and being at that point more desirous of sleep than of money - of which I 
had not really been expecting much - I went home.  If Freezer and our 
many collaborators of that evening were not paid, this was the result not 
of the promoters' stinginess but rather of our own lack of effort in 
obtaining payment.  In fact, we found that the Megatripolis crew were 
quite a pleasure to work with, and we were quite pleased that they showed 
such support of the local electronic musi-community in allowing us free 
reign of the upstairs all night.  Neither we nor the other players in the 
upstairs room were after money that evening anyway - we were quite happy 
just to get so many keyboards and drum machines hooked into the same 
sound system and play our sets in a large space to an appreciative 
crowd.  This brings me to the soapbox section of the message:  (1) rumors 
blow around endlessly in our little scene and should be greeted with 
distrust; (2) rumors grow around a kernel of truth which evolves into 
falsehood through repetition and distance; (3) rumors serve to spread 
only confusion, often damaging their subjects and their tellers.  I have 
heard many tales about various promoters and musicians in the scene, 
which stories, upon closer scrutiny, start looking a bit fishy.  One 
person might tell a tale of an interaction with X, and the listener, 
honestly misunderstanding, might then repeat a slightly modified version, 
which then evolves into an inaccurate rumor.  Stories should be checked 
for accuracy before they are offered as nonfiction.  Yes, there are 
predators hovering over the scene - psychic predators, cultural predators, 
financial predators - but we need to make sure of their indentities 
before we go telling tales.  The Megatripolitans put on some nice parties 
with excellent music and low prices, so we should not be directing the 
dark energy of rumor and untruth their way.  Sorry for the soap suds.  
:)  Joshua / Freezer

I have always found Fraser Clark and the friends of his that I have met to
be very integral, mellow, "clued in" people.. I think a lot of their
problems with the local community have to do with the people who
were here about three months ago who I don't really think have anything
to do with Fraser currently.. Oh well..some people just believe
what they want to believe..(and wouldn't know real creativity -or a 
real rave...if it bit them in the ass..)
 
but I really like them and wish Megatripolis had been more successful..

It's easy to criticise others.. harder to do something constructive
yourself...

I think the sfraves community should save it's criticism of promoters
for the ones that really deserve it..

If you get this note, then you're invited. Please don't forward this
anywhere else, but you're welcome to bring friends. Apologies if you
receive duplicates.

--
Date: Dec 31, 1994 -> Jan 1, 1995
Time: 8PM-?
Place: The NEXUS-Berkeley, Berkeley CA
--

	Please join us at the NEXUS-Berkeley while we bring in the new
year, as it happens in New York, Chicago, Anchorage, and other cities
around the continent. (I would include here the Australian sites but
that would require that the party start approx. 7 AM on the 31st...)
	We expect other nexus-locations to be wired into the net along
with us, although the connectivity at the other locations will
probably be minimal. For all I know they might not be wired at all,
leaving us with only our own new years to celebrate. In any case, I
expect to have approximately 7 terminals which people can use to
communicate with the other cities. (Then again, for all I know that
might not happen.. We might not even have -1-... Ah the flux of life.)
	Bring someone to share. (You should also bring some-things- to
share too, like drinks, snacks, etc.)

	Please RSVP for directions. (Mail sameer@c2.org.. I'd like to
get an idea of how many people to expect, etc..)

Thanks.

Ahhh!  My head is still spinning sweetly from such a glorious night!
I got there at about 11:30 and the place was already hopping.  I wish I 
didn't miss Doran's set, but the other dj's made up for it big time.
Spun made his usual grand entrnace, I didn't even have to be at the turn 
tables to see that it was him coming on:)   Tony, as always, just blew me 
away, and I heard some of John Williams' set which was really fast and 
hard core, (and quite good, rather mesmerising) but after dancing for 
several hours, I was ready to chill for 
awhile in the ambient room.  I met up with Jason Sydes from sfraves and 
we and his friend, Gwen kicked back. Soon we had a bunch of people joining 
us; some who I hadn't met before (Ian, Christa, & Ryan) and some who I 
knew, but not very well: one you all know, Tony Garcia (deepfog).  I 
found a deeper plane of friendship in him that night.
After a couple of hours (I think.....length of time is difficult to 
comprehend at a great rave) Tony and I hit the dance floor again and Josh 
was on playing some really upbeat morning music.  I couldn't stop 
dancing!  I've always like the acid trance stuff the best.....but Josh 
and Garth's sets (ESPECIALLY Garth) made me appreciate morning music in a 
whole new way.  From Josh's set til the music stopped, I was held captive 
on the dance floor never once standing still.   When Garth was on and 
that song that was playing when the lights last came on (it was, I was 
told a sort of disco song where they were singing "it's so real")  
Anyway, the vibe was so strong and INTO it and that song.........it just 
literally brought me to tears!! So I was there grinning like a fool, 
dancing like a crazy, and tears streaming down my cheeks! It was bliss!
(I'm getting goosebumps again as I type:)
After the music stopped, I met 2 more people from sfraves: phuture and 
Josh Bates.  I can't wait to meet you guys again soon and actually get to 
talk.       I hope I haven't taken up too much room, just so much to 
tell-you know how it goes. If Friends & Family and Stompy Stomp went off 
like the Gathering, it's a wonder that the whole bay area didn't blast 
off to the moon!!!  
Talk to you all soon,
luv,
Amy

 As I was waiting for the Stompy crew to solve their last-minute setup
problems , I chatted with one of the folks associated with the club. He
mentioned something I thought some of the rave crowd might like to hear.

[ WARNING: I may be paraphrasing this guy poorly , and it was only this
  one fellow, so don't take it as "official" Trocedero opinion ] 

 He mentioned in passing that ravers and rave promoters seem to have a poor
idea of how their actions ( or inactions ) affect the club and its
employees finacially. I didn't go into details with the guy - I wish I 
did. Anybody with experience running a club care to comment?

 Friends & Family & Friends .....

 After a day of holiday shopping , I started my evening by stopping at
Kommotion to help set-up. With the efforts of us all , the music was
playing by 9:15PM. I decided to bug out and check on Stompy Stomp at
the Trocedero , but not before I hand-painted a day-glo heart on one
of the wall-mounted sheets of paper. As I was leaving , Gil and the
Normals  arrived to set up their ambient U-Haul! A great idea - for $20,
a truck can be rented for 24hrs. that can serve as an exterior chill space.

 I found a nice parking space about 30 yards from the Trocedero - as
I was early , I took a nap. Refreshed , I walked up to the door to
find out that it was still closed at 10:10PM . The door guy says "open
in 15 minutes". So , I decide to "CHILL" outside , since the doors
would be open soon. Luckily , DJ Harry Who came by with his box o'
vinyl - he managed to get me in early as a guest. 

 It turned out that doors didn't officially open until 10:50 PM , 50 
minutes after the time on the flyer. Nagging technical problems were
to blame for the Stompy family's delay. 

 The first thing I noticed was the wall-of-sound speaker setup - ten
feet wide and eight feet tall , each wall composed of eight Eastern
Acoustic Works (EAW) speakers , one wall on each side of the turntable
platform. This platorm was unique - suspended at the four corners by
doubled 1/8" cables , reinforced by 2x4s at each end nailed to the 
edge of the stage. No connection to the dancefloor. This was done to 
avoid the vibrations from the floor.

 The system sounded OK to me - I did notice during the night that the
sound did change somewhat depending on location and crowd density , but 
since there was no trouble to move to any part of the club , it was 
no bother. The sound was never distorted - just some bass "tubbiness"
in some spots.

 Harry Who started the night off , so his was the set with the lowest 
audience. Too bad - he did a nice mix of stuff that I had fun dancing to.
During his set , I took a break and checked out the upstairs. They were
still setting up - lotsa bean bag chairs , hip-hop , but no sushi. 

 By the time I left at about 12:30 AM , during John Howard's set. By 
that time , the attendence had increased to about 15 people. A special
Stompy dancer was doing a go-go thing on the big platform - her costume
was a sort of ballerina bird woman with silver beak , silver skirt , and
wispy wings. 

 Back to Friends and Family - SHEESH! It was the most crowded I had
ever seen for a Kommotion F&F event. Shortly after I got there , the
door checker and Bryce had to stop people from coming in. People every-
where. I tried dancing in the crowd , but gave it up after about half
an hour. After milling about some , I escaped to the ambient U-Haul 
truck.

 Seems most of the ambient truckers were SFRavers I know - maybe the 
rest of the crowd didn't know that the truck was "public access"? It was
nice to be in a quieter space - on my second bean bag chair of the night.

 Looked like Friends and Family didn't need my attendence to help with
the great and humid vibe , so I decided to head back to the Troc , which
was underattended when I left. I

 Boy - they didn't need my help either! By this time , Doc Martin was
spinning , and the crowd had increased to about 1.5 times the Friends
and Family crowd! Density was about 9 square feet of dancing area per
person , as opposed to F&F density of about 6.5 square feet per person.
It was a joy to have the additional floor space to do some elbow-jab
free dancing. I saw other "refugees" from F&F - that white haired
couple ( what's their name? do they have a daughter/granddaughter who
raves? ) , Robert , and Derek Chung. 

 The Stompy crowd was in good spirits - no lack of vibe on the dance
floor! I'll have to remember to catch Doc Martin again - I liked a
heck of a lot of what I danced to. The crowd certainly enjoyed his
set , and let him know so vocally.

 More Stompy dancers in different costumes, don't remember the costume
details very well. Upstairs was being fully utilized chill-wise , the
music still hip-hop and trip-hop.   Still no sushi.

 I decided to call it a night at 3:30AM ... as I drove southwards , I
was glad to know that both parties had succeed , attendence-wise. I hope
that they ended OK ( but that's for other folks to report on ...).

 [ Glad to see Frank and "Jump In The Fire" again - long time no see!]

i feel completely electrified and excited about the upcoming new year of '85..

working hard on my thesis project (and not much else..)

Hello - Larry "Not Derek Chung" Ching here -

 For three times in the space of two days , I have been mistaken in one
way or another for Derek Chung . And it's happened before. I'm getting
tired of this . For the use of the rest of the others in SFRaves here's -
-----------------------------------------------------
 A Field Guide To Some Asian-American SFRavers 
 copyright 1994 Larry Ching
-----------------------------------------------------

Philip Chang: Tallest of the A-ASFRs , and taller than many SFRavers .  
                  Mellow vibes generator.

Larry Ching: Oldest known A-ASFR to date. Combs hair back and glues the
                 strands down with cheap gel. Has a distinguishing black spot
                 on his nose located somewhat between his eyes ,  otherwise
                 unusually handsome for such an old fart. Makes occasional lame
          posts to SFRaves , out of porportion to the few actual events
          he actually attends. Stands 5'7" tall , +/- 1/4" .

Derek Chung: Shortest known A-ASFR. Does sterling work gathering information
                  for the weekly SF Raves Calendar.  

Sun Kim: Known mainly for not having a last name that begins with 'C'. Also ,
         does not wear glasses , but may be using contacts (?). Most buff
         A-ASFR , probably due to steroids. 

[ Philip/Derek/Sun - I need more spotting information to flesh out this  
                          A-ASFR  Field Guide - can you guys help  :-\   ]

f&f rocked super hard - lee and ethan get especial props for spinning some
TRULY sick stuff (lee just pummeled my brain with stakker humanoid) and with
superstar dj joe rice behind the ambient decks, you couldn't want for
anything else.

but everything else was there - phenomenal energy, great people, creative
visuals and the whole nine.

way to go!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

THE OFFICIAL SFRAVES SCREENSAVER FOR WINDOWS v1.2:
* THE GATHERING 3 YEAR ANNIVERSARY *
by DJ Dave Alga
FILENAMES: SFRSS12.ZIP & SFRSS12U.ZIP
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Well, we had a blast this weekend.  For all of you who went to
Friends and Family, you sure did miss a great party.  A lot of
our pictures didn't come out this time, due to my promotions
for Cool World, and the lighting in the Richmond Civic Center.
We still managed to get a few good ones for you, and I decided
to add a little color to this one, since the black and white
camera can get a little boring.  Each picture in this pack has
a colorful fractal background.  It's worth the download just
for the fractals.  I went through a lot of work for this one,
and I'm impressed with the results.  SFRSS12U.ZIP is the
pictures only, for those of you who have Mac's or don't run
Windows.  SFRSS12.ZIP is the Screen Saver for Windows.  Have
fun with it, and see you all at Cool World/Funky Tekno Tribe
on New Year's!  I'm playing from 10-11:30pm, so come say hi.
SS version 1.2, like always, is available by FTP to:

hyperreal.com

in directory:

/incoming (when I first release it)

or

/tools/pc/graphics

Keep the scene alive...

To sum things up _This party WENT OFF!_

I arrived around 7:30 to set up my equipment and sound check. The party 
pretty much started then as Ernie,Phred , Ethan and myself played some 
tracks to warm up the old SoundVision system and music was going and 
people were decorating in the ambient room.

It was crowded but the heat wasn't too bad and there was a real nice 
mix of people. There was still a decent size group of diehards when I 
came on at 6am to close things down. The sound was excellent and my ears 
were not ringing even after DJing (that is a very good sign). It was great 
to see so many familiar faces, Lee & Janie Fogel, Giamma & Maura, Gil, 
Ernie,Phred, Joe, Morgan, Tamara & everyone else. Extra special thanx to 
Ethan & Bryce :)

For those few music lovers who made it through my set here's the set list.
It was a blast , can't wait to the next one. Hope to see you all at 
_Begin Again_ on New Year's.

He probably was depressed because of a bad bar take or tip situation
for that night.Our crowd, in general, don't drink much alcohol or
tip very well... These people often earn fairly low wages,in
anticipation of tip income..(which they do make with the nightclub crowd..)
 
These people might make $150 in an average night when you factor in
tips.. but only $50.00 if there weren't decent tips...typically..

ass off (now my back is sore from twitchin and jerkin), met *tons* of
sfravers and lurkers too (you know who u r =).  WOW!  For me it was a
complete gathering of friends and family.  I even ran into a friend who just
flew in from Maui that evening.  Damn.  I don't even know what to say!  So I
guess i'll just say hi and a glad i met you to everyone that I met or saw
there.

     Hiya folks,
     
     Boy this weekend's F&F was so much fun! It was so great to have been 
     able to meet a bunch of you, and see all these SFRavers out having a 
     grinning good time ( Todd S., Robert J.,Milton, Deaks, Bill & Gaby, 
     Brian (Mdma), Cindy( never did get to meet Greg!), Cindy ( SeaofSin ) 
     , and a ton more that I unfortunately cant remember now.... ).
     
     The vibe was just so great, and those big BIG smiles wherever one 
     looked into the crowd..Wheee! It was definitely hella packed, but that 
     sweaty feel was actually kinda fun! VERY hot, VERY primal, and VERY 
     fun! When Deaks put on his set, it took me to another level....Awesome 
     set dude! Especially that tune, "The Shini", by Elevator. Wow, what a 
     great track! Gotta get it :) !
     
     Well, gotto do some work...   (: Keep up that great vibe folks :)
     
     Sy

Ann queries:
>ps what's up with the full moon thing?

Well, as I walked out of Komotion to evaporate some love drops of sweat, in
the late am fog, I saw a shy, sultry moon dance low over the horizon, ready
to give the sky back to the sun. And walking back in, I knew this had been
my full moon. Deaks set had peaked my night, and I imagined hearing him
again on a beach in Monterey, blowing my bubbles over a happy crowd, and as
my starry eyes cleared, Bryce showed up in the foreground, grinning at two
young, experienced ravers, and said  "well, tonight WAS the Full Moon, and
we've been celebrating it and ourselves tonight" or something pretty damn
close, if happy memory serves.

There's part of your answer, girl! The rest, well, after an hour more of
work, I'll spill mah beans!

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the "Oh, so satisfied" E-Bee..........

We got to F&F early, a little after 10 and had a lot of fun dancing to
Gil's set, socializing with friends and meeting some new ones.  Things
got a bit too cramped for us later on, so we ended up spending a lot of
time in the ambient annex truck.  We ended up having so much fun just 
hanging out and socializing that we just couldn't get motivated to head 
out to the Gathering as was our original plan.  Good work everyone; What
a great weekend for the entire scene!

Wow. Friends & Family was totally *nuts*; sick, sick, sick, sick! +)
Jam packed and bubbling with just psycho vibe.

Music was phenomenal all night. With a few notable exceptions, the lineup
in both rooms was composed almost entirely of *unknowns* and lemme tell
you, they all went crazy. Jamie's opening set in the chill room was prolly
the best chill set I've ever heard. Soul, R&B, Motown, Funk & House all
rolled into one, truly great! Gil, Jeyson, Lee, Ernie, Phred, Ronan, WBL,
Freezer, Brian and Laura, Joe Rice, Mohsen and Michael; all were fantastic!

Visuals were out of this world: two screens of meclay madness, wonderful
real time graffiti, wall hangings, posters, suns, moons, stars, oil
projections... :)   :)

Many, many thanks to *everyone* that helped in making this one go so off.
There are way too many of you to mention without forgetting someone; you
know who are :) Extra, extra special thanks to our pre- and post-clean up
crews. The place looked (and smelled) wonderful! And coiling cables by dawn
in the tropical komotion mud requires a truly special breed of person;
thank you all!

Also to Komotion who really stretched their boundaries for us on this one.
The enire joint was fully packed with a huge line outside most of whom,
unfortunately, were unable to get in. Definitely our biggest party yet. If
you can't get flattened by the 3 year gathering and a stompy stomp, I think
you're there :) Glad to hear, however, that all three went so totally off.
Does SF rule or what? ;)

see ya next time

...whatever that means.

So: after a long absence involving the release of my arcade game, a
month-long odyssey across the US on a bright red motorcycle, a
$100,000 lawsuit, and some other stuff, I finally had my chance to
dance.  After Saturday, I have several questions:

1) Deaks, man: you blew up!  Where'd all that come from?  Woke me up from
sleeping behind the piano!

2) Will the Glowing Mouth become the new trend in all-night energy boosters?
Bonus: it's hard to project a 'tude when your lips are fluorescent green.

3) Just where _did_ Milton get that hat?

4) What happened to that huge five-foot fan that Komotion used to have?
I know I missed it.

5) Is it my imagination, or has the F&F hug quotient increased over its
last few incarnations?

6) Why did I have to miss so many of these?  Damn.

It's great to be back.  Thanks to everyone for being there: if I tried to
name everyone I'd go nuts.  You know who you are.

...and in case anyone wonders, I was the tall guy in biker shorts with the 
long ponytail and the Van Dyke -- and occasionally the tiger shirt and 
bubble kazoo.

What? I've been cloned without even knowing. Oh well, atleast they can't
clone my records... I hope :)

I guess the upshot of bobbo's story is that Megatripolis promised payment
for his performance and didn't deliver.  Whether or not you stick around
to receive your compensation, it seems to me that the requestor of the
service ought to get in touch with the provider and set things straight
one way or the other.

In this scene, making money is not the primary motivator of many of the
people involved.  But it's still important for the integrity of the
house/techno/rave scene overall that obligations are satisfied and that
those who do want to make money don't take advantage of those who do not.

OK. It looks like we finaly got the lineup for the winter solstice set.
in no particular order ...
Harry Who? : Jeno : Josh : Rick Preston : Spun : Markie : Tracy : Thomas 
Garth : Galen : Solar : Unknown 

It's going to start Tuesday night/ Wednesday morning at midnight, and go
till midnight Wednesday night. A full 24 hours. There's going to be some
outdoor spot for people who can't get it in to go and listen with their
car stereo's & boomboxes, people with good systems are especialy
encouraged to go :) The info # is 267-1865
The #'s 90.1 and it can be reached south to San Jose, north to SSF (some
people can get it in the city), east to some parts of Oakland & Berkeley
hills. If you want to test if you can get it in you can call the dj and ask
him what he's playin' @ 723-9010.

I don't quite understand the comment you heard at the Troc, Larry.  Did
it mean that ravers don't drink enough?

What a great party!  And after a lot of agonizing over my first set for
any large group, I felt pretty good about it.  Deaks wrecked my strategy
by *ripping* it up in his set, so I couldn't go with Plan A (spacey trancey)
or Plan B (tribal funky) so it was Plan C after all (details below).
Next time I'll remember to bring a small towel, I was dripping wet before
I put the second record on.  Hope y'all enjoyed it, I sure did.  More
comments in another posting.  Here's my setlist as best I can reconstruct
it (pending a listen to the tapes) . . .

  Spirit - Space Child
  Boomtang - Nyika Nyika
  Heitor - Ligeirin
  Whoosh! - Sometimes
  Speedy J - Beam Me Up
  Susumu Yokota - Hi
  Wintermute - Bushman
  Rebound - Rock the House
  Vibe Tribe - Dance With Me
  Blunted Chimps - Get It On
  Head Nodding Society - Deeper
  Fluke - Bubble
  Quest - Now Will You Believe
  Airfix - Stick To It
  Peyote Dreams - State of Mind
  Needle Park - Crossfire
  Sensation - Beautiful Morning

Well, knowing that the Groove Kitchens
don't get going very early I went by a suburban
early eighties metal theme party (nicely done)
to chomp on mini-corndogs and play silly
drinking games (Coors Light, of course)

I suppose a party like that seems charming if
(1) you've been to real ones (2) it's been quite
a long time since you've been to a real one.  ;-)
Anyway, I'm kinda into dramatic contrasty evenings, it 
makes a city nightclub all the more fabulous, full immersion
then brings on some of that overwhelming innocent awe ...

Off to Stompy we go - there were no lines around 2 and
the party was Cookin - I love walkin into a Hotbox Frenzy!
They made the Troc a little cozier than I've seen before with 
the stage being occupied by a big screen; the speakers and dj table 
were kinda sticking out onto the dance floor, and this great dancer
platform/cage-like thing was smack in the middle of everybody.
I liked the more intimate atmosphere.

The dancers and costumes were fantastic.
The first one I saw was the Angel Bird Lady
who was just Frozen into the most inspirational
graceful pose.  She was Flyin ...  there were several
dancers and they each did multiple costume changes.  
They took live video of em and spiced up the
otherwise ho hum ravey visuals on screen.

I caught the last of John Howard (burnin off that Coors Light)
and was pretty loose for Doc Martin.  He played for about 4 hours
which presumably gave me a good intro to his stuff and I think he
worked up into a nice groove.  It was all good.  Freestyle, richer
sounding House?  There were lots of rythm changes and the music
would abrubtly vary itself - wild at times.  The sound was
good - not everywhere, but you could certainly find
places with room to move and your level volume.

The crowd was friendly and definitely Older.
Lotsa very cute folks, lotsa dancing, lotsa playful cynicism.
It was very loose and sloppy.  This was partly the music, I guess,
but I noticed a whole bunch of down right silliness.  It was hard
not to dance in a super-goof splashy manner.

Love ya,
Dave

Mijos, FFV had all ages of joy packed into that space. Not one cop, not one
goon. Not one incident. 

I don't know if anyone has had trouble with the curfew law, and I believe
it won't be used at all, unless someone complains. Then, it seems, one of
SF's finest will pull that out and slap it in our face. 
But that may never happen, especially since we rarely contest a bust
enough. So, as of now, we can breath easy and keep quiet.
 Now, does anyone know a raving lawyer (vs. a stark raving mad lawyer)? No
lawyer jokes, please,  but we could really use someone to look fer nasty
little loopholes and beat THEM at their own game. 
Toodle-loo

Wow what a nice event thanks to Bryce and Ethan for organizing with 
Komotion and the whole collective.  At one point someone asked me if I 
was working there as I went upstairs to turn on my light that I had 
brought, and later Tim commented that everyone was working, just look at 
the dance floor you think those people aren't working here!!  Deaks tore 
me up I really enjoyed parts of Jason and LeeAn's sets and the end of 
Phred's set, some nice things happening in the ambients area's (notice 
plural).  I met some great people and had the best time in a while.  This 
was the best event I've been to in SF in quite awhile maybe as long as a 
year or so this one may be in the top 5 of '94,  or top one!!
 
Once again thanks to everyone who participated, which is eveyone who 
came, I saw so many smiles and hugs and found myself giving hugs out too, 
uncontrollably at times, i hope to see this again soon.

Love and Hugs Scott

Damn, they just get better and better. Definately the most consistently

really dug the stuff being played in the back around midnight - was that

Next time, I gotta wear a dress, though. =)

As always, it went OFF and it just seems to keep getting better!!  I had to 
leave around 4, in preparation for a drive to Santa Barbara, but things were
ragin' and bumpin' and I could barely tear myself away to go!

I brought along a "rave virgin" friend and I think he's hooked.  He can't
wait until the next one either.  :)  Thanks to everyone who made it happen,
I'm just always so amazed at how great everything always turns out, and the
amazing vibe we're able to create!  I got so many hugs and met so many
wonderful sfravers and non-sfravers alike (you know who you are!) that even
though I was sick as a dog I still felt great.  :)  I even got smiles and
hugs from some gangsta types who were sorta glaring around - it's amazing
what a little jolly rancher and a big smile will do.  :)

Thank you again to everyone who made friends & family a reality and everyone 
who contributed to the great vibe, especially the dj's and everyone I got a big
ol hug from.  *grin*  OH and especially whoever gave me those popsicles
sometime around 3.  ***BLISS***  Thank you thank you thank you to everyone.
This is what it's about.  This is IT.

k

p.s. in case you don't remember I'm the one with the braids and jolly
ranchers and the big BEE on my shirt.  *beam*

whats that mean? Like if I wear a garter and fishnets, he's gonna go broke?

Seeing their regular line-up on other nights (punk shows, gwar, bondage
a-go-go) I now understand why security treats us (especially me!) like
shit. They get a rowdy, drinking (=$$$$) crowd every night, then we go in
and skip the bar, they see the chill room and can only watch, and they
stand out and get no attention (vs. go-go nights where  security wears
shirts saying "sex police" and people might even look up to them).

And then I go in there in my pajamas! Sweet bejeezus! (read:sheesh!)

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....

ps. the go-go info comes from an sfraver and good friend who really hates
it when I wave his name around, so if you read this, mijo, go ahead and
grin in your anonymity!

F&F was killer.  I even managed to stay awake until 5:30, which is a
recent record for me.  I danced so hard to Ethan's set and to the bits
of acid at the end of Ernie's that I pulled a muscle in my leg.  You should
see me limp :-( .  Man, when I was in the back of the main room with
MikeBee, Steve B., Ovid, and everyone else whooping and screaming along
with the squaking aceeeeid noises I felt that special energy and excitement
that I'd just been too tired and cynical to feel lately.

It's amazing what havok we (all of us together) have wrought.  Stay tuned
for a great '95!

 Hmm! That's right! You do make people smile at you, even if you don't, if
yer teeth and lips glow. I think this may be a new tool to disarm 'tooders
and cruisers! 
 If anyone noticed, there were 5 or 6 guys in from the mission (yes, I am
going by appearance/accent, but I am latino so shut up) that may have just
stumbled  upon the line outside by accident and decided to check it out,
hey it's 3 bucks, right?
 And they were on those stairs, kinda watching the party and bobbing their
heads, but kinda drawn back. Defensive, you know, the railing as a barrier
and safety in close numbers! But they laughed at me and I let them know it
was ok to do that. They wanted some E, but of course, this ain't yer
buyer's market. But not to let them down, I gave them some rue. 
 And then it happened. They came off the stairs, danced, and my anonymous
friend(you know who you are) saw one of them, green lips and all, TRANCE
OUT and lock into the rythm and spiral off into that other world. 
 Makes me really warm and even a little smug when that happens, that
someone can stumble across this and the vibe be so strong it draws them in,
and they fit right in after a while. Hope their next party is a good one,
too.
Maybe in a few more parties, they might come back in drag with me. And hit
up on the security at the troc "hey, big boy! Is that a mag-light, or are
you just happy to see me?"

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

yeah! What is this? Ethan, you get all whipped up about a small change in

The scene being the gardening club, mijo. Monday nights have something
good, that won't hurt your back or knees. A chill party that packs
surprises, new music, they ain't afraid to displease! And perhaps the best
beat I ever heard in my life, at 2:30 am last week (who was that guy?).

The place: carribean zone
The price: 3 papayas (so you can leave early to sleep without feeling ripped)
The age discrimination: 18+ 
The time: 11pm to 3 am
Security: NO ANGRY SAMOANS (no lights in yer face, either)
Toilet: sittable to 2 am
Seats: forget it, it gets packed now, it's no little 'ol thing anymore.
What to do: drag yer ass in, catch a  Synergy viz, go "who is that awesome
dj" and hang out with the best.

So is anyone coming?

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

I was curious about the black spray paint outside of the paper in the

Seriously, if you go to the thrift shop, dudes, the big chicks don't part
with their clothes! It's so hard to find used women's clothing that fits.
But if you do, spend your time, and find the dress that is undeniably you. 

Then, 3 hours later, you will know "so this is why it takes so long for
women to shop." it's all true, bu! And don't be afraid, you won't be any
less a man. Unless your parents see you.

	OK Folks we have a chance at actually pulling this thing off.
	But I need some help.  Does anyone have an Indy that we could 
	borrow for 24 hours? Or some other workstation that is capable
	of doing a stereo broadcast?  If not, a mono will just have to do.

	I need to talk to someone who has done this before, preferably
	a person that has used the public domain software.

	Please contact me if you can help, we go on the air at Midnight
	tomorrow!

Is the real KLF really playing on New Year's?
Is Bill Drummond going to be there?
Inquiring minds want to know.
It would be pretty intense if they are and he is.

Yes, that really is KLF performing at Cool World on New Year's.  It's
their first appearance in the Bay Area EVER.  They're on at 11:30,
and are bringing on the New Year.  DON'T miss em...  I can't wait.

Yeah right!  The KLF won't be there, it's going to be Wanda Dee (who
did some vocal snippets on a couple tracks off the White Room)
lipsynching to a DAT.  The KLF broke up over a year ago and Drummond
and Cauty have moved onto other things.  What a total scam...

ok guys.. this is serious...

DJ Dave as a member of the Cool World has stated that the KLF is gonna be there.
Andy and many others say noooooooooo.....

does Cool World fall down in ignominy (I like that word.. I paid $2 for it 
at a yard sale)... or they will soar in our esteem..(well mebbe raise a little 
in my esteem).... 

Any confirmations..?????

all's i know is the flyer says "THE K L F  experience     with
                                                        Wanda Dee"
 
(note that KLF is in very BIG type, experience is kinda blurred, and
"with Wanda Dee" is very much not the focus.  reads like a cover band
to me, but who am i to say if it's real?)

your guess is as good as mine.

ummm, no. this is NOT, repeat, NOT the KLF. it is sometime vocalist for 
the KLF, Wanda Dee parading around as 'the KLF experience'. No jimmy. no 
bill. no fun. i hate to let ya down like this but old wanda has been 
fooling concertgoers for at least a year and a half now. if the only 
reason yo'ure going to cool world is to see this, skip it at *all* costs, 
cause it ain't worth it to watch an out-of-work diva shimmy her way 
through a DAT of another bands' classics.

No, it is *not*.  It is the "KLF Experience featuring Wanda Dee", which 
means a former backup singer crooning over tapes of KLF music without 
Drummond or Cauty's permission at all.  You might as well have "The 
Velvet Underground Experience featuring Nico" with Nico singing over some 
old VU albums.  Drummond and Cauty have not performed as the KLF in over 
two years, and they don't have the money to fight a legal fight against 
Wanda Dee and her record label over the copyright infringement involved 
here.

Hi everyone, I am recovering from a real letdown.  The terminal I am on 
seemed to lose an entire page of email i typed.  Oh well; I think deep 
breathing might help.  

Anyway, I wanted to express why the Gathering worked for me.  Partly it
was because I have not been out in a while.  Partially because of the
music.  Partially because of
amywilljasontiffydanomaddyscottywhittsitttylerjuliandavejasonianalexvlad
and others that I can't think of right now.  I think the only sfr people 
there were Josh Bates who I didn't meet :< and Phuture.  

The music was incredibly delicious.  And so were those cappucinos.  

I think the best sets personally were Josh and Garth.  Tony's was good 
too, but I really have been into Garth the last few times I've heard him. 

So you all take care, 
I will see you out there.  
:>

love and vinyl goodness, 
deepfog

	I have a brief question, which I am sure is flamebait...

but.

	Where does DJ Dave Alga get off saying his screen saver is the
'official' sfraves screen saver? Is there some sfraves committee that
makes it official? Just 'cause it's available from ftp on hyperreal
that makes it official? I thought sfraves was an elist, not a body
granting officialness to things.

	Sorry if this is old news, and has been hashed out
before.. its just really annoying. If someone could email me privately
if it's been hashed out before I'll be quiet.

Oh mah gawd! Relax people!
 Let's thank cool world for providing a place for those with tastes
different from most of us on sfraves and most of those we meet at parties.
I'm sure anyone who identifies with the  CW flier and both the obvious and
subliminal info on it ("intelligent lighting") will enjoy their party. It
is $20, all of us have paid that for a new years wicked or a Martin party,
many of us have been to FTT (and they are there on Alga's boat). 
 Yes, it's commercial. It's a little on the velveeta side. And there IS
mind fucking on the flier (klf experience!hmpf!). I for one will not go to
an event that insanely huge even to see Zeus display his lightning
collection, if I have to put up with the rest of the crap. But that's my
taste. Most people going there don't know KLF, don't care, will be in
another"arena" or will be so whacked they won't even care. Or they just
wanna rock and their friends are there.

Lots of them will be happy at the end.
Lots will have new friends. 
Lots will have puked out that chilli they sell there.

But if he's still in business, that means he's got a market.  Good for him.
But Dave, you gotta level at least with us. Don't try to smoke us; and
people, don't say "go to wicked, that's a real rave." Cow palace security
is kinder, gentler, than what wicked and DV8 will have hired.DV8 porta
potties will have hundreds of people puking bunk e, hordes of kids will be
against the wall freakin on three hits of lucy, and the big, angry samoan
will be looking for my ass.
 But my ass is gonna be at the Pacific party, or "down" in Monetery/SC at
the cloud factory. New years is gonna rock for everyone, everwhere. Depends
on why you do what you do.
 Think about it, sugars.

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....

NO, it's not really the KLF.  If you look at the flyer rather than
listening to the Live 105 hype, it's "The KLF Experience Featuring
Wanda Dee" which is NOT Drummond and Cauty.

Last time Wanda and co. pulled this Drummond and Cauty's agent or 
manager or whatver was looking to put an injunction on Wanda Dee
for false advertising.

Laura
P.S.  Wanda Dee did some vocals for the KLF, so that's how she's
claiming a connection . . . .

Unless you can produce me a contract signed by Drummond and Cauty
saying that they are REALLY going to be there, and not "The KLF 
Experience Featuring Wanda Dee" as written on the flyers I saw
at Ameba, I don't believe it one bit.

You know Milton, that is just the greatest thing to hear.  Actually I do
believe that most people are hungry to "let go" and be themselves.  There
is no better place than at a rave such as F&F's to do that.

>Maybe in a few more parties, they might come back in drag with me.

You wish.:) :)  Well......one step at a time here.  I think that the nude
guy at F&FII (yes a long time ago) had the idea.  Let's just take it all
off.  Afterall the heat at F&F is intentional (isn't it?).  By the way,
what ever happenned of the nude guy anyway.

One thing is, I really missed not going to F&FV as I was out of town.  Hope
to see lots of you this New Year maybe Chirstmas Eve?

PS.: Hope to meat you soon Milton.  You sound just way too wild for your
own good. Aarrrrhh! =>

Ok since I was there and I haven't posted in a while(work,work,work)
Killer sound, massive stacks that just slowly lure you closer and closer.
 Pounding and clean.
John Williams spun an incredible high speed hardcore set(isn't he usually
slow and funky?). It worked for me better than any other hardcore set I've
heard recently.  I think I hurt myself though...
I'm not sure where I was during Josh's set but I liked it.
Garth can really rip it up(like we don't know THAT) I think he must've had
the echo cranked all the way on I I Feefeeel Luuuuuluuuluulove but it was
truly brilliant in timing, feel and groove.  I could  feel massive waves of
love/vibe flowing outwards through the crowd and right through my body/mind.
You gotta wonder if there were special nights in those old disco years when
everything clicked and they acheived escape velocity. Hi deepfog and I
finally met Amy.
And I'm in love with Mickey Mouse and that angel(seriously, she had these
incredible 4 foot long wings, feathery platform shoes, and short shorts. How
do they know I dreamed that just the other night?)
See ya out there,
phuture

Another addition to the Asian-American SFRavers Field Guide :

 Willis Wong : Seen in South Bay environs , although can range as far
  north as San Francisco and Richmond. The blond dancing machine !

 ( Slipped my mind Willis - sorry! Also , my apologies to any females

There's hardcore in San Francisco now?  NO WAY!!!!!!  

YIPPEEEEE!!!!!!

Do you mean hardcore like breakbeat?  Hardcore like what we call hardcore
on the East Coast?  Or do you just mean honest-to-god techno?

(Trying not to get too excited, but being a techno and hardcore lover it's
not easy to stay calm.)

Thanks Larry, althogh the only thing people confuse me with is being 
German or Swedish.  
"I'm Chinese"
"No, you're not!"
"Oh"

Sorry I missed all those 17th parties.  Sounds like wild whackiness ensued.

Gotta weird question for you all:
Every time I come home from a rave, I am SOOO pale and washed out 
looking.  Does anybody know why that is?  Is it maybe the obvious like 
missing an entire night's sleep and dancing alot? Or does acid or e 
contribute specifically to looking ashen.  Just curious, cuz I REALLY 
noticed when I was coming home on Sunday morn.

        Acid and E totally pale you out. While I'm on one or the other and
I look at myself in the mirror I notice that my face is totally washed out
and my pours are wide open.
        It happens to everyone..
        Not to worry

After The KLF Experience popped up, Mr Drummond and Mr Cauty 
purportedly burned a million pounds, 
(you know.. literally taking 1,000,000 pound notes and taking
matches to them for a really wierd smelling bonfire)
so they did supposedly have the money to do it in the first place,
and if they don't now, it's pretty much their own fault.

Dont use the really white e.. 
remember we talked about the stuff wid the brown spots in it...
use that.. so then u won't look so pale..u'll sorta have a tan.
They're presently experimenting with e that has red spots in it 
instead of brown spots as this would make us northern europeans 
have rosy red cheeks after raves.

glad to be of help

Now calm down Laura, you know as well as I do that anything above 135 bpm
qualifies as 'hardcore' in SF!!!  I finished my set Saturday night around
134 bpm so I was just below the magic line :)

And Deaks spun out around 140 bpm, so I guess that counts as *real*
hardcore (or Deaks' Breaks, in that case :) :)

Hiya! 

A new south bay weekly has cropped up at a place called 
The Spot, somewhere on Auzerais, maybe Auzerais @ San Carlos?
It's starting tonight with DJ's:

Mei Lwun, Gravy, and Robert Rankin'

I think it's either $3 or $5. 

Sorry the infos so sketchy- I misplaced the flier.
Oh, yeah- 21+ 

Check it out!

Jocelyn

p.s. i managed to make a short trip to SF the 17th- went 
to Stompy, ran into Michael Wertheim (sp?), thought I saw 
Larry, but wasn't too sure. really bummed i missed f&f, but 
friends voted Stompy, so stompy it was. I felt a bit overwhelmed 
and/or out of pplace- last time i ventured into SF was for the last 
blue3- yikes! Glad to hear everything orbited! 

Also, if I go tonight (I've been sick since Monday), 
i'll probably be wearing a greyish/silver 
dress- I'm short, have medium length light brown hair- i'll 
surely be wearing some patent leather shoes & also more than likely 
a bright orange jacket- please say hello!

My two cents:

KLF would never play with Wanda Dee!

Just by billing "KLF featuring Wanda Dee" admits that it is bullshit.

It is good to see that so many people relize that this is a total lie and
scam.

Cool World is trying to cash in . . . by ripping everyone off.


Whatever everyone does this new year's, I hope you all have fun! 

Be safe. Be Smart.

I have a couple NY's eve questions ...


>Saturday, December 31st - 
>Cyberlab 7, Pacific, Synalogic & friends present  !BEGIN AGAIN!

What is with Pacific and this Cyber-Spacey business?
I heard they have an indoor space pretty guaranteed bust free that
is somehow thru the Cyberlab 7 people (whoever they are).  But is the
party gonna be more techno/cyber theme'd than their usual Sunshine and
Happiness affairs??  Will it be 21+, 18+, or maybe a loose 18+?  They
can't technically do a permitted all ages all night anymore or did
that curfew stuff apply to 18-21 yr olds? ... hmm, maybe I haven't
been paying much attention lately ;) 

a $10 , indoor, not-overly-cyberspace party sounds kinda nice

A similar party was thrown last year - it was of order $20 and
outside of 55 Natoma?  So the purple pa could sound mighty nice
under the freeway but what was the comment I read about long lines
last time?  Are we talking *hours* if I get there around 1:00?
This party pulled a large "lets go dancing on NY's @ dv8 crowd" 
so the "vibe" was watered down in some people's opinions??
Plenty o folks out in their holiday finest, I'd imagine.
This'll likely be 21+ ??

Well, further speculation is welcome as well as details of last
years wicked DV8 gathering !!

thanks in advance,
Dave


PS - Joe Rice, I know your body type and I have to recommend a Wrap dress.
Go for a Diane VanFostenberg (sp?) original - they are truly Fabulous!!
Let your chest hair just say it All ...

Re: KLF - I heard 2 weeks ago that this was some studio singer dancing
around to canned KLF songs.  Seems like just about everyone has heard
that also!!

Hey there Ethan!       

Didn't mean to be blabbin about a secret spot - and I just assume
that people will be discrete as necessary.  I am curious about the
collaborative effort, who those other folks are, and general speculation
about cyberiness of this upcoming bash!

Hi from downunder!

i am from australia and was wondering what the general price of a rave is 
these days.  i know it is not the topic of the moment but i just thought 
that i would ask.  For this New Years Eve, the price for a rave to be 
held within a club is AUS$15 which is pretty cheap.  However for a rave 
that will be held in a "secret" location - probably in a warehouse or in 
a paddock somewhere it is going to be AUS$45.00!  This is a really 
outrageous price for a rave here as most of the ones held are usually 
about $20-$30 Australian.

Comments?

If there are any of rules travel, they are the following:
	Theorem: Never look at your hands.
	Corollary: Never stare at your face in the mirror.

Follow these rules, and you will have many happy trips.

If you're concerned w/ how you look afterwards, take a picture of
yourself, and look at it the next day. I mean, you didn't think the
faces appearing in the walls and the weird melting and blooming
graffitti in the bathroom were real, did you? Pay no attention to the
man (or woman) behind the curtain!

I WAS THERE I WAS THERE!!! I saw Sun, who I haven't seen in a while, and 
went to the DJ booth at around 2:00 am (someone had mentioned trying to 
get a photo at that time,) and then decided that without a pair of thick 
glasses and a pocket protector no one was going to recognize each other 
as a SFRAVER/computer geek, so I danced for awhile and then headed back 
to the chill room where I spent most of the night.... lots of hugz and 
touches goin on..... :)

G'day, you should have noted that an Aus $ is about US $.78...

Maximum price here is about $25 for a "massive" warehouse rave...

AUS $45 is a little on the high side, I hope they make 'em good!

In lieu of a Christmas Card, I give you this message about friendship in
the harshest of realities.  As you read it, consider that the "I" and the
"You" in the story are layered deep.  They represent our friendship, and
every friendship you and I have ever had.  "I" and "You" are also like
looking at a wire frame box when your eye can't decide whether its looking
at the bottom or the top of the box and the percieved orientation keeps
shifting with every thought.  At the same time, " I" is definitively me,
and "You" is definitively you because how would I have known anything about
friendship if I had never met you? Enjoy.

The Bus Ride
By Purple Tiger
Dedicated to the public domain and ravers everywhere.

With Christmas rapidly approaching, I find myself wanting to share with
you, as my closest of friends, my contentment and satisfaction with the
human race.  I didn't always feel this way.   There was a time in my life
where it seemed that I was strapped immobile to the seat of a school bus
traveling faster than comprehension towards the only brick wall in a
million miles of featureless asphalt.  You were screaming, I was screaming,
we all were screaming but bus driver didn't care.  He was mesmerized, it
seemed, by the brick wall on the horizon and the promise of a final
destination.

I can't even say that I remembered getting on the bus.  Somewhere,
impressed in a history of chemical modulations, is a vague memory of my
parents helping me onto the bus with a ticket stamped "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."   I
can't blame Mom and Dad that much, the atmosphere was a little thick that
day and the brick wall was just a fuzzy jag on the horizon.  It's hard to
be afraid of a fuzzy jag.

I got tired of screaming after a while, and, as you sat in the seat next to
me, you seemed to too.  We broke out the Alphabet Yatzee game and played a
few rounds.  Inevitably words like "NUCLEAR WINTER" and "BIOSPHERE
DESTRUCTION" rolled onto the board a few times, but they didn't seem to be
any different than the other words, except that we never tried to tally the
points on the letters and we were quick to throw them back into the cup.
When we first started, we used to say the words as they came up.  Then one
day you said the word "SPECIES EXTINCTION" and even before the word
finished you started to cry.  The sorrow almost killed you then.  In our
ignorance we didn't know that a spoken word could carry so much power.  I
turned away from you then because I couldn't stand to see you in pain, and
to hide my shame because I was glad it was you who discovered this horrible
truth, and not me.  We stopped saying the words then, and used only the
board to play the game.  That was when we noticed that the rest of the bus
had already discovered for themselves the difficulty of speech, and with
the final silence of our voices, the only sound left was click clack of the
game and the whoosh of the road.  That was when it became my turn to cry.

As the trip wore on (do you remember when we naively called it a journey?),
and the wall got closer, it got easier to keep one eye on the window and
one eye on the game board.   We lived a strange duality then, half of
ourselves transfixed by the approaching wall and the other half playing the
game.  If one ignored the fact that we never faced each other and only half
our faces were smiling, the ride took on the seeming of a normal bus ride.
Even now I can look on that time and say I was truly half-happy, and glad
to have someone to play the game with.  It was better than the alternative.
Do you remember the man in the next row with both eyes forward and a smile
like a bus driver on his face?  I remember when I almost became like that
man, but before I could completely fade away, you slapped me and screamed,
"Don't Leave Me!" to bring me back.  It was also the only time you touched
me, and the only words you've ever said to me.  I will cherish that moment
forever.

I can't say when it happened, but I do know when I noticed.  I remember
when the brick wall slid slightly away from the crack in the windshield.  I
often used the crack as a reference for locating the wall against the
horizon.  At first I thought that the glass had distorted slightly from the
heat of our passage and lamented the loss of a previously dependable site.
With no other landmarks to use as a reference, it was the only thing I
could believe.  As time passed it became clear that no distortion in the
view could account for the ever increasing change.  About that time, my
other eye noticed a slight change in the corded muscles of your neck and a
subtle slowing in your labored breath.  I feared you were sick and started
to worry.  It is with amusement now as I realize that you were only
starting to relax.  Your body had started to hope even before your mind
knew there was a reason.

It feels so different now.  Today I saw the bus driver take his first
breath since I started this ride and his pallor is starting to redden
slightly.  I believe these are good signs.  Blinking can't be far away for
him, I'm sure of it.  I also saw both your eyes for the first time today,
no brick wall, no game board, just your eyes.  We couldn't look long
because the moment was too intense for the both of us.  We haven't spoken
yet because our mouths are still thick with decades of disuse.   We can
hear words being spoken in the back of the bus, but the riders in the back
haven't been on the bus as long as you or me.  Still I'm in no hurry, the
words will come soon.

One of the riders in the back is talking about a party when we drive past
the wall.   Can you imagine?  A party?  We might even get to meet the man
in the next row, or exchange words with the bus driver.  So, will you dance
with me as the red brick wall passes and doppler shifts even redder in the
rear view window?  Will you stand with me as we stare at the ever bluer
horizon in front of us?  Will you hold my hand as we journey into a future
we want to remember?  Do you want to hear me say the words that I've been
throwing onto the board?  Do you?

"I" "Love" "You" "My" "Friend"
"Merry" "Christmas"

Thanks for the advice, Brian. What about capsules?  I took a capsule on 
Sat. Night.  Being part Swedish, I don't need anymore red in my skin! :)

Maybe some extra *Vitamin* E, being a brown oil, would balance
the unwanted pallor.

Coca-cola is also a great during raves and is a marvelous
source of brown.

Or if a more festive result is desired, consider the colored varieties
of Tums (r).  The pink, yellow, or green would go nicely.  And, of 
course, Tums balance acid nicely.

Thanx PT; where there is life, there is hope.  Although we may never
see our ideals become real,  we can journey together in their direction 
and share with each other the joy of forever getting closer to the dreams 
that make the reality of Now worthwhile and meaningful to us.

FFV was punk rock! ambient uhaul 3$ diverse crowd lesser known djs - I 
peaked there and then at 4:30 am went to stompy stomp. I was really 
impressed by the set up and             Thomas was awsome "whole lotta 
love " this time.





Last night after helping the pie man be santa clause at bondage a go go
(I saw some ravers there , shame shame) I went to the 111 minna party
and I must say it is great to party in an art gallery.

I got out of the RED today thank you all!!!!

     Hi all!
     
     Umm, does anyone know how I can get a "invite" to AGAPAE thats 
     happening Friday night? I wanna go out dancing one last time this 
     weekend on Friday, and this looks like the most fun thing happening, 
     but their tele number seems to indicate a 10 dollar donation *as well* 
     as an invite is necessary to get in....?????? They already posted the 
     location, so I figure just walking up to the door wont do....
     
     Thanks a million guys & gals!
     And of course, (: keep 'em smiling :)
     
     :)

Played at this last night in Sebastopol(!) of all places. Driving up I
figured it would be surprising if more than 10 people were there or it'd be
a regular club type crowd, but it turned out to be great! The crowd had
almost as much energy as the typical F&F crowd, although their average age
seemed to be on the early side of 18. (It was at a coffeehouse) The
promoters are very friendly and care about what they're doing. This first
one was free - I think future parties will be $3. They're throwing more
Sonoma county events New Year's Eve, Wed. Jan 4th and Sat. Jan 7th. (plug:
I'll be playing on the 4th and 7th - dance, not ambient)

415.789.8452 for info.

well, despite health considerations- i made it to the spot last night:
it was wonderful! and certainly has won my own sfraves stamp 
of approval: be forwarned though: a rave it was not. a fantastic 
mixture of location, atmosphere, people and music it was! 

i arrived at 10:30- the first thing you see upon entering the door 
and turning toward the really nice door woman is the bar (ok, to many 
this will seem negative, but please hold them horses) i've lost my id 
and 'til the new one arrives in the mail-
i'm dependent on an old, torn photo driver's license from Texas 
that expired in `88, coupled with my temp driv. lics. with no photo,
and, failing that, la piece de resistance- my work badge- when I 
began to explain, the door woman smiled, waved my papers away and
said, "I trust you." Thanks! I gave her my $3, she gave me a 
drink ticket (yep- your first drink, whatever it is, is on the house-
no limitations, but i talked to the owners and they said they were only 
going to do this once or twice more). Some friends were standing/
seated near the bar, so I went up to say hi, then turned away from 
the bar to take in the place: neat-o! it basically looks like 
two rooms put together with the major dividing factor being 
an enormous, circular, open fireplace/firepit. this scored
major ambience points with me for several reasons: lighting, what 
better than fire, eh? ventilation- not a smokey fire- the flu must
be in proper working order! warmth- this was the first time in a 
long time that i took my jacket off before hitting the dancefloor,
and left it off for most of the evening. 
other stuff i saw: flashing colored christmas lights strewn about 
in a haphazard fashion, interesting, chatty crowd, few dancers (but 
this changed in time). i walked into Mei Lwun's set: he played 
a nice funky acid jazzish set- too bad folks weren't quite up to 
dancing yet- part of the non-dancing thing was created by this 
tapestry that manny had hung up that blocked the one room 
where the DJ was from the room where the bar was- once this was
torn down (by manny, shortly after Mei Lwun's set) dancing started 
to pick up. Mei Lwun was followed by Robert Rankin': he's a 
reggae DJ from Santa Cruz (i think that's where he's from?)- he 
played a great set and started me dancing. Many more joined in the dance 
about 2/3rds of the way through his set. Robert's a really great guy-
you should go to the next one just to meet him, if nothing else. 

Robert was followed by Gravy (i think?): i've never heard/seen him 
before to my knowledge- he played a fun hip hop set that 
set fire to the dancefloor- really got people moving. Since 
I had danced for most of Robert's set, I took a short break to 
rest my feet and get a coke. while at the bar, a couple of 
swingers tried to pick me up! What fun to be so wanted! Did 
I taunt? did I tease? I swear it must be my new shoes. the last time 
i wore them in tower records video department, somebody else 
tried to pick me up- seeing as our first chat was abpout the movie 
bitter moon, it's probably just as well that i didn't take him up 
on his offer ;) anyway, folks, that's what was really great about 
the place- the crowd- a great mix of people who really hung 
in there with a very friendly air throughout the moves from 
acid jazz to reggae to hiphop. very open, very friendly, lots of 
introductions all around. and if the gangstas were in the house, 
you wouldn't have known it from their attitude. also, the staff 
were some of the friendliest i've met in a looong time; and that 
despite the fact that people were passing back drink tickets to 
the bar most of the night and not tipping to boot!

i returned to dance to more of gravy's set, at which point, as
i was walking toward the floor, my friend turned to me and said,
"this is live." and then i noticed that toward the dj table, 
obscured by dancers, there was a group of people passing the mic 
and improvising rap to the dj's mix. Right on! 

I danced a bit more, said my adioses, and exited stage left 
around 1:40. definitely a worthwhile adventure: the spot, every other
wednesday, making the next one jan.4, 1995, $3 (includes one free drink), 
21+, robert rankin' will play again- don't know who else; 502 Auzerais
Ave. in SJ. Come prepared for mellow, chatty warmth.

p.s. Niels, you shouldn't miss the next one if you like the 
stuff that Robert plays- the only other venue he graces is
Ajax, and I have NEVER seen anyone dance there!

just a thought - i live in western australia, which is on the western 
side of australia.  if you find a map of the world you will see that 
australia has 8 different states and territories including tasmania which 
is a smaller island off the southcoast of eastern australia.  New 
Zealand is across from the south eastern coast of australia is actually 
composed of 2 isalnds which are not part of australia!  

as i have not yet been to N.Z. (new zealand) i do not know what their 
party and rave scene is like.

In australia, the best places for the rave scene is Sydney, Melbourne and 
of course Perth (which is where i am).  

if you would like to know any more about oz or about anything at all 
please e-mail me.  my mailbox will be out for about 1 week so between the 
25 December and 3 January i won't be able to reply.

Stay cool, keep raving, be happ-eee.

Oh, stay away from those capsules.  Because the capsules are made from
geletin, they turn you into Jello.  In fact, I saw one poor raver boy
take 10 capsules all at once and he turned into a Jellyfish.  Honest!

Of course, it wasn't because he was all relaxed or anything, he wasn't,
but he had vibrated all the bones in his body to dust.  He was the most
jittery Jellyfish I ever saw!

Hi Milty!

I looked up that Rue stuff in the drug archives.  Couldn't
find much except a reference that it was a MAOI.  Don't eat
that stuff with anything else and for heavens sake stay away
from Milk products.  You'll get sick as a frog.

You probably knew that.

Ciao,

Work has made it tough for going out mid week, but friday was that
day where everyone brings their kids in for the yearly parental 
dote fest, so I decided to telecommute (i.e. take the day off).
I wasn't really gonna go out thursday, but I called the Pure Space 
line.  Not only was it going to be at 1015 Folsom, one of my all time
favorite indoor venues, but it was going to go until "at least
5:30".  The last time I was at 1015 F. was months ago at a Come/Unity
when the police shut it down and confiscated the mixing board at 3am,
15 minutes into Jeno's set.

It was great to be back.  Spun was spinning a typically trippy and
erratic set when I got there, but with some truly inspiring segments.
The sound was great, deep rich bass, very loud, no distortion.  There
was a screen on the stage with your standard slide projector/video
visuals.  Unfortunately, they didn't use the house lights much, just
some strobes.  There were beanbag chairs and soft benches all over the
place, and the upstairs was open with some chairs and table.  It was
very comfortable.  There was also plenty of free water.  It never got
packed, but the vibe was thick and friendly with plenty of energy to
go around.  Not too many SFRavers that I knew; Geoff, Roxanne, David,
Grey.  I bumped into Galen who was doing some low key selective
flyering for Begin Again.  I don't want to give too much away, but
this party will definately be a rave, and there will be a map point
for the site.  This is not going to be a "100% bust free" event, but
Galen assured me that they have a lot of strategies for dealing with
the police.

Anyway, Markie took over and took me into high orbit with a fantastic
high energy trance-funk set; That alone was more than worth the $5.
Jeno followed with a good set as well.  The party ended at 5:30 with
my legs aching.  I had danced for 4.5 hours, and crawled away very
fulfilled.  Hmm, I wonder if the next Come/Unity there will go all nite
as well?  I might have to start telecommuting more. :-)

(warning - the following posting is off the subject)

If you're a DJ or aspire to be a techno/house musician, here is a
great way to start a complete home studio.  These items are available
as a set ONLY.

Roland TB-303		analog bass synth
Roland TR-727		digital drum machine with latin instruments
Roland TR-808		analog drum machine
Roland TR-909		analog/digital drum machine
Roland Jupiter 6	analog synthesizer keyboard.  latest ROM rev.
Roland MSQ-100		sequencer / midi to sync-24 converter
Roland MKS-10 Planet P	analog midi piano module (rackmount)
Roland BMR-5		rackmount effects, including parametric EQ,
			overdrive/distortion, chorus ensemble, 
			phaser and flanger.
Ensoniq ASR-10		rackmount sampler.  16Mb RAM, 1Gb Hard disk.  OS 3.0.
			numerous sound and effects disks and cds included.
Casio CZ-101		phase-distorition synth keyboard
Kawai XD-5		rackmount drum synthesizer
Kawai MAV-8		4-in 8-out rackmount midi patch bay
ART Phanton 2408	24 channel mixer 
Novation MM-10X		midi controller keyboard.  2 octave, velocity sensitive.
Owner's manuals		for all items except the MKS-10, BMR-5 and MAV-8
Service manuals		for TB-303, TR-808, and Jupiter 6
Rack enclosure		8-space
Cables			numerous, MIDI, sync and audio
Magazines and books	lots

For all the above I am asking $6000, or b/o.  When you add it up
it's a damn good deal.  

If you are a PC user, I will throw in the following for $350 extra:

Cubase for Windows	sequencer program, ver 2.5 with dongle and manual
ASR Tools		PC editor for the ASR-10
MOTU Midi Express PC	6-in 6-out intelligent midi patch bay (96 midi chans)
Roland MPU-401		midi interface card and unit
Midiman MM-401		midi interface card

Heck, for another $1000, I'll throw in a 486 and configure it all up for
you.  Due the amount of gear involved, it would be better if I could
find a Bay Area buyer, but I'm open to offers.  Please email if interested.

Yeah, yeah, I've been having that same problem with stuff that I sent out early
this weekend.

Is there a backlog somewhere or should we just re-send everything out again?

Oooh, will I go? 

Well, my dad's here from Brasil to visit me, so I may go if he lets me nap
some. It's great to have the dude around to harass! And friday, I will try
dubtribe's party. Maybe Milton sr. will accompany me to new year's, if he
promises to behave.

But he still can't get over my dress.

Well, folks, let's space it up! Rent Barbarella, rip off some costume ideas
or get really inspired! How hard can it be? Let your legs show, get a cape,
some silver fixins, and go girl!

I will have the MOST RETRO robot of all time ready, I hope, if my dad helps
me make it.

Wicked: I had a blast last year, but I also got slapped by security :( and
waited two hours in line for my under 21 friends to get in. Great music,
tho, but can't you hear it this saturday, too? Hmm......

Look at your face in the mirror for a looong time, even if doesn't melt,
you stare into your eyes 3 minutes (listening to plastic man helps!) and
you will hypnotize yourself into seeing yourself as a soul using this body
as a shell. See how your head can turn, but your eyes in the mirror stay
fixed in space. The body rotates around them, and they become tools of your
brain, and that is only a tool for your soul, a connection to this
physicaly biased world. That's all you are, a beautiful shell to protect,
carry and MOVE your even more marvelous  soul. 

And all bodily aspects become soo irrelevant right then. In you and others.
And then you will really love your friends even more, you will know they
are much more than what you see smiling back at you, they are all
butterflies in the same beautiful sky as you. And they will always be with
you.

Try it! It's my favorite part of "coming down"

Lotsa love,

Sea of Sin!(cynthia) She is one awesome mamma, usually in the escort of one
dapper and happy Handyboy (john), always in a good mood, perfect height (5

usually in the company of other chemistry/sunset crowd pleasers.

A note from The Huge Evergrowing Pulsating
Train Which Travels The ExpressWay To Yr Skull:
 
In the early days of Spring 1995, we will be putting on a FREE outdoor
event consisting mainly of ambient, trance, and experimental soundscape,
on a site in the Angeles mountains on the north side of the Los Angeles
basin.
 
Our motive is to create a sketch-free environment where people can chill
out all night and be exposed to new music and sounds.  There will be
a main area where the music will flow from trance to ambient to experimental
to tribal and back, and another chill-out space exclusively for ambient
and noise (non-traditional IntelliDansMusik).  We will also have poetry
readings, drumming circles, and screenings of obscure cult films.
 
We are currently looking for techno/ambient/electronica musicians and 
DJs who will be in the Los Angeles area mid-March and would be willing 
to volunteer their time and talent to help this event go off.
 
Anyone else who wishes to contribute in the way of performances, lights,
readings, sound, advice, and sheer inspiration, please feel free to contact
the Milk.Weed.Project through PAUL.GERONCA@SUPPORT.COM.
 
As for everyone else, more information will be presented as it is confirmed.
 
 
               I N    H E A V E N
               everything is fine
               
               on  11 march  1995
 
               details to follow.

The InterNIC got hyperreal.com's DNS record messed up (due to a 
combination of a stupid procedure policy on their part and a mistake on 
someone's domain registration form) and it reverted back to the old IP 
address on Wednesday - I was on the phone with them on Thursday and it 
was corrected and pushed out to the root-level caches by Friday evening.  
However, some sites probably still had the fuct IP address in their cache 
for a few days, but by today it should be cleared up.  If you can't get 
through, use "taz.hyperreal.com" which will definitely work.

Well, it might not help your pallor but I highly recommend a decongestant or
decongestant/anti-histamine the morning after.  It could just be me, but
having clear sinuses(NOT due to nose abuse by the way) can make you feel
worlds better and it just seems to help all around, not sure why.  My current
favorite is TavistD - works well, doesn't make you drowsy.  A natural version
would be echinacea - haven't tried yet.  Of course lots of orange juice or
the mega-every known herbal cure-fruit smoothie is good too.
Add a pain-killer and a little caffeine and you'll be  off mountain biking on
Tam all day like me.

Happy Holidaze,

Wow Milton.  Well said.  I'd be careful doing this if you're =by yourself or
in a non-supportive enviroment, aren't at some kind of peace with yourself,
and are still trippin hard.  Not that it wouldn't be a good cathartic
dismantling of your brain, it might just be more than you feel like dealing
with if you're pursuing entertainment rather than enlightenment.

In a random message about Wicked some time ago, Willis Wong sez:

Wow, I think we need more Smile Enforcers EVERYWHERE.

Smile Enforcers, be hereforth generated from WITHIN, and glide forth upon
the yet-to-be smiley population, as often and as much as possible!

You know you have to do it!

Hey I gotta question!  I went and saw Robbie Hardkiss last night here in
Austin and he played a song with a big old phat guitar in it.  Is this the
famed "Phoenix" from Godwithin that I've heard so much about.  It's hard to
say for sure but I think I remember hearing someone say "ROCK.....ON!"
during the track.  Does anyone know? DJ's?  Anyone?  Bueller?

Sorry if this is painfully obvious to you all out there, but this track does
*not* get played here in Austin and I can't find "Phoenix" anywhere either
to listen to it.  Thanks in advance!

the list seems to have slowed to a crawl...
kinda the opposite of the city which has been going off
this week - all that telecommuting and fat napping over
the weekend has everyone out partying

on that happy note, tribal funk's early bird holiday jam
sounds great  - I know some places do this cheap price early
business to get a party hopping but "before 7:30"?  Wow,
I can't get *anywhere* that fast after workin ... 
except maybe into my slippers ;^)

anyone out there?
anyone goin from the east bay tonight?

MORE NY EVE - thanks to those who wrote me about the
different parties - you can pretty much count on someone
from this list to be involved in about every party that
comes along, very cool!

I've got my pink satin alien invader
costume ready to go ...

Well, there was enough people to fill the King St. dance floor but just 
barely.  The music had a few choice moments but was not as energetic as I 
had hoped with John Howard filling in for Garth.  It ended abruptly at 6 
a.m.  The highlight for me was that I tried out my new Moon Shoes, which 
are like trampolines you strap on your feet...  A cross between a 
moon bounce and platform shoes, a must for any raver with feet smaller 
than size 9...   They're fun and big attention getters, look for me 
towering over the crowd and bouncing around.

Wicked,

I showed up quite by accident.  Like the previous post said, kind of empty,
which
actually was a highlight given that I don't really enjoy wicked's because they
are
so crowded.  I loved the fact that everyone was friendly, lots of really nice
people
were there.  I love the smiles and hugs I got.  I really liked meeting Clinton
and
Joshua.   David your moon shoes were just the greatest.  In all it was an
unusual
way to spend Xmas Eve, and it will go down in my history books as very fun.

Ron.

YEah I was there!

I remember watching you put on your moon bounce shoes and dancing around.

It was nice to have a party that was not overcrowded and tweeked out.

I thought Jeno played a pretty killer set and John Howard went off as well.

Not a bad warm-up for new years eve.

Thurs, 12/29

Sorry... that was a message I posted on Monday, and I presume due to the 
hyperreal confusion Brian posted about didn't get sent until today.

The Gardening Club is *NOT* happening tonight. It remains, as always, a 
Monday night affair. 

We will also be closed for roughly a month, due to permit problems...
We will reopen on January 30th.

In addition, The GC will essentially be the chill room for Wicked/Pure 
Space/Spundae et al on New Year's Eve--  Ambient/Dub/Jungle/anyhting goes 
with Synergy visuals and a jungle book environment.

Thanks to all who've been coming to support us...

Everyday is Christmas...

tony

Tim, Deaks and K-go practiced for almost twelve hours this week, they'll 
be spinning on six turntables and a sampler on Saturday for about 1.5-2 
hours from 11pm on.  
We are implementing plans to throw a free party if too many people show 
up at the indoor space so if you are coming and you get there to see a 
line outside stick with us you will have a party to go to (but bring your 
jacket! everyone)
If we ahve time we are going to build a dancefloor at the beach we are 
using :)
There is already a lot of firewood out at the beach to help keep us warm.
We also painted the floor of the theater we are using last night and it 
looks good.  
We hope to see you on New Year's Eve, but if you can't make it down I 
suggest you check out Begin Again!  that is our official alternative 
suggestion:)

Everyone please be safe and have a wonderful New Year's 
Eve!ATE1V1X4Q0&C1&D2 S7=255 S0=0

Hello my lovelies-

        I will be in town as of this evening (Friday). I'll be at WICKED
tomorrow evening so come and say hi. I'll be wearing a red shirt with black
racing stripes and zippers. I know it sounds kind of Michael Jacksonish but
it's not. Come bump me and say hello.

        Thanks for all of you guidance each and every one of you.

        Amous from the land of ZION!

Subject: Great Tracks from 1994 (long)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

 
Best-of-the-year lists are traditional at this time of year.  I'm never
sure exactly what their value is, but it's fun and perhaps useful to take
a look back.
 
Even though I consider 1994 to be a year lacking in the classics that were
so prevalent in 1993 (the tracks that were overplayed at the time but still
sound good, ranging from "Show Me Love" by Robin S to "Acperience" by
Hardfloor to Orbital's "brown album," for example), I think this was a year
of significant deepening and development in all genres of house/trance/techno/
rave music -- what I've been calling "future dance music" for some time.
 
What was basically a truly underground music production and distribution
system has rapidly gone commercial (although hardly big potatoes in the
overall scheme of the music industry), as seen by increasing -- and sometimes
stiflingly so -- production and packaging values.  1994 was, among other
things, the year the dreaded 12-remix triple pack began appearing frequently
in record bins, reflecting trends that by the end of the year have many
people reconsidering the whole notion of remixing.  Remixes aren't going to
go away, but perhaps there will be more attention to quality and individual-
ity, and much less of the paint-by-numbers approach that has reduced the
overall quality of remixes by "name" producers while perhaps improving sales
for the short run.
 
I'm a very selective buyer (about 1.5% of what I hear, typically), and still
acquired about 150 titles with 1994 copyrights or probable release dates.
My tastes ran strongly toward the UK this year, though the West Coast and
Detroit are getting my attention a lot now too.  This time, it's all vinyl
but I just got a Denon 2000F so no doubt CD issues will be a high priority
in 1995.
 
Three full-length albums deserve separate mention: Dajae's "Higher Power"
(including "You Got Me Up" and many others with the amazing Cajmere on the
mixing desk), Orbital's "Snivilization" which keeps improving on every
listen, and for hands-down album of the year, "The African Dream," every track
a classic and I just wish the remainder from the CD were also on the vinyl.
The one and only time I'd argue for a triple-pack release!
 
Of course it's hard to be fair in a "picks" list, and obviously quite a lot
of great music is not included here.  But for a few laughs at least, here's
my Preferred Dozen, another Choice Dozen, and quite a few Mentionables . . .
 
 
Phred's Preferred Dozen: 1994
-----------------------------
Airfix - Stick To It (Eat Vinyl, Bob!)
  Tribal house with a pure hook.  The flip of the EP, "I Found You," is
  also excellent.  Eat vinyl, and love it!
 
Boiling Point - I Am (Nice'n'Ripe)
  Uplifting, no-nonsense vocal of the year.  The New Jersey mixes exceed
  the London ones here.  Like Obsessive, Nice'n'Ripe is an under-rated
  label which recently put out an excellent compilation.
 
Cygnus Loop - Nyhabingi (Snoek)
  House music for the future.  An airy, diffuse breakbeat suddenly crumbles
  down into a cosmic, light-stepping romp.
 
Deep Freeze Productions - Feelin' Dub (Sure Shot)
  Is it deep house?  Progressive?  Who *cares* about labels!  Superb and
  off-kilter blend of beats and vocal loops on a wicked bassline.
 
Deep2 - Sphere II (Phoenix)
  LA musicians and producers are starting to put out *great* tracks, and this
  is one.  I prefer this live side over the studio one.  Deep but never
  suffocating.
 
51 Days - Tracktion (Touche)
  More sounds from the future of house.  A compelling and memorable track.
  Touche is definitely a label to watch.
 
Good Strawberries - Eyes on a Summer Day (M&G, Polygram)
  How to take a pop hit and *not* ruin it with a selfish remix.  The Gat
  Decor Mix 1 balances the lyricism of the original with their driving sound.
 
Needle Park - Crossfire (Wesayso)
  My perfect 5:30 am track: the Totally Wired mix.  Totally tripped out,
  totally driven, totally shake-ya-groove.
 
100th Monkey - Nyika Nyika (Boomtang)
  Unique cross of African vocals and floating house beats.  Makes Deep
  Forest sound like the sad pastiche it really was.  The "Boomtang boys"
  continue to put out consistently fine tracks (c.f. the "Rose Garden"
  remixes).  Toronto: the hidden gem of North American house.
 
Sensation - Beautiful Morning (550 Music, Sony/Epic)
  The perfect track to follow Crossfire.  Fluke has some kind of Key to
  the Groove; they prove it again on the Magimix here.
 
Underground Resistance with Yolanda - Living for the Night (UR)
  One of the gems from my Detroit visit.  Credits: Reynolds, Banks, Mills,
  what else is there to say?  I like the "Free Mix."  Great Detroit techno
  soul with a superb vocalist -- there's a lot of this coming out now.
 
Sven Vath - Monk Trance (Soil Samples, WEA)
  Quite different from the bald one's other output; this stands, er, heads
  above with responsible overdubs of chanting onto a rock-steady
  trance groove.
 
 
And Another Dozen . . .
-----------------------
Blunted Chimps - Love, Music, Sex (Shindig)
  A great EP, along with "Get It On" and "Don't Need It."  Smart UK house.
 
C&B Club - C&B Volume One EP (Platform 12)
  My vote for most balanced house EP of the year.  All four cuts, "Movin,"
  "Choc Rok," "Don't Ya?" and "Get the Rhythm" stand out.  Just reissued
  domestically with a couple of lesser tracks -- stick to the original.
 
Sharon Dee Clarke - Runaway Love (Rumour)
  Serious Rope follow-up to "Happiness" featuring my favorite house diva.
  How to turn a mediocre song into a great track with superb production
  and singing.
 
Graylock - Rising Horizon (Mental Radio)
  Tuneful techno, or transformed house.  Kinda hard to say which.  Sticks
  in the mind wonderfully, though.  Works well anywhere in the mid-130 bpms.
 
Kamasutra - Night Walk (Disco Magic, Touche)
  Originally on two Italian 10-inch disks, a huge hit on Touche with five
  superb remixes.  I like "Black Horses" best, with its Santana-ish *solo*
  (imagine that, a solo on a dance record!).  The "DJ's favorite" of fall 1994.
 
Angelique Kidjo - Agolo (Island)
  As commercial as a remix can be but well beyond.  Check the MK 10 Dub.
  Not everything Mark Kinchen does holds interest, but this does an excellent
  job of transforming Kidjo's superb original (she easily made my best-of for
  1994 in African music) without losing the essence.
 
The Question - Everybody (Black Sunshine)
  A pastiche of classic house sounds and the big deep beat and tongue
  firmly in cheek all the way.
 
Rebound - Rock the House (Manchester Underground)
  Everybody including me went for "Make It Funky," but I ended up liking this
  even more.
 
Subterfuge - Knowledge (Shifting Gear International)
  More soulful future house; hits the *spot*.
 
Vibe Academy - Jus' Love (Tumblin')
  Hard beats, divine vocals.  Kinda hard to beat that combo!
 
Vibe Tribe - Dance With Me (DJ International)
  Smart and varied remixes.  I only have the test pressing so I'll say,
  play the first track on each side.  Chicago meets New York with a twist.
 
Susumu Yokota - Hi (Space Teddy)
  Almost a toss-up with "San" a close second on this excellent EP.  Insightful
  and tuneful ambient techno.
 
 
Persistent Mention...
---------------------
Astral Matrix - High Tide (O.O.B.E.)  entire EP is excellent trance acid
BKS - I'm In Love With You (Radikal)  almost 17 amazing minutes on the flip
Boom Generation - Sweet Slam (Eat Vinyl, Bob!)  the next chapter!
Canyon - Tumbleweed Reprise (Bellboy)  triposonic
Clanger - Strata (Seismic)  more tranced-out ambientish technoey housey...
Deep Piece - Torwart (Limbo)  consistently good label, consistently good track
Delirium - Flowers Become Screens, Return to Babylon Mix (Nettwerk)  dubbbbbb!
Eastmen - U Dub (Tribal America)  you dig?
Fuzzy Logic - Lekker Vet (Whoop!)  or Lekker Vet/Fuzzy Logic?  anyway: yesss!!
In 2 Deep - Last Night (A DJ Saved My Life) (white label)  funky & driving
Killa Green Budds - Keep Slippin' (Strictly Rhythm)  1994, Third Floor stylee
The KK Kings - Disko Inv-Asian (Big Life)  bhangra house?! you bet!!
Lady B - Yes It Is (F)  it is not possible... to describe this...
New State Crew - Release Yourself (Bubblegum)  uplifting
Paradox - Funky Revolution (Strawberry)  people! power! yeow!
Peyote Dreams - State of Mind (Rhythm Design)  tribal tribal tribal
Roger S - Yes I Do (Freeze)  you better believe I do!
St Germain-en-Laye - Walk So Lonely (F)  *blues* house, unique and *good*
Shape Changer - Crystal Dreams Vol. I (Experimental)  excellent; great label
Sound Factory - Good Time (Logic)  as good as commercial house can be
Swag Bag - The Money EP (Higher State)  five innovative coins o' the realm
Technova - Tantrum (Sabres of Paradise)  my fave of the entire Sabres list
Todd Terry - Jumpin' (Freeze)  first two-thirds is hard house track of the year
3 Man Jury - Digital Autopsy (Kickin')  swirling acid
Triplepack - Join Hands (Urban Hero)  the We Are Family riff in a new galaxy
Trybet - Five Elements (Defective)  like Armani meets Atkins, maybe
Wintermute - Bushman (Skunk)  classic tribal excursion
 
 
A salute to you all for 1995, and remember . . .
 
  * * *  The sound is universal, but keep it underground and true.  * * *
 
 
"see you in the future"

Hello everybody...well, it's now the day before New Year's Eve, which,
by the way, you may have noticed, happens to fall on the evening of the
(um, morning...) of a new moon.

In honor of this event, the New Moon crew are doing the ambient room at
Begin Again, which will probably be the "undergrounded-est" of all the
newyearseve events this year.  Which means, lots of groovy people, lots
of FRESH dj's...but no underground event would be complete without YOU,
the Sfravers who believe in the "do it yourself" ethic.  

If you want to help us "do it up right" in the ambient space (which looks
like it's going to be ENORMOUS) please email me or gregg (gregg@fly1.berkeley.
edu) or just give us a call (voicemail: 415-267-3076, notvoicemail: 510-
525-7780).  We want to try for that sucks-you-into-the-deepest-of-chills
effect achieved at the Albany New Moon not long ago.

open invitation:  bring something for the altar, food and water to share,
a pet! (jus' kiddin') and something soft to rest your tired body on when
you just cain't dance no more....  also, if you still have it, bring your
list of lastyears newyears resolutions!  (to be ritually burned)

an' i want to say to everybody out there who've brought their beautiful selves
to newmoon events in the past:  thankyou for making 1994 the happiest in my
entire life!


love and kisses,

ann

i for one have no objection to self-promos, blatant or otherwise.
Where I would draw the line (and not in this case, this was the first
promo on this from Dave Alga) is *repetitive* promos, which are the
subject of a current tiff on dc-raves.

Sounds pretty reasonable to me, you wouldn't want the friends and

would you...;-)...

reruns
tribal funk's wednesday party was kinda weak
low energy, medium small rehersal space
with a big laser, black lights, and strobes
there was no escape ...
the dj I saw did alot of silly
rock n roll air guitar moves
like fake scratching 
unfortunately
his set was 
pretty 
dull

excuse the gaff about bsp..ffV depended on it to be what it 
was.
just tired of all the "dave alga this-dave alga that" lately...

i will say this though-the sfraves screensaver is cool and i 
met a shitload of you there. maybe dave should get a feel for 
where us camera hounds will be.
i hate the way massives go off up here.

from the cool world flyer-book:

"friendly security roaming the entire event"

what would milton think?

get to !begin again! early...
